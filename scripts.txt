"But how will you die when your time
comes, Narcissus, since you have no
mother?  Without a mother, one cannot
love.  Without a mother, one cannot die."

ALIEN III


THE SCREEN IS BLACK

A pinpoint of light appears.
Red.  An ember. 
Unseen BELLOWS blow.

GLASS FURNACE

The embers glow.  Flame.
The fire GROWS.

A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS

Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. 
White Hot.

GLASS FACTORY

Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls.  
Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of
intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood,
it too now old and dry.

SMOKE

Billows up the walls.
Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of
the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --

A MAN

On a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. 
His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. 
He is a MONK.

LOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open.
The smoke begins to escape.

The Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch --
Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX --
a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope.
He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --

MORE MONKS

By their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil.
They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished
pieces.  The old way.

ONE PARTICULAR MONK

Black skinned, early fifties.
Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but
he is watching something else.  It moves him to song.
Lilting tenor lifts high into the air.
This is BROTHER KYLE.

			BROTHER KYLE
	Well would he guess the ascending of the star,
	Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were.
	He knew the course of every malady,
	Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry.
	Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.

We see the object of his song:

BROTHER JOHN

Not yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.
The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.
A good face, nonetheless.
He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.
Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of
him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.

		       BROTHER KYLE
		Tend you quickly he will,
		with bottles from a shelf.
		But heals not, so easily,
		The ills which plague himself.

Brother John stops stirring.

		      BROTHER JOHN
		   (to Kyle)
		Enough.

He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the
Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool
mixture contacts the injured area.  

		     BROTHER JOHN
		  (to the burned Monk)
		Relax.
		  (to Kyle)
		Put those lungs of yours to better
		use.

		     BROTHER KYLE
		Yes, Doc Tor.

Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass --
a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end.

He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of 
iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. 

John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.

			     JOHN
		Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at
		late afternoon mealtime and don't come
		back to work today --

		     BURNED MONK
		But John --

			     JOHN
		I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today.
		You're lucky you only burned yourself on
		the side of the furnace.  If some of that
		glass had gotten on your arm --

He points to the top of his forearm.

	   	            JOHN
		-- it would've burned clean through to
		the other side.

He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm.
The Burned Monk shudders at the thought.  

BELLS toll.
 
		            JOHN
		That's late afternoon.  Now get on.

			BURNED MONK
		Thank you, John.  I --

			   JOHN
		You're welcome.  Go!

The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest.
John gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into a
burlap sack.  Kyle comes over.

			  KYLE
		Good work.

			  JOHN
		All right, but I'm no Father Anselm.

  			  KYLE
		You're yourself, that's better...

Kyle pushes him through the door...

INTO THE HALLWAY

The Hallway is alive with cassocked monks.
Their LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building.
The wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights.
This is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...

			KYLE
		The Abbot will be pleased.

			JOHN
		Don't.

			KYLE
		Don't what?

			JOHN
		Please don't tell him.  At least until
		I know if there's an infection.

			KYLE
		You want to be the Abbey's Physician,
		and you haven't learned the first rule:
		Don't worry about the patient.

John's face drops.

			KYLE
		I shouldn't have. Sorry.  Look, I know
		how you must --

			JOHN
		You don't, but thanks anyway.

AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY

A wide stairwell.  A constant stream of monks all moving down
the stairs.  Coming from floors above.  Headed for lunch.
Kyle starts down.  John starts up --

			KYLE
		Not coming down?

			JOHN
		I have someone waiting for me.

Kyle disappears into the crowd.
John moves up...

THE STAIRWAY

A river of brown cassocks running downstream.
John is the only one moving against the flow.
He exits the stairwell --

ONE FLOOR UP

A narrow corridor lined with doorways.
John moves to one in particular.
He doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.
This is his room.
He opens the door --

IN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM

An old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock
which is now serving as its bed.
At the sight of John it stands.

			JOHN
		Come on, Mattias.

The dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall.
Monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. 
Past another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.

INT. LIBRARY

A vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches
between aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves
jammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions
of books, from the looks of it.
From each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the 
book to be carried only as far as the nearest table.

A CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP

In his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his
position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large
KEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return
their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door,
then rises and joins them...

IN THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY

John leans against the wall as Philip exits.
Mattias is nowhere to be seen. 

			PHILIP
		Brother John.

			JOHN
		Brother Philip.

			PHILIP
		Feeding the mind instead of the body
		again?

			JOHN
		My training has taught me to feed what's
		hungry.

Philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.

			PHILIP
		As did mine.  As long as you're alone.
		Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book
		leaves the library.

			JOHN
		How could I forget?  Have a good meal...

John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs.
When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock
to reveal Mattias.

			JOHN
		Perfect.

They move into the library...

THE MEDIEVAL SECTION

The oldest books.
John moves to the stacks.
Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits.
This is his regular place.

AT THE SHELVES

John stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome.
He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding.
A smile plays across his lips.

He carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so
there is slack in the chain.
Sits on the bench next to the dog.
Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...

			John
	    	    (reading)
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --

			VOICE O/S
		Sometimes, I think you'd like that.

John turns to find --

THE ABBOT

Leader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger.
His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden
CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table.

John closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.

			John
		Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --

			ABBOT
		Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed
		him on the way up.  He said you'd come 
		in alone.  I knew better.

He scratches the back of Mattias' neck.

			ABBOT
		Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?

The dog snuffles in response.

			ABBOT
		You know what Philip says about Mattias'
		hair and his breathing.  You'll have to 
		take him out of here.

			JOHN
		He likes when I read to him and -- I 
		can't --

John looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels
almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  
The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.

			ABBOT
		    (smiles)
		Someone must have left this one unlocked.
		Take the book with you.

He hands the key to John, who is shocked --
this is a great honor.

			JOHN
		Father, I --?

			ABBOT
		Kyle tells me you did a good job at
		the glassworks today.

			JOHN
		I'll reserve judgement until the patient
		lives.

John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.
He returns the key.

			ABBOT
		It will get easier.  Father Anselm was...
		an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.

The Abbot walks towards the door...

			ABBOT
		Just have it back before the end of lunch.
		Oh -- And I didn't see you in here.

			JOHN
		Thank you.
		      (to Mattias)
		Let's go upstairs, boy.

John takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase.
Mattias at his heels.
Goes UP --

INTO THE BELL TOWER

The mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs
cast scary shadows.
A doorway leads to --

THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Thick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches.  
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey
is actually --

THE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT

The door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID!
The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the
Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below.  
SMOKE curls from vents set into the surface.
Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS.

This is ARCEON.
An manmade orbiter.
A shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter.
Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable
level within finished in whatever material suits its end user.

This orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been
sheathed in wood.

JOHN

Walks to the shore of an inland SEA.
Sits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up.
His eyes grow accustomed to --

THE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV

Freckled with tiny dots of light.
Stars.  Spread across the inky void.
Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.

John smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. 
The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. 
He opens the book.
Reads aloud --

			JOHN
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day
		by day, one by one, until I am the only 
		one left.  I stayed as long as I could bear 
		it, then with my dog -- 

Mattias lifts his ears at this part.  His favorite part.

			JOHN
		- fled.  I have put this to parchment lest
		this pestilence - this Black Death - 
		stay my hand.
			(beat)
		This was finished by another hand...

John closes the book.  Something catches his eye --
Something among the myriad points of light in the sky.
Millions of miles away:

ONE OF THE STARS

Brighter than the rest.  MOVING.
Fast enough to leave a faint trail.
Across the stars.  And down...
A comet.

John stands.  Watches --

THE STAR

Growing brighter.
Drawing nearer.

JOHN

Joined by three other MONKS.
They are older than he.
The Four men watch the sky...

THE STAR

Brighter still.  Closer.

MORE MONKS

Two dozen.  A hundred.
They come up through the planet's surface.
Out of wooden trap doors.  Join the others.
Days pass.
Now three hundred.
Necks bowed back.
Mouths agape.
A SUBTITLE identifies...

			RELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON
			-----------------------
			POPULATION: 350 Exiles
			CRIME:  Political Heresy

THE STAR

Fills the sky.
Burns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere.

ON THE SURFACE OF ARCEON

Hundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star --
ROARS over their heads.  Trailing FIRE --

John holds up his hands - to touch a star --
Skin BLISTERS as it passes over him,
He turns and watches as it --
Arcs downward --

INTO THE SEA

WHOMP- SSSSSSSSSS --!!
PLUMES of steam rise into the air.
The water boils.  Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead.

JOHN

Is the first to hit the shore.
Small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.
His coracle is the first into the water.
The others running up behind him.
He cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning.

ON THE SEA - DAWN

The sun cracks over the black water.
John's hands move the rough wooden oars.
Blistered palm opens.
BLOOD flows.
He tears off a piece of his cassock --
Rips it with his teeth --
Wraps the bloody hand.
Rows.

THE STAR

Ship.  Star Ship.
Sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water.
White metal skin blackened by the heat.

JOHN

Rows right into it.
His coracle pitches in the choppy surf.  
He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface.
Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH.
Looks around for a knob, a handle --

NEXT TO THE HATCH

A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote
urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny
metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat.
Then quickly pulls it down...
WUORRRSH -!
Hull door OPENS.

The doorway is a black maw.
John crosses himself.
Begins to lower his foot into the hatch --

			KYLE O/S
		Watch it!

He almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back --

THE OTHER MONKS

Are rapidly approaching.
Kyle gestulates wildly --

			KYLE
		John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in!

John turns back to the open hatch.
Machine recirculated air flows out.
He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool.
Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him.
He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness --

WHOOSH-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY

Dark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to
the darkness.  He sees:

NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE

A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its
base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the
head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt
warning -- is audible...

			COMPUTER VOICE
			(sotto)
		Seal broken...seal broken...

John finds himself moving towards the tube...
Looks through the broken lid:

IN THE TUBE

There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white
interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown.
Whatever happened here happened a while ago.
Rust colored drips trail down to --

THE FLOOR

Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of
Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.
Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.

JOHN

Looks back towards the door.
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights
back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone
in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- 
Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and
glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 

LIGHTS

Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.
Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.

It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and
never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear
now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....

ON A PALE GREEN SCREEN

LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07
A legand identifies "Elapsed since separation."
He moves on...

A VIDEO MONITOR

Through scanning bars of snow, an image:
A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her.
The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl.
Protective. Maternal.

The Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself.
A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is.

			WOMAN
		...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS
		Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead.
		Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper
		sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has
		hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed.
		Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt 
		and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...

The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear.
He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship,
following the trail of blinking instruments --
Drawn to touch a button.  Click...

SOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER!
Just an oxygen mask.

John feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the
plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. 
His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and --

HSSSSSSSSS -!
A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe --
John SHOUTS and back up into --

ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!!

Next to Newt's now empty tube.
Humming gently.  Still operational.
John approaches it cautiously.
He can make out the occupant through the lid...

A WOMAN

The woman from the screen.  This is RIPLEY.
In hypersleep.  Wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer-type
shorts.  Christ, she looks beautiful.  

John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back.
Sinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear
again.  Moves his face closer to the lid.  
Closer to hers...

DAYLIGHT spills in --
John's head WHIPS towards the source of the light --

THE DOOR

Open.  Kyle and the other monks.

			KYLE
		John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?

			JOHN
		No.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone
		in here --

The Second Monk looks at Kyle.

			SECOND MONK
		This is forbidden.

			KYLE
		John.  Just get the hell out of there --

			JOHN
		I don't want to stay.  I have to get her
		out before this sinks.  You come in, give
		me a hand --

			KYLE
		Her?  Look, this is not the supply ship,
		so this is technology forbidden to us.
		Get out of there now!

John looks down at Ripely.
A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube.
A red button:  "EMERG-OPEN"
That's plain enough.

			JOHN
		All right --

He presses it.
The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air.
The Monks at the door recoil at the sound.

						CUT TO:

EXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY

Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in
front of him.  Unconscious.  
Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. 
The monks start to row back to short.

			FIRST MONK
		     (reverent)
		A space ship...

			SECOND MONK
                    (even more reverent)
		A woman...

			KYLE
		You shouldn't have gone in --

			JOHN
		I'm supposed to be a doctor.

He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.

			JOHN
		She could've been lost.

			FIRST MONK
		Been a long time since I saw either.

			SECOND MONK
		It isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we
		supposed to do with it?

			KYLE
		What was it like in there --?

			JOHN
		Lights.  So many lights --

			THIRD MONK
		Tow it in.  Bring it in.

			SECOND MONK
		It's evil.

			FIRST MONK
		It's just technology.

			SECOND MONK
		Evil technology.  Look at these fish --

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know what we should do
		with it --

			KYLE
		Just lights?

			JOHN
		Machines.  Buttons.  Metal.

			SECOND MONK
		See?  Just look at the fish.

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know.

			SECOND MONK
		They're boiled.  These fish are boiled. 

			JOHN
		Thousands of lights.  Like the stars.
		Like Heaven on Earth.

Ripley stirs in John's arms.  Groans.
Fights to come out of her fugue state...
Looks around through half-lidded eyes --
She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks.
MONKS?  She closes her eyes.
Tries to clear the imagine.  Opens:
They're still there.
She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist --
realizes she's sitting on someone's lap.
Looks back over her shoulder --

JOHN

He smiles at her.
Friendly, not sexual.

RIPLEY

Shakes her head.  Tries to speak --
Her lips form soundless words.
She looks over her other shoulder, sees --

THE SHIP - RIPLEY POV

Bobbing on the surface.  
Growing small with each stroke of the oars.

RIPLEY

Brows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain.
Tries to focus on the ship --
Remembers. 
Turns to John, tries to speak --

			RIPLEY
		Wait.  New...

She loses consciousness.  

						GO TO BLACK...

INT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Streaks of light move across the darkness.
Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls.
There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are
the muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey --
The SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING.
WHISPERED prayers.
LILTING song.

We move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed.
Ripley in restless sleep.

EXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK

The waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across
white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their 
boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes --
Start to tow it to shore...

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ripley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe --
She tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of
the suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes:

JOHN

Sits next to her.  Quite asleep.
Hands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap.

She squints to make the figure standing in the shadows
behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of
flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves --

THE ALIEN

Big, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light.
It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side --
moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - 
to cry out -- She can't.

She can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping
peacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien --

The Alien moves closer.  
She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her
forehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move --

The Alien stands alongside her bed.
Extends a six-fingered hand...
Gently rests it on her stomach.
Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something.
The implication is clear.

Ripley finds her voice --

			RIPLEY
		AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!

Her eyes open wide --
She sits bolt upright.

A hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to
the pillow.  John's.

			JOHN
		You're out of it.  Out of it...

Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared.
John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder:
Nothing.
Ripley's eyes roll back into her head.
She tries to speak -- It was there.
Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist --

John's hand covers hers.
Eases the fingers open again.
She feels the coarse bandages against her palm.

He starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions.
She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her
like waves lapping against the shore...

EXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY

A HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round
goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a 
huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement --

Hundreds of ropes grow TAUT.
Timbers GROAN.
They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal --

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Ripley lays with eyes closed.
Muffled VOICES outside her door:

			ABBOT
		How is the woman, John?

			JOHN
		I don't think she's here yet.

At the sound of John's voice the SLIGHTEST smile plays 
across Ripley's sleeping lips.

			JOHN
		She is close, though.

As they continue talking, Ripley wakes.  Opens her eyes.
Rolls over onto her side --
There is a window right next to the bed.
Ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:

HER POV

Garden of Earthly delights...
Monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky --
picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes.
Working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.  Lyrical.
It makes her feel good.  She scans the countryside...

Sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet
up to the -- Ripley does a take --

WORKERS ON A SCAFFOLDING

With crude brushes at the end of poles -- PAINT the sky blue.
The Abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all
on one level - INSIDE THE PLANET.

The vaulted CEILING, painted to look like the sky with huge
glass "windows" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the
UNDERSIDE of the planetoid's outer shell.

Ripley looks back at the Monks on the ground:
Instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking
the wood onto push carts --

			RIPLEY
		What the hell --?

SUDDENLY --
The Sulaco Escape ship APPEARS in front of her.
SWINGS past her window suspended by ropes.
Then disappears up, out of sight.
Ripley checks her pulse.

			RIPLEY
		This must be a dream.  A bad one.

She rolls back onto the bed.
Stares up at the ceiling.

ABOVE HER - ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Monks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place on
a flat area of the roof above the libaray.
It seats with a deeply resounding THUD...

RIPLEY

Hears the SOUND and then another - her door OPENING.
She turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway.
John waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair by
the bed and sits.

			RIPLEY
		Who are you?

			ABBOT
		I am the Abbot.  Leader of this Colony.
		And you?

He smiles.  Open.  Friendly.

			RIPLEY
		Ripley.  How did I get here?

			ABBOT
		Your vehicle crash landed.
		     (indicates John)
		Brother John found you and brought
		you here.

			RIPLEY
		Where is here?

			ABBOT
		This is the Minorite Abbey within the
		manmade orbiter Arceon.

			RIPLEY
		Can I use a radio to --
	
			ABBOT
		We have no radio here.  We are a monastic
		order that has renounced all modern
		technology.  We live the old way.  The pure
		way.

She shakes her head.

			RIPLEY
		Uh, I - I still don't feel 100%.  Whoever
		took me out of the stasis tube must not 
		have run the full D-F program...
		Where's Newt?

The Abbot looks at her blankly.

			RIPLEY
		There was a little girl with me --

			ABBOT
		You were alone.

			RIPLEY
		No.  She was with me.  I put her in her
		stasis tube -- We launched when the --

			ABBOT
		You were the only living thing found
		aboard that vessel.

The Abbot watches Ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her --

			RIPLEY
		     (slowly)
		Oh, God.  Newt.

She stops -- gets that chill up her spine --
She realizes that she MUST have brought the Alien with her.

			RIPLEY	
		It came with us.

The Abbot leans in.

			ABBOT
		What came with you?

			RIPLEY
		Listen -- there is a danger here.  It
		came with me.  How long have I been here?

			ABBOT
		Almost two days --

			RIPLEY
		     (calculates)
		Loose for two days.  This planet could be
		overrun within the week.

Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock --

			RIPLEY
		Look, there's a xenomorph --
		    (sees his confusion)
		An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster.
		And now it's here.

The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner
of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The
guy with his pants down around his kness.

She sees this, releases her hold on him...
	
			RIPLEY
		Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a
		platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission
		to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six
		months ago - maybe a year --

			ABBOT
		     (interrupts)
		Wait a moment --

The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway.
Turns over his shoulder at him.

			ABBOT
		Leave us.

John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door.

			ABBOT
		Continue.

			RIPLEY
		We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from 
		Gateway sub-orbital space station --

			ABBOT
		Not possible.

			RIPLEY
		What do you mean?

			ABBOT
		When we left Earth seventy years ago, it
		was on the brink of a New Dark Age.
		Technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planet's environment.  A computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
		way it could be averted.  In the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep, the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse.
		Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass, and the Earth
		no longer existed.

Now she gives him that look.
	
			RIPLEY
		    (slowly)
		Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How
		many people do you have here?  Let's worry
		about them.  Warn them --

A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear.  
Now she's getting to him - or is she?
He abruptly stands. 

			ABBOT
		Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest
		some more.

			RIPLEY
		I don't need rest - I need to get to 
		your people.  You've got to get to them --
		tell them about the alien --

He heads for the door --

			ABBOT
		I have had enough for now.

			RIPLEY
		Enough?  Didn't you hear what I said?
		It could wipe out the entire population
		of this planet.  It may have started 
		already - Have there been any unusual 
		deaths since I got here?

The Abbot stops in the door -

			ABBOT
		No.  And there won't be.

The Abbot SLAMS the door behind him.

THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

John stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS

			ABBOT
		Bolt it.

The guards move to bolt the door.

			JOHN
		What is it -- What's wrong?

			ABBOT
		Your patient is in a dangerous mental
		state.  Nobody gets in or out until I
		say so.

			JOHN
		But I.  Her meals --

			ABBOT
		Nobody.

			JOHN
		Father, I don't understand --

The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall.
John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks.


THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

John has his head buried in his hands.  His back rises and falls
with the rhythmic breathing of sleep.
Mattias curled up on his feet.  Asleep as well.
WHAM!
The Library door FLIES open --!
John sits bolt upright -- 

A HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in.
Rushes to John's table.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Brother John!  You're here!  The Abbot
		said you'd -- I need -- you're the
		medic --

			JOHN
		What?!

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		My Sandy -- she's ill --

John tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes.

			JOHN
		Huh?  A woman?

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Sandy.  My ewe.

John returns his head to the table.

			JOHN
		One of your sheep?  Jesus Christ.
		Call a vet.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Father Anselm was the vet.

John looks under his arms at Mattias --
The dog just stares at him.

			JOHN
		You're no help.  Okay, let me get my bag.
		All creatures great and small...

INT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT

A small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens
in wire cages.  The wooden walss are full of gaps where boards
have been ripped off.

The Hysterical Monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene.  One of
his sheep is laying on its side...

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		I just gave her dinner and she
		keeled over.

			JOHN
		So would I.  It's freezing in here.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Been using the wood from the walls
		for the fire in my cabin.

			JOHN
		Haven't we all...

John kneels at the ewe.

She's breathing heavy.  Rapidly.

John puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he
checks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand.  
She gives a weak "Baa-ah."

			JOHN
		May be pneumonia.  Pitch some of that hay
		around her.  Stop this damn cold breeze.

The Hysterical Monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and
retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall.
Starts to pile hay around the fallen animal.

			JOHN
		First, I'll --

He sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what's
on his left hand --

A SLIMY MUCOUS-LIKE SUBSTANCE

			JOHN
		Wait a minute...

The Hysterical Monk stops on mid-pitch.
John rubs the material between his fingers.
Brings it close to his nose.  Sniffs.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What is it?

			JOHN
		I don't know.  It's all over the ground.
		Some sort of --

BAAA-AAAH!!!
The ewe starts to SHAKE - QUIVER --
John tries to hold it down --
The Hysterical Monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What?!  WHAT?!

			JOHN
		Jesus!  Help m --

The ewe is shaking so violently that John is thrown back --
He knocks over the bucket -- the torch falls into the hay --
The light is cut off as the torch almost smothers.
Then the hay starts to burn --
Weak fire light revealing:

BAAaa-Aha-SCLORTCH-H-!!
THE EWE EXPLODES ---!

Stomach BURSTS --
SPRAYING the two Monks with entrails and blood --
They start SCREAMING.

The flickering FIRE LIGHT grows as...

A TERRIBLE ALIEN CHEST-BURSTER

BURSTS out of the jerking and twitching carcass.

It shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has
gestated.  Tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass-like eyes
peer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore-matted
WOOL.  A quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free
itself from the cooling morass of intestines.

John can only SCREAM as the most horrible nightmare he can
imagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil.

The Hysterical Monk, fear overcome with ANGER at the loss of
his beloved Sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic Medic
and instinctively THRUSTS his pitchfork into the creature --
The sharp prongs PIERCE its still forming body --

The CREATURE

WAILS a high pitched SHRIEK - half alien, half sheep as it is
roughly TORN from it's nesting place --
The Monk lifts --

It TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the
wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE.

The Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire --
The entire corner of the barn is ablaze --
SHOVES the abomination in --

The Sheep/Alien POPS and SIZZLES as tongues of flame leap up to
lap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about --

The creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound
heard within the barn.  The Hysterical Monk holds his fork in
the flame as he looks back to check on --

JOHN

Face contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature.  Heaving
lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from
his open mouth -- The Doctor in training has seen the devil.

EXT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT

Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre.
Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out
across the rafters...

We pull back from the sight INTO a window. Into

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ripley, watches the burning barn.  Frustrated, she climbs out of
the bed on unsteady legs, wearing her tank top and shorts.
Pulls on a coarse wollen cassock, ties the rope belt --

			RIPLEY
		Idiots...I'll --

WHAM!
The door BURSTS OPEN --

			RIPLEY
		What the -?

Four BURLY MONKS rush in and grab her.
TEAR her out of bed --

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway.

			ABBOT V.O.
		An evil has come to Arceon...

IN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGHT

As he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending
at the Abbots...

			ABBOT
		You heard Brother Graham tell of the
		devil inside sheep's wool --

He motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd.

			ABBOT
		An evil brought by this woman in her
		vessel of technology.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet
high.  Light creeps in through stained glass windows.

Hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over
the floor of the Tribunal.  On the floor:

The Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing
the witness stand.  On the stand:

RIPLEY

Considers the faces that surround her.  Fear.  Hate.

			RIPLEY
		This can't be happening.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		You have no voice in this tribunal.

			RIPLEY
		You must listen to me!  You're all in
		terrible danger!  It came with me on
		the ship --

			ABBOT
		We know that.  At first we believed its
		arrival was a good omen.  But it has only
		brought pestilence.  Dead sheep.  Dead fish.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		Evil.

Ripley turns to the Abbot.

			RIPLEY
		Yes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It
		brought the Alien.  I told you, it's here.

			ABBOT
		We know the name of the evil it brought.
		It brought technology.  Technology to
		destroy our planet, as surely as it
		destroyed the Earth.

			MONK IN AUDIENCE
		Destruction!

			RIPLEY
		I was on the Earth less than a year ago.
		It's still there.  People, cities, all 
		still there!

A murmur through the crowd.  Some are listening to her.
The Abbot looks around.  He must be in command.

			ABBOT
		    (matter of fact)
		All dead.

			RIPLEY
		    (screams)
		It's still there!

The Abbot smiles to himself for making her crack.
He stands and begins to pace.

			ABBOT
		You could not have been on the Earth a
		year ago, because there is no Earth to
		be on -- for at least twenty years.

			RIPLEY
		I haven't been floating in space for
		twenty years.  Let me get to my ship
		and I'll prove it.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		No.  Who knows what new evils she'll
		release if allowed back into that
		infernal machine.

			MONK IN AUDIENCE
		No!  Don't let her!!

			TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		This woman is a danger.  She denies The
		New Dark Age.  She denies reality.

			RIPLEY
		This is reality.  There is a Xenomorph
		loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must
		have stowed away on my ship -- must have
		killed --
			(swallows hard)
		Newt.  Killed the girl I brought with me.
		You can't stop it.  It goes inside you like
		an egg - grows -
			(mimes)
		Explodes out of you - keeps growing into
		some sort of monster.  Kills you --
		Kills all of you...

She looks at the Medieval people around her.
They stare at her in complete confusion.
To them, she does sound like a madwoman.

			RIPLEY
		Who are you people?  Look at you -- all
		of you -- the way you're dressed.  This
		isn't the Middle Ages.  You're in space --
		on a artifical planet.  What are you
		doing out here?

There, in the upper tier -- John.  They make eye contact. 
She looks to him pleadingly.

			RIPLEY
		Isn't there anyone here who will
		listen?

John looks from Ripley to the Abbot.
The Abbot stares him down.
John turns away.

			RIPLEY
		    (defeated)
		I guess not.  I can't believe this...

The gavel BANGS.
The Abbot sits in a moment of contemplation.

			ABBOT
		Then there is no choice.

The Four Monks grab Ripley roughly --
Bind her arms.

			ABBOT
		   (to Ripley)
		The evil is inside you.  I cast you down.
		To be sealed away.  And God have mercy on
		your soul.

						SLAM CUT TO:

THE SHAFT ROOM - DAY

A Medieval elevator shaft.  The "elevator" is a wooden cage
lowered on thick, rough hewn ropes.
Ripley, bound, is led to it.

She looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door --

			RIPLEY
		You won't be able to fight it...
		You don't know what it is --!

She's put into the cage.  The door is secured.
Two monks begins to pull the ropes.  The cage is lifted out over
the abyss -- a vast cavernesque space.

The other Monks move closer.  Crowd around the edge --
John pushes through them - right to the edge --
Watches as the cage is slowly lowered down...

Ripley looks directly at John --

			RIPLEY
		You've sentenced yourselves to 
		death!

John watches as she disappears down into the darkness...
Then turns and pushes his way through the crowd --
Down the hall --

THE TRIBUNAL ROOM

Empty now except for the Abbot and the Tribunal Members.
They speak in hushed tones.
John appears in the doorway, but pauses -
strains to hear what they are saying:

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		...they'll have started before she gets
		down to the Hermitage level.

			ABBOT
		No trouble?

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		Only finding the wood for the ship.  But
		Anderson's hut was about that big, and
		he's dead three months now.

			ABBOT
		I had that wood earmaked for the Cloister 
		next winter.  Well, we might not get to
		the winter if we don't take care of this.
		By winter time we can start taking the 
		penitent cells apart.  No one in them.

			ANOTHER TRIBUNAL MONK
		The wood isn't going to last forever.

			ABBOT
		Neither are we --

He becomes aware of John's presence, and motions the other
Tribunal members out of the room.  John moves to the Abbot.
The Abbot knows what's coming...

			ABBOT
		Go ahead.

			JOHN
		This woman.  Ripley.  I tended her --

			ABBOT
		Yes, and you did a good job.  You
		shouldn't feel responsible.  You
		couldn't have known --

			JOHN
		Please, sir, let me finish.  I feel that
		there may be something to what she says.

			ABBOT
		There isn't.

The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel,
notebook.  John follows him --

			JOHN
		I don't understand what you are doing.

			ABBOT
		This colony is my responsibility.  I am
		protecting the colony.

			JOHN
		From what?  This woman?  You never gave
		her a chance.  How can you be so sure
		you're right?

			ABBOT
		A better question is what makes you
		think I'm wrong?

			JOHN
		You didn't see this thing -- this demon --
		Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it.

			ABBOT
		      (realizes)
		That's right.  You both did.
		      (beat)
		And what was it?

			JOHN
		I -- I don't know what it was.  But I
		don't think Ripley was a party to it.

			ABBOT
		She admits she brought it.

			JOHN
		But she tried to warn us --

			ABBOT
		You know that's how the devil works.
		Deception.

			JOHN
		But I believe her.  I don't know how to
		describe it -- A feeling.

			ABBOT
		You haven't seen a woman in thirty years.
		Where does this feeling originate, John?

			JOHN
		     (points to his head)
		Here.

Pause.

			ABBOT
		I believe you.  But your feelings are
		fooling you.  

			JOHN
		It's - It's her conviction.  I just think --

The Abbot snaps at him --

			ABBOT
		Don't think.

John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never
heard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair.
Forces a smile.

			ABBOT
		It's been a long night.  For all of us.
		You really don't understand what you're
		dealing with here.

			JOHN
		That's what she said.

The Abbot chafes.

			ABBOT
		These are ideas which threaten the very
		system we live under.  The creature is
		dead and the woman is gone.  Forget them.
		Both.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere,
		but leave this alone.

			JOHN
		But I --

			ABBOT
		Alone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias
		into the Library, all right?  For your
		own good, just stay out of this.

John looks like he's going to protest.

			ABBOT
		I mean it.

			JOHN
		     (slowly)
		Yes, Father.

John turns and leaves the room.  
The Abbot stares after him.


INT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

Dark. Dank. Dreary.
A NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another.
The board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered.

Another board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM -
HAMMERED in tight.


TWO ANCIENT WORKERS

Drab, torn gray clothing.
Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall.
Methodically covering up --

RIPLEY

Watching them work.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
Defeated.


ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY (INTERCUT)

A dozen Monks frantically hammer planks up around the Sulacco
escape ship - A frame of wood --
begin to wall it in...


IN THE PRISON LEVEL

The two ANCIENT WORKERS continue their carpentry.
The planks cover more of the opening.
BAM-BAM-BAM.

Covers more of Ripley.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
She stares...


ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Planks are rising around the ship.
Covering it.  Locking away the good omen turned evil.

IN THE LIBRARY

John and Mattias sit before an open book.
He doesn't read.  He can hear the POUNDING of the hammers.
It seems to reverberate THROUGH the planet.
Through his SKULL.
He closes his eyes in pain.

RIPLEY

Only her face is visible.
Another board.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
Then just her eyes.

Just before the last plank is put in place --

			WORKER
		Here you go, woman.  Something from your
		ship.  Something to keep you company --

He tosses it into the cell.  Ripley catches it.
Watches as the last of the light is covered over.
BAM-BAM...BAM.

She continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow
accustomed to the darkness.  The little light creeping between
the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see
what it is she has caught --

NEWT'S DOLL'S HEAD.

Ripley looks around her cell -- actually a narrow space behind
other cells, one wall curved out -- like a narrow slice
crossways towards the edge of the pie. 
Looks at the Doll's head in her hand.
A beat.

She FREAKS OUT --!

			RIPLEY
		You fucking idiots!  You're dead!
		You're all dead!

BEATS the walls.  KICKS.
SMASHES her HEAD against the wall.
Again.
Her nose starts to bleed.
Her hand goes to her nose.
She squints in the darkenss.
Sees the BLOOD.
Tastes the iron taste in her mouth.
Death is with her again.

			RIPLEY
		     (sotto)
		Dead...

The "widest" part of her cell, the middle, allows her to slide
down into a sitting position.  She does.

			RIPLEY
		Christ.  Jesus Christ.  It's here.  Here.
		Shit.  Here.  I can't get rid of it...

Looks at the Doll's head --

			RIPLEY
		Newt.  This isn't what I wanted...

She throws the doll's head away --
It bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position
so that it is staring at her.

			RIPLEY
		     (snaps)
		Don't stare at me!

Beat.

			VOICE O/S
		Sorry.

Ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her --
Where it meets the floor, in the rotting timbers:
A HOLE.  In it:

A MAN'S FACE

Bright, wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut.
He's looking back at her.


ON THE ROOF OF THE MONASTERY - NIGHT

The Sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the Monks have
finished walling it up.  Now just another part of the Abbey.

As the Monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow --
Pass them -- down to an open window and into...


INT. LIBRARY - THE MEDIEVAL SECTION - NIGHT INTO DAWN

John is here, Mattias asleep at his feet.
The tables, the benches, the floor are COVERED with hundreds of
books he's pulled off the shelves, their chains all TANGLED.
All open to --

PICTURES OF DEVILS

Different representations of Evil through the ages --
Lucifer, Shaitan, Ahriman, Asmodeus -- Satan.
"The Temptation of Christ" from the Master of Schloss
Lichtenstein.  Satan roasting on an enormous grill from
"Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry."

The devil as a serpent.  As a semi-humanoid.
Gruenwald's "Temptation of St. Anthony."
Pacher's "Saint Wolfgang and the Devil."
A miasma of Medieval Monsters.


JOHN

Picks his way through the mess.  Like a man possessed he fumbles
through book after book.

The first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge
stained glass windows.  John rapidly flips through the Medieval
tome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted
as having a FACE on his ASS -- further still -- then stops.
This is it.

We can't see what the illustration is, but we see his REACTION:

His eyes open wide as saucers.  SLAMS the book closed as if the
image would strike blind.  He turns to Mattias as if to say
something -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog.

John wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot
up against the shelf.  Pulls -- SPANKT!
The old chain gives way.

Face set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag
over his shoulder.  Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets
his sleeping dog and goes...


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOT'S OFFICE - DAY

John strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and
flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's 
office opens suddenly --

BROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the 
room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other
direction.  He is gagged.  A third Burly Monk moves out of the
doorway with the Abbot.

			JOHN
		Now find John and have him brought to 
		me immediately.

			THIRD BURLY MONK
		Yes, Father.

			ABBOT
		Start in the library.  And keep it quiet. 

The Third Burly Monk nods and moves off.
The Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and
closes the door.  John stares at the closed door a beat and then
makes up his mind.  He turns and runs back down the hallway...


INT. GLASS FACTORY - DAY

The first Monks straggle in for the morning shift.
Kyle is among them.  He lifts his blowing iron from a wall
mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two
other Monks begin to stoke the fire.

John enters.
Looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find --


KYLE

At the glass furnace.  About to dip his blowing iron into the 
MOLTEN GLASS.  John runs over to him.
Almost knocks him over --

			KYLE
		Hey!  Watch it!

He sees that John is agitated --

			KYLE
		What?  What is it?

The other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in
for a look...

			JOHN
		I -- Abbot.  Must --

John tries to catch his breath.  He gestulates wildly.
Kyle puts down his blowing iron.

			KYLE
		John - relax.  Take a deep breath -
		Christ, now I sound like you --

He sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands.

			KYLE
		Is that it, John?  Is it the book --?

			JOHN
		     (panting)
		Yes.  Devil.

Kyle moves closer to him.  Cautiously.
John sees the other monks gathering around --
Closing in on him - whispering --

			WHISPERING MONKS
		He's got it...

			SECOND WHISPERING MONK
		Like the Comet Woman...

			THIRD WHISPERING MONK
		He found her...
		
			WHISPERING MONK
		He's infected...

John sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell
the Abbot.  John looks into his friend Kyle's face -- Fear.

			KYLE
		Everything's gonna be fine.  Now, let's
		see the --

			JOHN
		Don't humor me -- I'm --
	
			KYLE
		Sure.  Everything's gonna be fine...

If only he could explain - he can't.
John YANKS the book away -- spins --
Bursts through the crowd...

			KYLE
		Wait -- JOHN!


INT. SHAFT ROOM - DAY

The cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss.
John runs in.  Moves to the ropes.  Places the book on the floor.
Tightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing:  
The woman will know.  Know what it is.  How to combat it.
He PULLS --

There's no tension against the ropes.
John FALLS back on his ass.

The ropes WHIZ through the rusty pulley overhead.
Pile on the floor in front of John. 
He lifts the end of the rope.  Stares:
BITTEN THROUGH.

							CUT TO:

THROUGH THE MONASTERY - SERIES OF SHOTS

John RUNS through the building.
Through the upper half of the planet.
DOWN through the many levels, past dozens of Monks oblivious to
the previous night's events and the danger they face:

Monks working at Looms.
Monks in the Tanning Room.
Monks in Morning Prayer.
Past them all, to --


INT. ABBEY BASEMENT WORKROOM - DAY

Mops and brooms.
John enters.  His hair is wild, breathing heavy.
He shoves the book into his medical bag.
Pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal a
WOODEN DOOR set into the timbers of the floor.
He opens the door:


LADDERS

Extending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level.
Past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters.
Beyond that - a great underground sea that marks the center of
the planet - below that, the cells.
And Ripley.


JOHN

Can smell the dank air from the lower tunnels.
He MUST go down -- The hard way.
He climbs into the darkness...


INT. ABBEY LAVATORY - NIGHT

An enormous room, over a football field in length, consisting
of at least a hundred open toilet STALLS facing a hundred wall
mounted SINKS.  Their condition, though, bespeaks the awful
truth -
The stalls furthest away from us are COBWEBBED.
Some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood.
Of the original hundred sinks, maybe twenty are still
functional - A facility created for a much larger number of
colonists than are left.

A SKINNY MONK washes his hands.


IN THE STALLS

Moving down the row of stalls (chest high, thank you) past a
few empty stalls and several grimacing faces, the second to
last being The Abbot --

			ABBOT
		Cold tonight --

-- continuing to the last, Bald Tribunal Member.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		Gets colder every night.

			ABBOT
		And every day.  Never this bad.  Taken
		so much wood out of the structure the
		surface wind blows right through the
		colony.  Right under the floor --

The Bald Tribunal Member SHIVERS as a cold breeze runs along the
waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl. 

			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		Right up your bloody backside.  Nights
		like this make me miss plumbing -- 
		Ack --!

He feels a TUGGING at his bowels - it's not piles. 
A beat.

			ABBOT O/S
		What?

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		I don't -- AAH --

The Bald Tribunal Monk SCREAMS as something GRABS him from
below --

(note: the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off.
I have completed the text to the best of my ability.)

Something SNAKES up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine!
He convulses in spasms of agony.

There is a terrible RIPPING SOUND as the Bald Tribunal Monk is 
PULLED VIOLENTLY down -- out of frame --

We PAN BACK down the row of stalls tight on each sitting Monk
and see their HORRIFIED REACTION as they feel the ALIEN drag the
Bald Tribunal Monk's body away under them...

THE ABBOT in his stall

He pounds on the wall --

			ABBOT
		Matthew?  Matthew?  Jesus, what's wrong?

SKINNY MONK washing his hands, sees all this.  Looses control
of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet --


OTHER MONKS

In their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore!  
Blood and viscera spraying the walls -- converting the Abbey
into an abattoir.

							CUT TO:
SPACE

Angle on the Orbitor Arceon:

An orb of wood hands peacefully against a tapestry of celestial
seas.

			RIPLEY V.O.
		Death...


INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - NIGHT

Darkness.  Somewhere water drips into a puddle.
Ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting
near the hole in the floor.  Her eyes are closed.

			RIPLEY
		Wherever I go.

A HAND pushes a crust of bread through the hole. 
She opens her eyes to look at the food.  The White-Haired Man's
head appears --

			WHITE-HAIRED MAN
		Take it.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony.

She knows his name.

			ANTHONY
		You waiting for meat?  They don't bring
		me meat because they know I'm an android.
		Really don't need it.  Bread's better
		for you anyway.  Harder to digest, so 
		it makes you feel fuller than you are.

			RIPLEY
		Not hungry.

Anthony takes a bite.

			ANTHONY
		Mmmm.  Just a little crunchy.

Ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the
ceiling.

			RIPLEY
		Waste of time.

			ANTHONY
		You don't eat, you'll starve to death,
		girl.

			RIPLEY
		That was the plan when they put me down
		here.  And why should you care?

			ANTHONY
		Because I'm a synthetic person you don't
		think I can care?

			RIPLEY
		Believe me, that's a discussion you don't
		want to have with me.

			ANTHONY
		You told me you had a bad experience and
		a good one with androids --

			RIPLEY
		That's one of each.  That means you could
		go either way.  I'm tired of talking about
		this.

He pushes the bread towards her again.

			ANTHONY
		You've still gotta eat.  You gotta fight
		the bastards --

			RIPLEY
		I'm tired of fighting.  Maybe I'll be
		dead before he finds me.  Maybe he won't
		get the satisfaction.

			ANTHONY
		He?  You make it sound like this Alien
		has a personal score to settle with you.
		The biology you describe:  Queen laying
		eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very
		insectoid.  Insects usually don't bear
		grudges.

			RIPLEY
		And Androids usually aren't the prisoners
		of lunatics that believe they're ancient 
		Greeks.

			ANTHONY
		Medieval Monks.

			RIPLEY
		Whatever.	

			ANTHONY
		And they've only chose to live the life
		style, they don't believe they're --
		     (hears something)
		What's that?

Ripley strains to listen.  In the distance:
KNOCKING.  Someone is knocking on the walls.
A VOICE calls out --


INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

			JOHN
		     (hoarse)
		Ripley!

He moves down the hallway.
BANGS his fist against the walls every few feet --
Waits a moment for a reply, then moves on.


INT. ANTHONY'S CELL

Anthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell:

The walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches -
Different versions of demons and the devil.  She rolls her eyes -
This guy is an Android!

Anthony crosses to his cell door, peers through eye level.


INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR HALLWAY - ANTHONY POV

John coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells.

			ANTHONY
		Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out --
		You're going to wake everybody up.

John moves to Anthony's door.  Looks at him through the slot.
Anthony recognizes him.

			ANTHONY
		Brother John?

John unbolts Anthony's door.
Picks him up by his cassock --

			JOHN
		Anthony?  Thought you dead fifteen years.

			ANTHONY
		Made too good for that.  What're
		you doing?

			JOHN
		I -- I'm looking -- the Abbot --

			ANTHONY
		What?  You look like you've seen the
		devil.

			RIPLEY O/S
		He has.

Anthony turns to look back at Ripley -- moves aside so John can 
see her face at the hole --

			ANTHONY 
		You mean he --

Anthony turns back - John is gone.

INT. THE CORRIDOR

As John begins to PULL the outermosk planks off.

			RIPLEY
		I was right, wasn't I?  You've seen it,
		you've seen the Alien?

John pauses at that.  
His eyes tighten at the memory.

			RIPLEY
		I can tell you have.  I was right.
		It came with me.
			(to the wall, sharp)
		Go away.

John stops.  Looks at the wall.
Ripley's voice comes clearly through the wood...

			RIPLEY
		Listen, priest, or whatever you are, I
		know what you want.  I can't help you.
		I couldn't help any of the others.  
		Just stop what you're doing.  Go away.
		Do you understand?

John has opened a crack that exposes Ripley's eyes.  
He stares at her a beat, tries to think of what to reply --
He goes back to work as she continues her confession...

			RIPLEY
		You going to stay, Father?  But you're 
		not going to talk.  Okay.  Then you can
		listen.  You should listen.  Your Abbot
		was right.  I am guilty.  But not of 
		heresy.  Of murder.

John stops again.
Just stares at her eyes.

			RIPLEY
		The murder of the crew of the Nostromo.
		That was when I first met the Alien.

That reminds him of why he's here.
He doubles his efforts at the boards...

			RIPLEY
		No, not the same one that's here now.
		Or maybe it is.  Maybe they're all the 
		same one.  I couldn't save my crew then.
		I should have been able to.  But I couldn't.
		When I went the second time --

Her eyes soften.

			RIPLEY
		Then I met Newt.  Newt.  I fought --
		stayed alive to keep Newt alive.
		Hoped maybe that would make up for...

She trails off.  Slides down the wall.

			RIPLEY
		Now he got her too.  What's the point?
		     (hard again)
		Just go away.  Leave me in here.  If you
		let me out you'll want me to help you
		and it will start all over again.
		Let it end.

John breaks through, flickering torch light streams in the mote
filled air around him.  Ripley looks up at him.

			RIPLEY
		I can't help you.

John, heaving and panting from the excertion.
Swallows...

			JOHN
		Puh. (pant) Please.

			RIPLEY
		It never ends.


INT. CORRIDOR - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

A long, twisted-plank-floored corridor with a torch every 
twenty feet.  There is MOVEMENT at the far end.  Something is
coming towards us - FLICKERING in and out of the light and 
shadow --

			RIPLEY O/S
		Sheep?

RIPLEY, JOHN AND ANTHONY

Running together.  Anthony carries a long wooden staff like a 
spear.  John has his bag.  Ripley a torch. 
We move with them.

			ANTHONY
		It must be able to take on some of the
		characteristics of the animal it grows in.
		Maybe they are from some sort of aggressive
		soldier race -- warring parties drop the
		eggs on opposing planets --

			RIPLEY
		And the alien takes on the form of the
		creature that finds it, assuming that
		animal is the dominant life form on the
		planet.  So when it gestates in a man --

Ripley shudders at the memory.

			ANTHONY
		It's a biped.  In a sheep or cow, a quadroped.

			RIPLEY
		Shit.  I just didn't think it could do that
		to animals.

			JOHN
		Wait a minute - I thought you were the
		expert on this monster.

			RIPLEY
		Is that the only reason you came to get
		me out?  Because I knew about this thing?

			JOHN
		Yes.  I mean no.  I mean, that was part of
		it.  Look.  I never thought you were wrong.
		I was wrong not to say anything.  I was
		afraid to speak up.  It's hard to be a 
		monk, you know?

Ripley stops.  Looks at him.
A long beat.

			RIPLEY
		Thank you.  If anything, you're honest.

			JOHN
		We all are.  Took vows.

			RIPLEY
		I don't know about the Abbot.

			JOHN
		I'm sure he thinks what he did was right.

			RIPLEY
		Is that speaking up for someone?

			JOHN
		No.  Charity.

She smiles.  They turn a corner...


INT. SLOPING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

This hallway slopes downwards a few degrees.  The three find 
themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance.

			RIPLEY
		All right, let's forget about the past
		and get on to our survival.  No more
		prisoners behind us?

			ANTHONY
		Not for years.

			RIPLEY
		Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days
		to lay his eggs our only hope is to get
		off this - What is this?

			JOHN
		Arceon.

			ANTHONY
		Satellite.

			RIPLEY
		Get to my ship and get off this Satellite.

			JOHN
		We can't.

			RIPLEY
		We can't what?

			JOHN
		Leave Arceon.  Can't leave the library --

			RIPLEY
		A Tape Library?

			JOHN
		Books.

			RIPLEY
		So?

			JOHN
		The reason we are out here.  Like the
		Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries 
		on remote islands off England during
		the First Plague --

			RIPLEY
		There must be books on other colonies --

			JOHN
		Some of these books survived the burning
		of the Libraries of Alexandria.  They
		contain knowledge that exists in no 
		other record.  Their value is unestimable.

He runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag.

			JOHN
		We're supposed to protect them.

			RIPLEY
		    (to Anthony)
		And what does an android have to do 
		with all this?

			JOHN
		He's a spy.

			ANTHONY
		The Company planted me here.

			RIPLEY
		The Company?  What does the Company have
		to do with this?

			ANTHONY
		They built this prison.

			RIPLEY
		Prison?

			JOHN
		Colony.

			ANTHONY
		Prison.  They are all political heretics.  

Ripley looks at John.

			RIPLEY
		You left that part out.

			JOHN
		The order was more of a counter culture,
		a reaction to the Technology that was
		beginning to take over everyone's lives.
		It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't 
		watch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons
		into the air.  The earliest members
		renounced technology.  Started to collect
		the remaining books.  Nobody would have
		noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus.

			RIPLEY
		Your Abbot talked about that.  The
		New Plague.

			ANTHONY
		A computer virus.  A bad program.  By
		this time the Corporate structure was
		transglobal, all the world's data storage
		systems were linked.  It spread through
		two countries before it was stopped.

			JOHN
		After a scare like that, thousands flocked
		to our retreat.  People started clamoring
		for written information.  For our books.
		They abandoned the modern ways --

			RIPLEY
		I think I can see how this comes out.	
		They gave up their possessions.

			ANTHONY
		This was a threat --

			RIPLEY
		To the Company.

			JOHN
		They sold the technology.  A movement 
		to live simply was quickly twisted by 
		Federal agents into a political movement
		against the Company-controlled World
		Government.  Too much was at stake.

			RIPLEY
		Too much profit.

			JOHN
		We were sentenced as political dissidents.
		This orbiter is our gulag.  All the men
		were packed up with all our books, and
		towed into space.  Ten thousand men.  The
		eldest died very quickly.

			RIPLEY
		The Company had such a sense of irony.  
		Sending you out on this wooden tub.

			ANTHONY
		I was placed among them as a sensor.
		Keeps tabs on the movement.

			RIPLEY
		So how'd they find out about you?

			ANTHONY
		I told them.  After the supply ship's
		stopped coming I saw no point in keeping
		up the charade.  Since I was a sort of
		walking reminder of technology, they cast
		me down.

			RIPLEY
		Join the club.
		     (to John)
		I figured this wasn't planned.  You don't
		have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be
		prudent to try to preserve man's written
		works for generations -- without women.

John looks embarrassed.

			RIPLEY
		And I don't know about your New Plague,
		but I was just on Earth and everything's 
		fine.

John has a doubtful look.

			RIPLEY
		I was right about the Alien, wasn't I?
		Means I must be right about the Earth.

The logic behind her argument is uncomfortable.

			JOHN
		     (beat)
		Perhaps.

			RIPLEY
		That's better than nothing.  Come on.

They reach the end of the corridor.
It opens into --


INT. TRANSOM SPACE - PRISON LEVEL

An enormous open space between "cell blocks."
The Wall behind them is honey-combed with corridor openings
going up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladders
reminiscent of Indian cave dwellings.  Only wooden.

The room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them
-- falling off into gloom.

They stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the room
and the task ahead of them.  Finally --


			RIPLEY
		At any rate, let's forget about the
		Earth completely - whether you're right
		or I'm right what's important is getting
		the hell out of here.  From here my ship
		is...?

John points up at the ceiling.

			ANTHONY
		In Heaven.

			RIPLEY
		Right.  And this is...

Anthony and John nod.

			ANTHONY
		This orbiter was patterned after a 
		medieval concept of the universe --
			 (makes a circle in the air)
		They call the top half "Heaven - "

			JOHN
		The Abbey, the fields --

			ANTHONY
		The bottom half is "Hell."  Where we are.

			RIPLEY
		Aptly named.  What's in the middle?

			JOHN
		The sea.

			ANTHONY
		Really.

			RIPLEY
		Work with me here.  How far is it back
		to the surface of the planet?

			JOHN
		As a stone falls --- Five miles through
		the center.

			RIPLEY
		And the elevator -- the thing they
		lowered me down in?

			JOHN	
		Ropes cut.

			ANTHONY
		It's smart.  First he cuts their escape
		off, then works his way down through the 
		monastery level by level until there
		isn't a thing left alive.  Interesting...

			RIPLEY
		Well, you start appreciating him more
		than me and I'll find a way to shut
		you down, capisce, Andy?  How do we
		get up?

			JOHN
		There are ladders.

She stops.  John and Anthony continue on a few steps and then
stop and walk back to her.

			RIPLEY
		Five miles with the Alien between us
		and there?  Good luck, boys.

She turns and heads back towards her cell --
John catches her shoulder --

			JOHN
		You can't --

			RIPLEY
		Can't what?  Not help you go to your
		deaths?  I've had my fill of that.

			JOHN
		I need you.  I can't do it alone.

			RIPLEY
		I've fought these creatures twice
		before.  It take a lot to kill
		these things.  Heavy artillery.

			ANTHONY
		We don't have weapons here.

			RIPLEY
		How about something we can make weapons
		from?  Do you have anything like that --
		any modern things here?

John SHAKES his head vehemently --

			JOHN
		We renounced technology.  It was those
		things that caused the Plague.

			RIPLEY
		This is a man-made planet.  Something has
		to be recirculating your air, your water.

			JOHN
		God?

			RIPLEY
		Please.

			JOHN
		I don't know.  I just took it for granted.

			RIPLEY
		Most people do.  Without some sort of
		technology we haven't got a chance.

From behind them:

			ANTHONY
		There is technology.

John and Ripley turn to look at him.

			ANTHONY
		A room.  A Technology room.  Fresh air
		and water come out.

			RIPLEY
		An atmosphere processing plant --

			ANTHONY
		The heart and lungs of Arceon.

			RIPLEY
		Where is it?

			ANTHONY
		One level beneath the underground sea.

			JOHN
		That's five levels up --

			ANTHONY
		     (points into the gloom)
		On the other side of the orbiter.

John looks at Ripley --

			JOHN
		A chance.

Ripley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back.

			RIPLEY
		All right.  You've got me - so far.
		But here's the deal:  I don't know
		how many of your brethren are going
		to be alive when we get up there,
		but if we make it to my ship, you're
		all coming with me.  We'll take as
		many of your precious books as we
		can carry, but we're going.  I'm not
		going to fight this thing again to 
		end up alone again.  Understand?

John nods his head.

			RIPLEY
		We're all dead anyway.  We might as
		well go fi --

She feels a TWINGE in her midsection --
Doubles over.  Anthony and John each take an arm --

			RIPLEY
		Ugh - I'm all right.

She takes a deep breath.

			RIPLEY
		Still thawing out.  I hate hyper sleep...
		Come on.

							CUT TO:


INT. ARCEON - MONASTERY LEVEL - NIGHT

The formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched
battlefield.  Wooden huts leveled.  Small fires dot the land.
The air thick with ash and greasy smoke.

DOZENS OF MONKS swarm across the countryside like ants on a 
mound of spilt sugar.  In one hand a taper or torch held high,
in the other hand their WEAPON: scythe, pitchfork, hoe,
whatever they could get ahold of, seem pitifully out of place.
Some pound sharpened stakes into the ground, others push carts
into rough barricades.

A "Platoon" of Monks huddle around trap doors open on the
wooden "ground."  More ladders.
They climb down to --


AN UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT

Just beneath the Monastery level of the satellite: an 
Underground Wheatfield.  Tall golden grass stretches out for
miles, swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support
the Abbey fifty feet above --

THE CEILING

A lattice-work of suspended troughs and wooden pipes --
the "plumbing," the understructure, of the Monastery.


THE MONKS

Descend the ladders single file.  Fear is in all of their faces
though most have only heard the stories.  They move cautiously
into the wheat.  Spread out through the field in the jaggedly
drawn skirmish line.


THE ABBOT

The Bald Tribunal Monk's dried blood splattered on his cassock,
stands atop an empty wooden wagon.  From this vantage point he
watches


THE MONKS IN THE FIELD

THRASH and POKE their way forward leaving trails through the
high grass.  Their attempt at an orderly progression quickly
falls apart as they get strung out all over the field.

			ABBOT
		     (sotto)
		Stay together.  Together...

Then another movement catches the Abbot's eye --
AHEAD of the Monks - the wheat waves against the wind.
Begins to ripple -- the wheat flattens.
a TRAIL forms.
SomeTHING is MOVING in the long grass.
Moving towards the Lead Monk -- FAST.

The Abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning - even
though the Monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to
hear him - before he can make a sound The Alien closes the gap -
Feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as

AARGH-Aa -!
The Lead Monk gives one strangled CRY before he disappears
beneath the surface of the long grass.  His taper falls
among the long, dry stalks -- begins to SMOKE...

The Abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they
can.  He finds his voice:

			ABBOT
		Run!  RUN!

The Monks in the field turn from the spot where the Monk
screamed towards the Abbot -- TURN THEIR BACKS to the now
moving again trail --

			ABBOT
		No - NO.  The --

The Alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle --
RAKING through five Monks like a scythe through wheat.
His tail, arms WHIP out --
SNAP their spines like kindling.
Lost torches ignite the wheat...

The field BURSTS INTO FLAME.
Smoke fills the air.

In the smoky commotion the Monks break rank and start running.
Weapons in front of them -- SWINGING wildly --
Screaming.  Crying.  DYING.

One Frightened Monk runs through another with his pitchfork.
Another hears something crashing through the grass towards
him and buries his scythe in his best friend's chest.

And through it all the Alien seems to be everywhere.
Using the chalky smoke for cover as it SLASHES and TEARS its way
across the field --


THE ABBOT

Frozen in terror to the spot.   Squints through the smoke to see
what has happened to his flock.  Hears the WAILS of defeat
rising up from the wounded.

The waving grass is flattened as The Alien moves towards him --

He can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon.
He climbs down.  As his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a
shadow fall over him.  The little hairs on the back of his neck
stand up.  He slowly turns...

THE ALIEN

Rises out of the grass in front of the Holy Man.
Slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters.
It's long, smooth head is no longer black and slimy.

It is golden.
It's cable-like arms are sheathed in a straw-like covering.
It has adapted to the environment of the wheat field.  Its now
grass-like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile.

The Abbot SCREAMS and RUNS.


			JOHN O/S
		It isn't your fault, you know.


INT. TRANSOM SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS

They move across the huge room...Anthony a few paces ahead.
Their candles throwing only enough light to see several yards.
Wind whistles through the huge room, timbers creaking like some
gigantic old house settling.

			RIPLEY
		What?

			JOHN
		Those things you said before --

Ripley remembers her "confession."

			JOHN
		I read about it in psychology books.
		Sometimes when people outlive someone
		they cared for, they transfer some of
		the guilt for that person's death to
		themselves.

			RIPLEY
		I got a belly full of that from the
		Psychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah.
		"Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something
		like that.  But that's not what I was
		thinking about.  I was thinking about
		my "friend" up there.

She looks up.

			RIPLEY
		He was on the pod.  He killed Newt but
		not me.  Why not me?  It's almost like
		he's playing with me.  Maybe they have
		some sort of race memory.  Maybe he
		knows what I did to his "mother."
		That's why he didn't just kill me.
		That would be too easy.  He has to
		torment me.

			JOHN
		You make it sound human.

			RIPLEY
		Hell, I don't know what it is.

John unconsiously fingers his book.

			JOHN
		I think I do.


INT. LADDER-WELL - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

At the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to 
another block of cell corridors four stories up.
Years of damp air have warped the ladder.
Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand.
They climb...


INT. END OF PRISON CORRIDOR - FOURTH LEVEL - NIGHT

Dark.  Ripley is the first one up.
She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone.
The cells here have no doors.
She holds her torch in one --
An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation.


AT THE LADDER

John is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him.  
Anthony is winded.  He reaches up for a helping hand.
John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without
them, then reaches down to help Anthony.
Their hands clasp --


ANTHONY HAS A "VISION"

He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing
peacefully at his side.
SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons.

Fish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons.
They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs.
The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of
razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE --

Anthony SCREAMS -!


RIPLEY

Down the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony
fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp -


ANTHONY

Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real 
world as he fights against the demons in his android mind --
He JERKS --
Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP --
OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him...


JOHN

Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand.
It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft --

			JOHN
		Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -!

He PULLS with all his might...


ANTHONY

SEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak --
BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air --
He aims for its head:
CRACK -!
WHACKS John's hand with his staff --

John HOWLS in pain - LETS GO --

Anthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air --

Ripley's hands SHOOT OUT --
GRAB Anthony's cassock --
STOP his fall.

Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror --
A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched
itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head.
Ripley has become the Alien.

WHACK!
Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff --
HITS Ripley on the head.
WHACK!
Again.  In the face.

John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm --
WHACK!
The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back.
Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock --
Opens her mouth - GRUNTS --

ANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him.

WHACK! 
His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose.
She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance --
Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony --

JOHN GRABS THEM!

Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo
wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them
into the corridor -- WHUMPH!

They land on the floor in a heap.
Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT --

Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them.
Finally, the vision leaves him.
He loses consciousness.


JOHN

Breathing heavy - opens his eyes --
He's staring right into Ripley's face.
Less than an inch away.
He's laying on top of her.
She's breathing heavy too.
A long, uncomfortable moment.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks.

			JOHN
		You're welcome.

They roll off each other.
Her hand goes up to her nose.
Blood.

			RIPLEY
		I'm all right.

John reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag.

			JOHN
		Hold this against your nose.  It'll
		stop the flow.

She looks over at him questioningly.

			JOHN
		I'm a doctor.

She holds the small bag against her nose.  The bleeding stops.
They move over to Anthony - try to help him to his feet.
He shakes them off.

			ANTHONY
		No - please.  Just let me sit.
		Awhile.

He rubs his temples.  White, milk-like sweat runs down his
cheek.

			ANTHONY
		Damn it.

			RIPLEY
		What was that?

			ANTHONY
		The reason I'm down here.

John points to his own eyes.

			JOHN
		Visions.

			ANTHONY
		Dreams.

			RIPLEY
		Androids can't dream...

			ANTHONY
		That's probably what they thought when
		they built me.  But my brain is cyber-
		organic - patterned after the human
		brain - it functions the same way a
		human brain does.  It accumulates random
		images and sensations during waking 
		hours, but unlike the human brain that
		sloughs them off during sleep --

			RIPLEY
		Androids don't sleep.

			ANTHONY
		Right.  Maybe they've fixed this on later
		models, but I don't.  Do you know what 
		happens to the human brain when it is
		deprived of sleep?  It starts to run off
		the dreams while you're awake, as 
		hallucinations.  Same thing with me.
		For twenty years I absorbed data on this
		planetoid.  A little after we lost contact
		with Earth the visions started.  They
		thought I was insane.  I had to explain 
		that it was because I was an android.
		They liked that even less.

			RIPLEY
		What did you see?

			ANTHONY
		What I always see.  Images of Monsters.
		Demons.

			JOHN
		They're portents.  They stand for an
		evil yet to come.

			ANTHONY
		Just images I've absorbed from those old
		books and have no way to get rid of.

			RIPLEY
		I saw the inside of your cell.

			ANTHONY
		     (shrugs)
		My head is full of them.  I try to get
		them out any way I can.

His eyelids droop.

			JOHN
		You need sleep.

			ANTHONY
		I know that.  I'll settle for rest.

He closes his eyes.  Ripley recovers the torch.

			RIPLEY
		Stay with him.

Ripley tried to stand - John takes her arm, pulls her down.

			JOHN
		No.  We all need rest.  You especially.

Ripley considers him.

			JOHN
		Doctor's orders.

She smiles and sits.

			JOHN
		Besides, you see what happens when you
		get ahead of us.  We should stay together.

			RIPLEY
		All right.  He's still above us, anyway.

			JOHN
		What do you mean?

			RIPLEY
		I've faced this evil twice before - I
		guess I've gotten sensitive to it --
		     (beat)
		You're really a Doctor?

John pats his canvas bag.

			JOHN
		See my bag?

			RIPLEY
		What's that book?

			JOHN
		Just a book.

			RIPLEY
		I don't buy "just a book" from a guy who
		says we can't leave the planet without
		the library.
			
			JOHN
		It's just... a medical book I might need.

			RIPLEY
		You don't have any food in there, do you?

			JOHN
		Only if you can eat bandages.

Ripley rubs her midsection.

			RIPLEY
		In a few hours that's going to sound
		good.  Going in and out of suspended
		animation - Christ I probably haven't
		eaten in a year.

			ANTHONY
		    (without opening eyes)
		You should've eaten the bread.

			RIPLEY AND JOHN
		Rest!

Ripley lets her head loll back against the wall.
Closes her eyes.  Time passes.
Her brow knits.
John sees this.

			JOHN
		You all right?

			RIPLEY
		Aces.

			JOHN
		You weren't hurt when I landed on you?
		Bruised a rib?

He reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock.
Feels her midsection.  His hands are warm.

			RIPLEY
		Are you sure you're a doctor?

He withdraws his hands.

			JOHN
		Sort of.  My father passed on when we 
		first came here.  The Abbey's Physician -
		Father Anselm - took me in.  He really
		raised me --
			  (pause)
		Taught me what he could before he
		passed away.  He was schooled on Earth.

			RIPLEY
		Well, I'm just hungry.

			JOHN
		You haven't eaten since I took you
		out of your tube.

			RIPLEY
		You did that...

She reaches out and takes hold of his hands.  Turns them over.

			RIPLEY
		You burned yourself on the escape pod.

Her hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable.

			RIPLEY
		Thank you, I guess.

They look into each other's eyes --

			ANTHONY O/S
		You should've eaten the bread.

Ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands.
Looks at Anthony.  He's trying to stand.

			ANTHONY
		Enough rest.  There's beasties afoot.

They start into...


A NARROW CORRIDOR

Ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them.
Ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks.


INT. LADDER SHAFT

A great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere.
Seems at least a mile long.
The group climbs...


A SERPENTINE CORRIDOR

Liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head.
Falls into RED puddles on the slanted floor.

John kneels, dips his fingertips --

			JOHN
		Blood.
		     (sniffs)
		Mixed with sea water.

			ANTHONY
		We're getting close to the center of
		the arc -- near the sea.

			RIPLEY
		Blood.

			JOHN
		Getting close...

John HEARS somthing.
Raises his hand -- "stop"
The group stops.  Flatten themselves against the wall.

John takes Anthony's staff.
Moves forward with it held out in front of him...
WHIRLS around a blind corner --
SHOVES something against the wall --
Thump!
It struggles --

Ripley and Anthony run up -- raise their tapers --
Revealing:

			RIPLEY
		The Abbot.

Cassock torn, dirty.  Hair, eyes wild.
Anthony's staff across his throat. 
John pulls back.

			JOHN
		Father --

			RIPLEY
		   (sarcastic)
		What are you doing down here, father?
		You look like you've seen something
		that doesn't exist.

The Abbot runs his fingers through his hair.  Smoothes it down.

			ABBOT
		I was their spiritual leader.  I was not
		prepared to lead them in battle.
		Not against that thing.

			JOHN
		No one could be.

			RIPLEY
		I thought you said the evil was inside
		me -- that sealing me up was the answer
		to all your problems?

			ABBOT
		Destruction.  The destruction YOU brought
		to us!

			RIPLEY
		I only tried to warn you.

			ABBOT
		What are you doing with this woman --?

			JOHN
		We are going to the Technology Room.
		Trying to find some way to fight --

			ABBOT
		You don't join the devil to fight the
		devil.

			ANTHONY
		She's helping us --

			ABBOT
		Look who defends the deceiver -- the one
		who isn't even human.  John, can't you see
		what is happening?  On ancient Earth,
		during the Black Death - many believed
		that God had abandoned them, so they
		appealed to the Devil.  Flocked to him
		hoping to save their bodies - losing their
		souls in the bargain.

			RIPLEY
		Father, we're all on the run from the 
		same monster so let's not resort to the
		fire and brimstone routine.  I've been
		enlightened about your "movement."
		Pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a
		planet of heretics.

			JOHN
		Please. 

The time for pretense is past.

			ABBOT
		All right.  I was trying to keep you quiet. 

			JOHN
		Sir --?

			ABBOT
		I do what I have to do to keep the
		Brotherhood together.  We all gave up
		believing in Earth a long time ago.  How
		do you think they would feel if told
		their exiled was in vain?  That the
		holocaust they were trying to avoid
		never occured?  Those men up there have
		grown to live with it.

			RIPLEY
		And with you as their leader.

The Abbot smiles.  Ripley is sharp.

			ABBOT
		You threatened the status quo.

			RIPLEY
		So you, protector of knowledge and truth,
		lied to them.

			ABBOT
		Only about you.  The rest I still
		believe.  If Earth still orbits its sun
		there is no way it could have survived
		being reduced to Barbarism.

			RIPLEY
		You're as bad as the Company.

			JOHN
		Ripley --

			RIPLEY
		That's why you ran.  After all your talk
		death stared you in the face and you
		were afraid.

			ABBOT
		Not afraid of death.

			RIPLEY
		The Alien.

			ANTHONY
		The Organism.

			ABBOT
		The Devil.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM CORRIDOR

The now four refugees work their way into the final corridor.
Dark.  Turns at sharp angles.  Blind alleys.
The floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted.
Warped by years of water dripping from above.
The group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candles
held high...


ANTHONY

Bringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down --
SNAPP!!!
Everybody stops at the sound.

			ABBOT
		What was that?

Anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a--

			ANTHONY
		Man trap.

They lower their candles.  Look to:

THE FLOOR

Interspersed throughout the timbers --
Spring jawed, steel toothed, BEAR TRAPS.
Rusted.  Open.  And all around them.

			ANTHONY
		In case anyone tried to get in and
		tamper with the technology.

The four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field of
man traps.  Nobody moves.

			ABBOT
		What do we do?

			RIPLEY
		Don't move.  Don't breath.

			ABBOT
		We can't just stand here and wait.

			RIPLEY
		Floor's too unstable to try to walk
		around them.

John pulls a loose board from the corridor wall.
Turns and kneels at the trap in front of him.
Pokes the end of the board into the jaws...
SNAP!!

The others jump at the sound --

			ABBOT
		John - what are you doing?

John pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws.
Moves to the next trap --
Snap!!

			RIPLEY
		He's thinking like a leader.  Everyone:
		Grab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path.
		      (proud of him)
		Good work, Father John.

			JOHN
		Brother.

			RIPLEY
		Brother.  Let's go.

Ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her.  
Exposes a bit of the surface underneath --
It's METAL.

She touches the cool, familiar material.  Smiles.
Now she knows this is not a dream.
She turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her --
SNAP!!


THE FOUR

Slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a
candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in
front of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP.
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps....


THE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROOM

A huge wooden door with no knob or handle.  Looks like it could
almost be part of the wall.  John and Ripley are the first to
it.  They put down their planks and begin to feel around the
edges of the door for some purchase.
The Abbot joins them.


BACK IN THE CORRIDOR

Anthony lags behind.  He senses a presence in the hallway.
Hears a sound behind him.
We see a GLIMPSE of something --
He turns towards the sound --

Empty hallway.

He thinks.  Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the
rear... SNAP!


AT THE DOOR

Ripley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls.
Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and
exhaustion.  To get this far, and be locked out.
She feels sick to her stomach.
How long since she had food?
She looks over at John.
He is staring at her.
He turns red at being caught.  Cute.

			JOHN
		I just - are you allright?

			RIPLEY
		Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just
		feel my age.
		       (smiles)
		Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a
		hundred.

She wipes her brow and goes back to knocking...

			JOHN
		Hello?

The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow.
Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull --
The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons.


BEHIND THE PLANK

A primitive KEYBOARD.  Circa late twentieth century.

			JOHN
		I think this is it.

Ripley and the Abbot move over to see.

			ABBOT
		Technology.

			RIPLEY
		Yeah - a hundred years ago.  An antique.

			ABBOT
		     (to Ripley)
		Go ahead.

			RIPLEY
		Go ahead and what?

			ABBOT
		Open the door, woman.

			RIPLEY
		I'll get to it, but listen to me --
		you may dress like you're living in
		the middle ages but you can't treat
		me like your chambermaid, or whatever
		Monks had.


UP THE HALL - ANTHONY

Hears the sound again.  Turns.
Nothing again.
He pauses... Turns back quickly --

The wooden wall MOVES - steps forward --


THE ALIEN

Adapted itself to look like WOOD.

It's body changes -- transmutes -- Cable-like sinew snaking
over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio-
mechnoid alien appearance...!


ANTHONY POV

The weary android sees the Alien as a conglommoration of his
many Medieval images of demons.  He hears the Alien's hollow,
raspy breath.  It glides towards him...

Anthony steps back directly INTO A TRAP as his mind goes --
SNAP!!
The STEEL JAWS spring shut on his left ankle.
Milky blood-fluid starts to flow.

He finds himself in the same predicament as his vision --
Ankle pinned, the Alien's appendages circling him --
He screams.  AAAAAAAAAAAARGH --!


AT THE DOOR

Ripley is trying to work.  She punches numbers into the keyboard.
She is too exhausted to see straight.
They HEAR the scream --
John RUNS back --
Traps SNAPPING around him --
Ripley turns towards the sound --
The Abbot pushes her back to the keyboard --

			ABBOT
		OPEN IT!!

Ripley knits her brows.  Forces herself to focus.
Her fingers punch the keys.


THE ALIEN

Steps towards Anthony --
Snap-snap-SNAP-AP-!!
Traps snap closed on its tail, its legs --


HALFWAY DOWN THE HALL - JOHN

SNAP!!
His cassock is snagged in a trap.
He TEARS right out of it --
AT THE END OF THE HALL

Anthony is in the clutches of the Alien.
He WHACKS at the Beast with his staff, but his blows fall like
drops of rain on an elephant.

The Alien LIFTS him up to face him.  Anthony SCREAMS as his left
leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the trap's chain --
Blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle.


FACE TO FACE WITH THE ALIEN

Anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the alien's arms with
his own android arms.  His extra-human strength keeps them from
squeezing him any tighter, but he cannot avert his gaze from
the smooth, eyeless face.

The Alien considers him.  Its thin, almost translucent lips pull
back to reveal rows of splinter-like teeth.  The jaws spread,
making room for the distended tongue:

The Alien HISSES --
PUTS OUT Anthony's EYES with a thin stream of ACIDIC SALIVA --
Artificial skin BUBBLES AND BLISTERS --


JOHN

Picks up Anthony's staff.
Begins to FLAIL away at the demon.


AT THE DOOR

Ripley is getting no response from the keyboard.

			ABBOT
		What's wrong?!

Ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment.
The wires are so old they've broken.

			RIPLEY
		Shit.

She BITES the ends off the wires - spits out the insulation.
TWISTS the bare wire ends together...
Sweat runs into her eyes.


JOHN

WHACKS the Alien with Anthony's staff --
Again.  Again.  The creature will not let Anthony go.
The Android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered,
pulpy mass, eyes gone.


RIPLEY

Finishes hot wiring.  The keyboard hums to life.
Her fingers FLY across the keys --


THE ALIEN

Tail wraps around John's waist --
Pulls him towards it --
LIFTS him - turns him upside down --

Lips PULL BACK --

John's hands GROPE at the floor --

Sharp metal teeth SPREAD --


THE DOOR KEYBOARD

Lights:  CODE ACCEPTED
Ripley's head whips towards the corridor --


JOHN

His hand closes around the end of one of the traps --
He brings it up --
SNAP!!
It SLAMS closed on the Alien's extended Tongue -!
The Beast bellows!!
Whips its head from side to side --
Can't shake off the trap --
ACID BLOOD sprays out --!
Lands as pools of FIRE on the wooden floor.


THE DOOR

Opens with a strained blast of dust -- SEE-WHORCSSH!
The Abbot LEAPS inside --

			RIPLEY
		It's open!!


JOHN

PRIES Anthony's ankle out of his trap.
Scoops up his staff, drags the moaning Android --
Back up the corridor --


RIPLEY

Stands in open Technology Room doorway --

			ABBOT
		Close it -- close it -- it's coming -

			RIPLEY
		We wait.  John!!

John and Anthony appear out of the shadows --
Run/hobble towards the door --


THE ALIEN

Acid Blood DISSOLVES the traps' steel jaws.  PULLS itself free.
Head whips towards the escaping Monks -- if it had eyes they
would narrow to slits in anger --
RUNS up the hall --


RIPLEY

Follows John and Anthony into the Technology Room.
On the other side of the doorway: another keyboard.
She punches keys --

			ABBOT
		Hurry --

			JOHN
		HURRY!!


THE ALIEN

Yards away -- Limping.  Hissing.
ANGRY.


THE KEYBOARD

Acceptance tone "bings."
The Door starts to slide down --

The Alien is feet away --
INCHES...

The door seats itself closed with a solid THUD.

Ripley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden
door.  A beat.
She turns to the room for the first time and finds --


WINDMILLS

Real Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills.  Two story high
arms slowly rotating.  Moving enormous volumes of air through
the wind tunnel-like room.  As far as the eye can see.
Turning, creaking.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
But no electronics.  No radio.  No weapons.
This is the Technology Room.

Ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness.  

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SULACO ESCAPE SHIP #4 (DREAM)

Yellow warning lights PULSE.  Those goddamned STROBES are
flickering on and off.  Steam blasts out overhead pipes.

The blue-spark pilot light muzzles of a FLAME THROWER shyly
pokes out from behind a console.  It's owner cautiously
follows...


RIPLEY

She's breathing heavy.
She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top.
Her eyes flit from side to side.  Then up.  Then down.
She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod.
She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube:


IN THE TUBE

Newt sleeps peacefully.
Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers.
Her grip TIGHTENS in the Flame Thrower in her hands.
She flips a switch to HI HEAT.
Moves around the sleep tubes...

A noise to her left.
She WHIRLS --

Pulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click.  Nothing.
She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame.
She begins to panic --

Senses the Alien's presence.
Looks left, right, up - no Alien...
Looks down:

The Alien's tail is COMING UP BETWEEN HER LEGS.
She turns --

Right into it's grasp.
The useless flamethrower SKITTERS across the floor.
She PUMMELS the beast with balled up fists.

			RIPLEY
		No.  NO!  I beat you!  I beat you mother
		fucker!!

The Alien spins her -- pushes her over across the sleep tube --
Like it's taking her from behind!

Ripley looks down into the sleep tube:

Newt is gone.
Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood.
The Alien wraps his arms around Ripley.
Thin lips pull back for a kiss.

She SCREAMS.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - REALITY - DAY

Ripley opens her eyes.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
She's still in the room with the windmills.
Somehow this place seems less real than her dream.
She looks around:

John is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment.
He smiles a relieved smile.

			JOHN
		I thought we'd lost you.

			RIPLEY
		What are you writing?

			JOHN
		Last will and testament.
		      (beat)
		Just kidding.

She looks to her left:
Anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his
eyes.  His ankle is a swollen mess.  Wires are hanging out.

			RIPLEY
		Is he --?

			JOHN
		Resting.
		      (shakes his head)
		He'll be fine.

			ANTHONY
		No I won't.  He's a terrible liar.

			RIPLEY
		I'm sorry.

			ANTHONY
		It's ironic.  I guess my visions were
		prescience after all.  How will I ever
		resolve that with my artifical con-
		science?

A creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention to
The Abbot.  He's pacing.

			ABBOT
		Do you see what you've delivered us
		into?

			RIPLEY
		Yeah.  Lead me not into temptation to
		kick your -- ahh --

Ripley tries to stand - her head spins.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		Oh shit.

The entire room THROBS with the rhythm of the wind.

			RIPLEY
		Where is the Big Boy -?

The Abbot points to the door.

			ABBOT
		On the other side of that door.
		Waiting for us to starve to death.

Ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface.

			RIPLEY
		It's playing with us.  It could get in
		here any time it wants.

			ABBOT
		Why should he enter?  He knows that one
		of the people in this room is in league
		with him.

			JOHN
		Sir.  We're all in the same coracle, so
		to speak.

			ABBOT
		Maybe more than one of us.

			RIPLEY
		Let's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot.

She looks at the windmills.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		This is your technology?

			ABBOT
		Even this is forbidden to us.

			RIPLEY
		Well then, the facts are that we're screwed.

She moves into the room.  Walks around one of the Windmills.

			RIPLEY
		An Eco system.  Nothing to recycle your
		atmosphere except the green plants.  Winds
		generated down here --
		     (looks at the floor)
		Windmills use the natural surface winds
		to turn wheels underground, create tides
		on the seas to recirculate your water...

			ANTHONY
		More than that.  There are pumps beneath
		the floor - I can feel their vibration.

			RIPLEY
		Probably pumping this air through charcoal
		filters.

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		It gets colder all the time here, right?

John looks at her questioningly.

			JOHN
		Yes...

			RIPLEY
		Your wood burning fires throw soot into
		the atmosphere, building the cloud layer -
		cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the
		planet, forcing you to burn more wood.

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			ANTHONY
		The Greenhouse Effect.  It's how the Earth
		almost destroyed itself in the late 20th
		century.

			RIPLEY
		Don't you see?  This is a planet set to
		self destruct.  Not in ten minutes or two
		hours but soon.  Your atmosphere here is
		finite.  If the plants die the fires will
		eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid
		will be dead - Everyone will die.

The Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last 
few meters of a Marathon.

			ABBOT
		It's here.  I was just hoping I would be
		dead long before it came to this.

			JOHN
		What?

			ABBOT
		We're supposed to die here.  That's the point.

			RIPLEY
		Wait a minute -- you were exiled --?

			ABBOT
		The punishment for our crime was death.

Anthony sits up.

			ANTHONY
		This planet is the supreme triumph of
		planned obsolesence.  A certain amount of
		primitive materials with an atmosphere
		processing system as fragile as a real
		environment but not replenishable.

The Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes...

			ABBOT
		Poetic justice for the anti-technologists.
		The Company's best work.  You know, I used
		to be a corporate executive.  Middle range
		V.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft.
		I chucked it all and joined the order.
		Be a monk -- see the world.  Being here,
		being chairman of the board...

			RIPLEY
		No, now I understand why I landed here.
		To join you happy lunatics in your 
		deaths.

Ripley moves away...
John starts after her.

			JOHN
		Ripley, wait --

The Abbot stands, blocks his way.

			ABBOT
		Where can she go?  She's trapped.
		       (beat)
		Trapped inside her own prison.  A prison
		in her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing.
		Sparklets of light - dance with the june
		bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare
		coming to danceintheshadowof...

John and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot.
He begins to speak faster.  Faster.
He shakes.  Vibrates is more accurate --
A trickle of BLOOD runs from his left ear...

			ABBOT

SPLORTCH-KT--!!
The Abbot's HEAD EXPLODES --!!!
Like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement.
Blood, bone, hair and brain matter SPRAY John.
John SCREAMS.


A HORRIBLE ALIEN HEAD BURSTER

Is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the Abbot.
It keeps it's hold on the Abbot's spinal cord -- The Abbot's
body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as
lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way
through the system.

Ripley SCREAMS.
The Infant Alien-headed corpse stumbles towards her --
She plucks Anthony's staff from the floor and SWINGS --
-- Like a child hitting a baseball from a TEE --
WHACK-K -!!
BLASTS the Chest/head burster across the room --

It hits the floor SCRAMBLING.  Scuttles down into where the
Windmills meet the floor.  Disappears.

			RIPLEY
		BASTARD!!  It came out of his fucking
		head!

			ANTHONY
		I didn't have to see that to know what
		that means.

			RIPLEY
		He sent him to us.  That bastard outside.
		I can't get away from him.  He's fucking
		with my mind.  He's my punishment!

			ANTHONY
		I'm confused.  Before you said it came out
		of the torso, not the head --

			RIPLEY
		I don't feel like a discussion of Alien biology.

John comes up next to her.

			JOHN
		Ripley, don't --

She pushes him away and sinks to the floor.

			RIPLEY
		I should just wait for the air to run out...

			JOHN
		I believe - I know - that we can win --
		there is an answer in our books.

			RIPLEY
		Your books?  Your books are gone, Brother.
		Your world is gone.  Once that thing starts
		to lay its eggs, all your brothers - if
		they aren't already - are dead.

			JOHN	
		If that's true, then all of us, the books,
		are consigned to ashes.

He clasps his hands and bows his head.
The Abbot's blood drips off his hands.
Plip - plop!
Into a little puddle at Ripley's feet.
She stares at the blood.  Aahk.
Feels the PAIN again.
Runs her hand across her chest...

			ANTHONY O/S
		Ripley?

			RIPLEY
		What?

			ANTHONY
		There are several inconsistancies between
		this and the other Aliens you described.

			RIPLEY
		Give it up.

			ANTHONY
		I think this is important.  This may help
		us fight it.  The creature that I fought
		in the hall - when I first saw it, it had
		camoflaged itself to look like wood.

Ripley looks up.
			
			RIPLEY
		Wood?  When I saw it in my room it looked
		the way it did before -- black, mechanical --
		unless that was a dream.

			ANTHONY
		I don't think it was.  I think that this 
		creature, if it is the efficient predator
		that you say it is, has the ability to
		adapt to its environment.

			RIPLEY
		Then the reason they've always looked the
		same to me is that I only ever saw them in
		the same environment.

			ANTHONY
		Or this may be an as yet unseen stage of
		development -- you saw a queen -- This
		could be like a King ant -- more highly
		advanced than the drone, bred for 
		survival -?

			JOHN
		How does this explain the thing that came
		out of the ewe's chest?  The Abbot's head?

			RIPLEY
		Maybe it can deposit different types of
		eggs.  The chest burster is probably
		dormant until the host eats - The first
		one I ever saw came out of Kane after he
		started to eat --

And in one horrible moment she realizes:
She hasn't eaten.  The pain in her chest...

			RIPLEY
		No.

Anthony "looks" towards her - does he realize as well?

			JOHN
		No what?

			RIPLEY
		No, we're not beat yet, Father --

			JOHN
		Brother --

Ripley gets up.

			RIPLEY
		Brother.  Not yet.  If he's taunting me,
		then maybe we can use that.  We can beat
		this bastard.  We can get to my ship.
		We can live.

								CUT TO:

INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM

John stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the 
ceiling.  Holds a torch.
Ripley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed 
out in front of him.  Skin is palid.

			ANTHONY
		Don't have second thoughts.  Blind and
		crippled I would only slow you down.
		Give him time to figure out what you're
		doing.  Just leave me my staff.

			RIPLEY
		Okay.  Good luck.

She shakes his hand.  He pulls her closer.
Anthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley.

			ANTHONY
		Ripley, I know.  Good luck.

			RIPLEY
		Sit tight.

Ripley crosses to John.  Poised at the bottom of the ladder they
look up at the trap door on the ceiling.

			RIPLEY
		He could be waiting on the other side
		of that door.  We might not get ten feet
		before he kills the three of us.

He shakes his head.

			JOHN
		We had better go, then.

He smiles.
She smiles back.
They move up the ladder.

It leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, to


AN UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGHT

The ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier.  Ripley and John
climb out onto the wooden structure.  Before them:

AN UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet,
over five miles across.  The floor of the lowest level of the
top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred
feet overhead.

The water sparkles with a golden glow.

			JOHN
		Must be day on the surface of the planet.

			RIPLEY
		Where is the light coming from?
	
			JOHN
		Mirrors.  Reflect the outside light down
		great shafts -- through lenses.  That's
		what they make in the glass factory. 
		Lenses.  Look --

She turns:

A HUGE WATERFALL

Lit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours
into the sea a short distance from them.

			JOHN
		Opens to the surface.  Water flows in
		and out.  I don't know how.  There's one
		at either end.  I came down on the other
		side.

			RIPLEY
		What do we do?

John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at
the end of their ropes.

			JOHN
		We cross.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY

Anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the
bottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his
tender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS.
The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head.
The wind blows through his hair.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
Feels good.

Anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."

			ANTHONY
		Now the seer can only see what God wants
		him to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks
		and I've finally found religion.

A floor board CREAKS.
Anthony strains to hear:

			ANTHONY
		John?  Ripley?

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
He knows it is not.

			ANTHONY
		Well come then.  I haven't got forever.

A shadow falls across his face.  He can feel it.
He doesn't have to see what is here.


THE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGHT

The leather boat makes its way across the sea.
John rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft.
As night falls she takes the oars.

The Ocean is dead calm.  The coracle glides across the glass-
like surface.  John flexes his scarred fingers.

			RIPLEY
		Your hands okay?

			JOHN
		They'll be fine.  You've been on
		a boat before.

Ripley squints ahead of them.
The ocean seems to go on forever.

			RIPLEY
		I was a warrant officer on a ship --
		but I did all my sailing in space.

			JOHN		
		Father Anselm used to take me on his
		coracle when I was little.

Ripley leans forward - scans his face.

			RIPLEY
		How old were you when they towed
		this satellite out here?	

			JOHN
		Five.  The Abbot said they put us to 
		sleep for the thirty years it took
		to get here.  We've had almost forty
		more.  Until now.

			RIPLEY
		What happened to your mother?

			JOHN
		Never had one.  I mean, never knew her.
		I mean, I did, once.  She left my father
		when he joined the movement.  If she
		hadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept
		the other children with the women, on
		Earth.  That was too long ago now.  Like
		a dream.

Ripley's face grows strangely dark.  She turns to the water.

			RIPLEY
		Did you know that I was a mother?

			JOHN
		The girl in the ship with -?

			RIPLEY
		No.  On Earth.  I never mentioned my
		daughter.  My daughter.  I have - had
		I guess, by now - a daughter on Earth.
		Kathy.  She was nine when I signed on to
		the Nostromo.  Mommy will be home before
		you know it I said.  My shares would have
		set us up good.  Then I lost sixty years
		floating around in a rescue pod.  Thanks
		to the Alien.  I came home to face a bitter,
		70 year old woman.  My daughter.  A little
		girl who's mother never came home.

			JOHN
		Jesus Christ.

			RIPLEY
		They said I should have been happy to be
		alive.  Funny, huh?  That's why I went
		back the second time.  Not so I could
		fight it -- You can't fight it -- So
		I could let it kill me.

She rubs her chest --

			JOHN
		You didn't choose to get lost in space.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks for the try Father --

			JOHN
		Brother.

			RIPLEY
		Brother, but I'm not looking for absolution.
		I couldn't be a good mother to my daughter.
		I couldn't be a good mother to Newt.  But
		I can be a good mother to you.  I can make
		sure you survive.

Suddenly they feel rain --
Ripley holds out her hand.
Her eyes open wide at what she sees.
John takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side:

The Ocean has become red with BLOOD.
Blood DRIPS down from the ceiling around them.

			RIPLEY
		Blood.

John looks up.

			JOHN
		From the levels above.

His face goes white.

			JOHN
		He must have slaughtered all --

			RIPLEY
		Don't think about it.  Don't think about
		what's up there.  Just row.

As Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move
across the surface.
She doesn't notice.


A SHAPE

Passes underneath the boat.  A swimming CREATURE.  The Alien.
Thanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears HUGE.
Dwarfs their coracle.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - NIGHT

All the windmills are BURNING.
Flaming arms lazily turning.
Anthony is not in sight.
Whoosh...Whoosh...


THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN - NIGHT

Another dock with ladders going up and down.
Ripley and John climb out of the coracle.
Don't waste time tying off.  They go  --


UP THE LADDER

A hundred foot climb.  The wood is twisted.
Rungs have been torn away in some places.
They pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest
foothold.  The temperature rises as they do.
Sweat runs into their eyes.

Soon they can see the floor above them:
BLACKENED by intense heat.
They climb.


INT. UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELDS - NIGHT

Ripley and John come up from the level below.

			RIPLEY
		Holy shit.

John crosses himself.

Another testament to the terrible battle with the Alien.
Reduced to just a huge, blackened floor.
All the crops burned to ash --
Their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks.
Their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead --
Ripley would puke if she had any food in her body.

			JOHN
		There's Andrew.  And Raphael.  Peter...

			RIPLEY
		Stop.  How far?

			JOHN
		We're right below the Abbey now.

They cross the smoldering field.
The scorched floor threatens to give way under John's feet --
Ripley pull him to one side.


THE MONASTERY LEVEL

Heaven has become HELL.
The ground, the buildings, the Sky-timber - all blackened.
FIRES burn everywhere.  Air choked with gray smoke and dust
pouring in from the Orbiter's surface through rends in the
vaulted ceiling.


RIPLEY AND JOHN

Climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's 
hinges.  They look at the grim tableau:

Monks impaled on their own pikes.
Tangled together in their own pungy stakes.
Alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies.


THE MONASTERY

Flickering fires lit the first few floor windows.
Ripley takes a step towards it --
Reaches back and pulls John...


INT. GLASS FACTORY - NIGHT

The Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow.
Small fires burn out of control around the room.
Finished glass pieces BURST from the heat.
Ripley and John enter.

			JOHN
		This is the glassworks.  They have
		tools here --
			(spots)
		Kyle --

He runs across the room --


BROTHER KYLE

Sits calmly at the Marver table.
He places playing cards on the table in front of him.
Solitaire.  
He sings to himself quietly.

			KYLE
		     (sotto)
		Can't see my baby.
		Don't see my baby.  Bay be.

John grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet.
The playing cards fall to the floor --
Kyle watches them, not John.

			JOHN
		Kyle.  Brother Kyle.

			KYLE
		Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup.
		Black king on red queen, put the
		ace up --

John SHAKES him.

			JOHN
		Kyle goddammit!

Ripley moves closer.

			RIPLEY
		John - it's too late --

Kyle begins to sing faster.  Faster.

			KYLE
		Ace up.  Put the ace up.  Redaceupup.
		Blackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka-
		boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma
		looma --

Ripley and John look at each other.
They know what this means.
John pulls a length of rope off a nearby table.
Moves in front of Kyle.  Looks into his glassy eyes.
A tear runs down his cheek.

			JOHN
		Keep singing, my friend.

John loops the rope around Kyle's neck.
Strangles him.
Eases the lifeless body to the floor.
Stares at it.


RIPLEY

Pulls a blowing iron from the rack.  Feels its weight and
balance.  A reasonable weapon.  She crosses to John.

			JOHN
		I killed him.  I'm a doctor and I
		killed him.

			RIPLEY
		You had to.  You're supposed to end
		suffering.

She hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form the
molten glass shapes.

			RIPLEY
		Let's get the hell out of here.


INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Ripley and John move up the stairs.
Flickering orange lit from below.
Smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors.


INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

They enter carefully.  The room is exactly as John left it,
books out of shelves, hanging on their chains.

			RIPLEY
		He's made a mess.

John pushes ahead of her.

			JOHN
		No.  He hasn't been up here yet.  I 
		did this.

He moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open
the lock --

			JOHN
		Here - philosophy - we'll start here --

AAAROO --!
A HAIRY BLUR flies out from between the stacks --
WHUMPH!  Knocks John to the floor --
Licks his face.

			JOHN
		Mattias!

The happy dog leaps all over his master.

			JOHN		
		He waited.  Ripley, this is Mattias.  My
		dog.  Good fellow.

Ripley crosses to them.

			RIPLEY
		I'm glad.  Really.  But we've probably
		only got a few minutes before this
		entire place goes up in flames.  Just
		grab whatever books you want and --

Ripley leans in to pet Mattias.
Mattias draws his lip back.  Growls.
He's looking over Ripley's shoulder.

She turns around slowly...


THE ALIEN

Standing in the open doorway.
It's in bad shape from the man traps.
Lost a foot.  Tongue hanging out, useless.
Parts of it look like wood.  Parts of it look like wheat.

It carries Anthony's waterlogged, limp body --
POPS off his head like a grape from the bunch.
Tosses the corpse at Ripley's feet.

I could swear it's trying to smile.


RIPLEY AND JOHN

Back against the book stacks.
John grabs Mattias' collar.
The Dog GROWLS at the Alien intruder...

			JOHN
		Easy, boy...

			RIPLEY
		Is there another way out?

			JOHN
		Not that will do us any good.


THE ALIEN

Limps into the room dragging one foot.
It's breathing is labored.  Dripping acid blood leaves a thin
trail of fire behind it.

			JOHN
		We hurt it.

The Alien draws itself up to its full height --
Even wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker.

			RIPLEY
		You wanna give it a bandage?  Look --
		Where is my ship from here?

			JOHN
		On the roof directly above this room.

			RIPLEY
		Here's the plan --
		
			JOHN
		But the books --

			RIPLEY
		Forget the books!

RUFF!!
Mattias pulls free from John's grasp --
Runs to the Alien --

			RIPLEY
		Shit.


MATTIAS

Snaps and barks at the Alien --
Leaping about to dodge its claws.
Draws its attention --


RIPLEY AND JOHN

RUN at the Alien.
It is trying to spear the dog with its tail.
John swings the iron rod -- THWAP -!
HITS the Alien across the back of its bulbous head --

It turns to him --

SPLIIIITCH -!
Ripley SHOVES the blowing iron into the Alien's torso.
His acid blood SPURTS out the end of the hollow tube --
SPLATTERS Ripley's cassock - she TEARS it off --

John grabs Mattias -- pulls him back.

The Alien SPINS in a circle --
Blood SPRAYING around him -

Creating a CIRCLE OF FIRE about him --
IGNITING the books --

			JOHN
		No!  THE BOOKS!!

			RIPLEY
		Don't --!

John steps forward -- Ripley grabs for him --
The ACID EATS through the wooden floor --


THE FLOOR COLLAPSES

The Alien, John and Ripley PLUMMET down -!
THROUGH the next floor --


INTO THE GLASSWORKS

The Alien FALLS into the molten glass vat --
SCREECHES - arms flailing as it sinks beneath the surface of
the thousand degree liquid.


JOHN

Finds himself HANGING over the bubbling glass vat - Caught -
DANGLING on the Flying Fox rope.  Five feet away - the ledge the
Flying Fox is launched from.  He looks down:

He can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him.  To its
right, the Water DUMP TANK - a large wine cask-looking affair
where finished pieces are cooled.  He looks up:

Ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above.

			JOHN
		Are you all right?

Ripley grunts an affirmative response.
At least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop to
the floor.  John is looking at instant par-boiling.
John starts to move hand over hand UP the rope.  He begins to
sweat.
A drop of sweat falls...
HSSS!
POPS AND SIZZLES as it hits the surface of the molten glass --


RIPLEY

Tries to pull herself up to the floor above --
The next level is a raging fire.

She can only hang and DROP.  She DOES -!
Falls the two stories.
Bends her knees and ROLLS on impact.


JOHN

Has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace.
He stands.  Sees Ripley slowly rising --

			JOHN
		Ripley -!

Ripley shakily gets to her feet.
Hops on one foot.

			RIPLEY
		Aargh.  I'm fine.  Let's get the fuck
		out of --

SUDDENLY

THE ALIEN'S head breaks the surface of the molten glass.
SCREAMING.  STEAMING.  It is white-hot -
translucent -- covered with -- 
It looks like MOLTEN GLASS!!

Hook-like hands grasp the edge of the tank --
It tries to climb out --

Ripley turns to run.  Tender ankle gives out.
She falls face down on the floor --
Rolls over --

THE ALIEN is going to climb out of the vat --
She SCREAMS --


JOHN

Grabs the Flying Fox handle.
SWINGS down the rope - across the room --
PAST the Alien --

It turns away from Ripley -
She scrambles across the floor...

John lands HARD.
Points --

			JOHN
		Ripley - the lever!!

Ripley looks next to her:  a burning wooden lever.

The Alien has one foot out of the glass furnace --

RIPLEY grabs the lever -- Hssssst!
Putting out the fire with her hand --
Pulls --


THE HUGE DUMP TANK OF WATER

DUMPS.  Empties a thousand gallons --
RAINS DOWN on the Alien. 
It HOWLS in pain --

The Molten Glass instantly COOLS --
The rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to
BE-THWOOOoooOOM -!!
EXPLODE into a million pieces...!!!!

Ripley helps John off the floor.
They are battered.  Bloody.
They look into the vat.
The steam clears...

The room is littered with Alien Bits.
Each piece is encased in glass --
Trapped like a fly in amber.

			JOHN
		Saw that happen to a bottle once.

			RIPLEY
		    (panting)
		Beat... Beat him - ugh --

She grabs her stomach as her knees give out.
John gives her an arm for support.

			JOHN
		We've got to get to the Library --

			RIPLEY
		Don't worry.  Ship.  Just --

They look up:

Mattias looks down through the hole in the floor.
BARKS...


INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

An INFERNO.
Every bookshelf ablaze.  The floor dotted with pools of flame.
Ripley and John are at the door - held back by the heat --

John tries to enter the room --
Ripley grabs him --

			RIPLEY
		Don't be stupid --

			JOHN
		Some of them!  I've got to save some of
		them!  Mattias!!

Mattias yelps in response.  Threads his way through to them.
Ripley spins him to face her.  Tears stream down his cheeks.

			RIPLEY
		They're lost.  You did your best.  If
		you get out, it wasn't in vain.
		We've got to live!!

She YANKS him into the hallway --

							CUT TO:

EXT. MONASTERY - THE ROOF - NIGHT

Ripley's good foot KICKS down the burning planks that surround
the escape ship.  John and Mattias stand behind as she climbs
through to the ship.  John looks around:

The ABBEY LEVEL is devastated.  The air is filled with smoke.
The Abbey is burning.  The Library is in flames.

John looks down at his medical bag.
Torn, bloody, scorched, it still hangs from his shoulders.
Inside: The only remaining book.

			RIPLEY O/S
		Come on in!

John and Mattias step through --


INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 - NIGHT

Ripley CLICKS on the lights.
John lifts Mattias into the hatch.

			JOHN
		The Library --

			RIPLEY
		I told you -- the Earth is still there --

Ripley checks an instrument:  Elapsed travel time.
Her brows knit.  She TAPS the gauge.

			RIPLEY
		Not working.

			JOHN
		What does that mean?

			RIPLEY
		It means I don't know how long I was
		in hyper sleep.

			JOHN
		It means the Abbot could've been right --
		
			RIPLEY
		It means my clock isn't working.  We have
		to get out of here.  Even if he was right
		this ship's onboard computer is filled 
		with man's knowledge.

			JOHN
		Not everything.  Some things will be
		lost forever. 

			RIPLEY
		Then man starts over.  He's done it
		before.

She pushes a few buttons.  Somewhere under the floor a 
propulsion source HUMS to life.  THROBBING through the soles
of John's feet.  Ripley is absorbed in her work.

			RIPLEY
		Okay.  The seals weren't broken so
		we're probably clear.  But those dead
		monks out there are going to start
		hatching soon.  Let's get ready to
		take off.

			JOHN
		What can I do?

			RIPLEY
		Here, I need a compressor tank from
		in that compartment.

She motions towards an open door.
John enters the compartment.
Whoosh-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

			JOHN
		Hey!  What?!

He looks out the window in the door.  

Ripley is staring at him, punching keys on a pad next to the
door.

			JOHN
		Hey - I'm locked in.

Mattias scratches at the door.

			RIPLEY
		I know.  I locked you in.

			JOHN
		What?

			RIPLEY
		I'm not going with you.  I've got one
		inside me.
	
			JOHN
		What?!  You can't --

She runs a hand across her midsection.

			RIPLEY
		I figured it out.  That's why it didn't
		kill me.  He must have impregnated me
		when I was in the stasis tube.
		    (remembers nightmare)
		It hasn't come out yet because I 
		haven't eaten, It's still dormant.  So
		either I eat and it kills me or I don't
		eat and I starve to death.  Either way 
		I die.

John pulls the Medieval Tome out of his medical bag.

			JOHN	
		My book -- I know what to do --

			RIPLEY
		What, an exorcism?  No good.

			JOHN
		You can't do this.  Ripley - listen
		to me - you're confusing feeling of
		guilt for actual sin - I can help you --

			RIPLEY
		    (ignoring)
		I've set a time lock.  When the pod escapes
		the Colony's gravitational pull this
		compartment will open.  Then all you have 
		to do is get into the Stasis tube with
		Mattias and press the blue button.  With
		any luck a freighter or something will
		pick you up.  Good luck.

He pounds his fists against the door.

			JOHN
		NO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this.
		You can't let it win.

She turns away from the door.

			RIPLEY
		It always wins.  We killed it, but it's
		still inside me -- You're my last chance.
		If I can keep you alive it'll make up
		for all those I've lost.

			JOHN
		Listen to me!  You have to let me try!
		Ripley:  You're MY only chance!

She's listening...

			JOHN
		I told you Father Anselm raised me.
		He raised me and when he was dying I
		couldn't do anything to save him.  I 
		didn't know enough.  It was my fault
		he died.  If you don't let me try to
		save you my body will live but my soul
		will be dead.

Ripley turns and stares at him.

			JOHN
		Please.

								CUT TO:


THE PAGE

A MEDIEVAL ETCHING.
A Monk vomits up the devil.

Pull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor.
John closes his eyes.
Closes the book.

He pours some water into a small plastic cup.
Retrieves a small pouch of herbs.  Opens it.
Wrinkles his nose - they smell --
pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup.

			RIPLEY
		What is this stuff?

			JOHN
		     (forceful)
		Something that will make you well.
		Something that will make you sick.

			RIPLEY
		I don't --

			JOHN
		Shut up and drink.

He lifts the back of Ripley's head --
FORCES the drink down her throat.

John swings his leg over her midsection.  STRADDLES her.
Presses his two hands together in prayer.
Then balls them into one fist.
Takes a deep, preparatory breath...

Ripley starts to GAG -- Cough.
Her body starts to JERK --

John BRINGS HIS FIST DOWN INTO HER STOMACH --
WHAMM -!!

Ripley CONVULSES -- has the dry heaves --

WHAM!  WHAM --!
John PUMMELS Ripley's diaphragm!

She sputters -- VOMITS a thick mucous-like substance --
HEAVES --

Ripley's back arches --
She SCREAMS a gut wrenching WAIL --
Her torso BULGES as the creature is forced upwards.

John BEARS down --
Pushes UP under her ribs --
FORCING the chest-burster up her throat --

Ripley fights for air as the alien STOPS halfway up her 
esophagus -- She's choking --

John crosses himself -- takes a deep breath --
Lowers his mouth to hers --
Inhales.  Exhales.  CPR.


THE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER

SLITHERS out of Ripley's mouth --

INTO JOHN'S!!
Reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet.

John falls back against a computer console.
Gagging.  Fights to speak.

Ripley raises herself up on one elbow.
Alien mucous drooling down her chin.
Hair matted against her forehead.

			RIPLEY
		Why?
	
			JOHN
		Choking.  It was the only way.

He drops the open book in front of her:
She sees the etching.


JOHN

Gulps back the oozing slime.
Struggles to his feet.

			JOHN
		They knew.

			RIPLEY
		But you --

Ripley tries to stand - to go after him --
She can't sit up -- feels like a rib might be cracked.

			RIPLEY
		You'll die --

John stumbles to the Pod door.  Turns back.

			JOHN	
		That's idea.  Join...my brothers.  If
		we were right, Heaven.  If we were wrong --
		either way, where we belong.  World of
		books.  Pages.

He draws the parchment out of his bag.
Drops it to the floor.

			JOHN
		You... are from the real world.

He starts to step through the door --
Mattias tries to follow.

			JOHN
		Stay -- both of you.

He exits the Pod.

Ripley drags herself across the floor.

			RIPLEY
		No - wait!  John!

To the Door.  Looks out:


BROTHER JOHN

Dawn's rays are peeking through the battered ceiling as he
walks slowly across the smoking roof.
Into the inferno that is the burning Abbey.

Ripley watches as John and the alien horror inside him are
INCINERATED.

The heat of the flames grows.
She must pull back --
Reaches up for the door handle.
It closes with a THUD.

She rolls onto her back.
She weeps.  For the first time in years.
She's been absolved.

CREeeek -!!
The escape pod SHIFTS.
Ripley's eyes SNAP open --

The Roof beneath the Pod is beginning to GIVE WAY.

Ripley rolls onto her stomach and drags herself to the
pilot's chair.  Pulls herself into the seat.
Straps herself in --


SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4

Blasts THROUGH the wooden outershell of the Orbiter Arceon.
ROARS towards us - past us.


INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 = DAY

Ripley places Mattias into the Hyper sleep tube.
Rubs under his chin.  Is about to climb in with him when she
spots something on the floor --


JOHN'S PARCHMENT

Ripley picks it up and unrolls it.
She hears John's voice:

			JOHN V.O.
		I, Brother John Goldman of the orbiter
		Arceon, Minorite abbey and gaol, know
		the Abbot was wrong.  There is a great
		evil here.  I have seen it.  I put pen to
		paper now lest this plague - this creature
		stills my hand.  I have gone down below -
		both to try to warn the others and get 
		the woman - Ripley - get from her some
		clue as to how to battle this evil, or
		at least to make my peace for not
		defending her.  She believes there is
		still and Earth and I hope she is right.
		I hope she will be able to find out.
		I hope she can find some rest for the
		devils that torment her.

Ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the command
console.  Pulls a pen from it's holder.  She adds:

			RIPLEY V.O.
		Whether the Earth exists or not, whether
		we end up in Heaven, or Hell, or the cold
		vacuum of space, she has.

She sets her course.
Gets back into her tube.
Closes the lid.


DEEP SPACE

The escape pod moves through the jet-black void...


ARCEON

Dwindles into the darkness behind her, a smouldering, slowly
dying ember...

							THE SCREEN GOES BLACK


END CREDITS ROLL...


		Teenager in the back of the movie theater shouts,

AMERICAN PSYCHO


INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT 

An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side. 
The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged 
silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths 
decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous 
exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and 
confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: 
pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Ala�a, Armani power suits.

CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.

WAITER 
With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula 
Caesar salad. For entr�es tonight I have a swordfish 
meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge 
breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...

Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen 
table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four 
inches square and look exactly alike.

CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of 
conversation. "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse 
me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet."

WAITER 
And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our 
pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...

CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate 
perpendicular desserts descending on another table.

PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID 
VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing 
expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back 
hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses. 

The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:

BATEMAN (V.O.)
We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California 
place on the Upper East Side.

The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately 
decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's 
description of each of the men at the table.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in 
a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences 
between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van 
Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the 
best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a 
bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten 
keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . 

VAN PATTEN 
What are the rules for a sweater vest?

McDERMOTT 
What do you mean?

PRICE 
Yes. Clarify.

McDERMOTT 
Well, is it strictly informal-

BATEMAN 
Or can it be worn with a suit?

McDERMOTT 
(Smiling) 
Exactly

BATEMAN 
With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or 
charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder 
vest.

McDERMOTT 
But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or
tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look 
too studied.

VAN PATTEN 
You think so?

PRICE 
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.

VAN PATTEN 
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.

Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy 
discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.

BATEMAN 
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?

PRICE 
It looks that way, doesn't it?

McDERMOTT 
(Staring at retreating waiter) 
Did he just take our plates away?

PRICE 
He took them away because the portions are so small he 
probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. 
This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?

McDERMOTT 
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.
(He guffaws)

Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.

McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man
with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Is that Reed Robinson over there?
PRICE 
Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.

McDERMOTT 
Who is it then?

PRICE 
That's Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the
room. Over there.

He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back 
hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Who is he with?

PRICE 
(Distracted by the waitress's 
cleavage as she bends over to 
uncork a bottle of wine � the 
waitress glares at him) 
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

Van Patten returns.

VAN PATTEN 
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.

McDERMOTT 
Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?

PRICE 
Yes. McDufus, I am.

McDERMOTT 
He's handling the Fisher account.

PRICE 
Lucky bastard.

McDERMOTT 
Lucky Jew bastard.

BATEMAN 
Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with 
anything?

McDERMOTT 
Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the
phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The 
bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.

BATEMAN 
You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah. 
You spin a dreidel.

McDERMOTT 
Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?

BATEMAN 
No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

McDERMOTT 
Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the 
ACLU.

Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.

PRICE 
The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking 
of reasonable...

He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.

McDERMOTT 
Only $470.

VAN PATTEN 
(Without irony) 
Not bad.

The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap
down on the table.

INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is 
lighting up a cigar.

McDERMOTT 
Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-

VAN PATTEN 
Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this 
story again.

McDERMOTT 
But I never told you what happened afterwards. So 
okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big 
tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I 
buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on 
spring break and she's practically blowing me in the 
Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-

BATEMAN 
Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all 
this?

McDERMOTT 
Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick 
who's gonna let me-

VAN PATTEN 
(Putting his hands over his ears) 
I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something 
disgusting.

McDERMOTT 
You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op 
together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some 
chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.

Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.

McDERMOTT 
Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to 
this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking 
rhino tipsy, and get this-

VAN PATTEN 
She let you fuck her without a condom?

McDERMOTT 
This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She 
would only-are you ready? 
(Dramatic pause) 
She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept 
her glove on.

The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.

ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.

EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel. 
McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN, 
who looks confused.

McDERMOTT 
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask 
him if he takes American Express.

PRICE 
(Offering card) 
You take Amex, dude?

The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine, 
unhooks the 
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.

INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT 

Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a 
black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels. 
MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls 
stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the 
counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as 
women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they 
wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple 
lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes 
past them and slams the door.

PRICE 
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the 
AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, 
then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular 
dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for 
Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-

BATEMAN 
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a 
virus.

PRICE 
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.

Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is 
sweating.

PRICE 
I'm shaking. You open it.

Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.

PRICE
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?

BATEMAN 
Maybe it's just the light.

PRICE 
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips 
the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) 
Oh my God...

BATEMAN 
What?

PRICE 
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!

Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.

BATEMAN 
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do 
enough of it we'll be okay.

PRICE 
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it 
on my fucking All-Bran.

The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate 
voice:

GUY IN STALL 
Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!

Price pounds his fist against the stall.

PRICE 
(screaming) 
SHUT UP!

BATEMAN 
Calm down. Let's do it anyway

PRICE 
I guess you're right...
(Raising his voice) 
THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!

GUY IN STALL 
Fuck you!

PRICE 
(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider) 
No, FUCK YOU!! 
(He collapses, panting against the stall door) 
Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.

BATEMAN 
That's the spirit.

They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope 
of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking 
their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into 
their gums.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 

Bateman saunters toward the bar as "Pump Up the Volume" 
plays in the background.

BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.

He hands her two drink tickets.

BARGIRL 
It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's 
a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.

Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her 
a $50.

She turns her back and searches the cash register for 
change.

BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to 
death and then play around with your blood.

The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is 
smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING 

Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light. 
A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows 
looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist 
high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large 
Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive 
electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly 
impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of 
a design magazine.

BATEMAN (V.0.) 
My name is Patrick Bateman. I am 
twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden 
Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh 
floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.

Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to 
see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his 
toilet.

BATEMAN 
(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a 
balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the 
morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice 
pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand 
now.

Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.

Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living 
room wearing the ice pack.

CUT TO:

A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the 
shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep 
pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a 
water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body 
scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.

Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a 
gel facial masque.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which 
I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my 
routine.

Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is 
stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He 
begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in 
readiness on the marble counter.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I always use an after-shave lotion with little 
or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes 
you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye 
balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion...

Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried, 
giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been 
wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque 
off his face.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some 
kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an 
entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold 
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you 
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably 
comparable: I simply am not there.

INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING 

Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled 
white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large 
expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by 
Bateman's interior decorator.

Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a 
huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts, 
shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and 
tone.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
It is hard for me to make sense on any given 
level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality 
is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is 
persistent.

Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a 
full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom, 
adjusting his cuff-links.

BATEMAN (V.0.) 
My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared 
a long time ago, if they ever did exist.

He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees. 
He gives his reflection a smile.

INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY 

As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who 
looks just like him.

MAN 
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling 
his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive, 
wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.

JEAN 
Late?

BATEMAN 
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?

JEAN 
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what 
he was canceling or why.

BATEMAN 
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. 
Anyone else?

JEAN 
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.

BATEMAN 
When?

JEAN 
After six.

BATEMAN 
Negative. Cancel it.

Jean follows him into his office.

JEAN 
Oh? And what should I say?

BATEMAN
Just...say...no.

JEAN 
Just say no?

Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.

BATEMAN 
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols 
at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All 
right?

JEAN 
(Playfully) 
Yes, sir.

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight 
tonight.

Jean turns around.

JEAN 
Oh, something. . romantic?

BATEMAN 
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.

JEAN 
I'll do it.

BATEMAN 
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?

JEAN 
You look nice today.

Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his 
office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a 
slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a 
beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a 
Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment 
later with the Perrier and a file.

JEAN 
Yes?

BATEMAN 
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that 
outfit again.

JEAN 
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.

BATEMAN 
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a 
dress. A skirt or something.

Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.

JEAN 
(Smiling bravely) 
You don't like this, I take it?

BATEMAN 
Come on, you're prettier than that.

JEAN 
(Sarcastically) 
Thanks, Patrick.

The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.

As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner 
of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!

INT. TAXI - EVENING 

EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's 
fianc�e, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping 
a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically 
beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with 
herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a 
small child.

EVELYN 
I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd 
want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something 
ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots 
of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring 
out the window.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I'm trying to listen to the new George 
Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fianc�e-keeps buzzing 
in my ear.

Evelyn continues to make notes.

EVELYN 
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. 
Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. 
And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.

BATEMAN 
(Removing his Walkman) 
Do...what.

EVELYN 
Get married. Have a wedding.

BATEMAN 
Evelyn?

EVELYN 
Yes, darling?

BATEMAN 
Is your Evian spiked?

EVELYN 
We should do it.

BATEMAN 
No-I can't take the time off work.

EVELYN 
Your father practically owns the company. You can do 
anything you like, silly.

BATEMAN 
I don't want to talk about it.

EVELYN 
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just 
quit? You don't have to work.

BATEMAN 
Because I...want...to...fit...in.

The taxi bumps to a halt.

INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT 

A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in 
self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed 
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel 
smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are 
made of extremely uncomfortable 
bolted steel.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace 
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, 
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are 
already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen, 
with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with 
ragged black hair and bad skin.

They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus 
that look like minimalist art.

PRICE 
The menu's in braille.

He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long 
kiss.

PRICE 
I have to talk to you.

He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.

EVELYN 
(Over her shoulder) 
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden 
and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.

BATEMAN 
(After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and 
checking his hair) 
Hi. Pat Bateman.

Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.

BATEMAN 
Let me guess-you live in the East Village?

Pause.

STASH 
SoHo.

COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table. 
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from 
precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is 
considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is 
half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a 
rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He 
wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and 
Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets, 
bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.

They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back, 
Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.

COURTNEY 
(Whispering) 
Stop it!

Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.

LATER:

Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is 
quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching 
Evelyn and Price.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn 
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s 
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight 
I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use, 
though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, 
the biggest dufus in the business.

Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.

COURTNEY
Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is 
becoming to...commercial?

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I read that.

PRICE 
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

VANDEN 
Hey. That affects us.

PRICE 
(Wired on coke) 
Oh ho ho. That affects us? What 
about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that 
affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri 
Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of 
Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?

BATEMAN 
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important 
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign 
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems 
at hand.

PRICE 
Like what?

BATEMAN 
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow 
down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world 
hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We 
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We 
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and 
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while 
also promoting equal rights for women but change the 
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still 
somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.

The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.

BATEMAN 
We also have to control the influx of illegal 
immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional 
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in 
movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have 
to promote general social concern and less materialism in 
young people.

Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and 
mystified.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick, how thought-provoking.

INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING 

Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.

BATEMAN 
Why don t you just go for Price?

EVELYN 
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?

BATEMAN 
He's rich.

EVELYN 
Everybody's rich.

BATEMAN 
He's good-looking.

EVELYN 
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
He has a great body

EVELYN 
Everybody has a great body now.

Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get 
Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the 
Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally, 
he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to 
look around him at the TV, then takes notice.

EVELYN 
What do you want to do with that, floss with it?

Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.

EVELYN 
Are you using minoxidil?

BATEMAN 
No. I'm not. Why should I ?

EVELYN 
Your hairline looks like it's receding.

BATEMAN 
It's not.

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 

It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the 
comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine. 
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk 
past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his 
wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up 
to her as she pauses at a red light.

BATEMAN 
Hello.

The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing 
his smile, smiles back.

INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY 

Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit 
with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry 
cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the 
counter.

BATEMAN 
Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait...
you're not giving me valid reasons.

The woman continues to speak to him in another language, 
grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.

BATEMAN 
What are you trying to say to me?

Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained 
sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.

BATEMAN 
Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee? 
Bleach-ee. Oh my God.

She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.

BATEMAN 
(Talking over her) 
Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question. 
Two.
(Louder) 
Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very 
expensive sheets and I really need them clean.

She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.

BATEMAN 
If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill 
you, are you understanding me?

She talks faster.

BATEMAN 
Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting 
(Checks Rolex) 
at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those 
...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at 
Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need 
those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.

She keeps talking.

BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.

Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the 
counter.

BATEMAN 
This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with 
this.

Bateman is on the verge of tears.

BATEMAN 
Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!

Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA, 
late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a 
tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.

VICTORIA 
Patrick?

She takes off her sunglasses.

VICTORIA 
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

BATEMAN 
Hello 
(Mumbles un incomprehensible name)

Awkward pause.

BATEMAN 
Well.

VICTORIA 
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, 
but you
know. They really are the best.

BATEMAN 
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk 
to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding 
up. She
touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking 
again.

VICTORIA 
Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.
BATEMAN 
Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.

VICTORiA 
(Skeptically) Really?

BATEMAN 
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You 
know, like...
like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?

VICTORIA 
(As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it. 
Fun with chocolate.

BATEMAN 
Listen, if you could talk to them 
(He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand) 
I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a 
lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.

Bateman turns to leave.

VICTORIA 
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?

BATEMAN 
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank 
you, uh...
Victoria?

VICTORIA 
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You 
know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

BATEMAN 
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the 
time.

VICTORIA 
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?

BATEMAN 
(Checking his watch) 
Next Saturday?

VICTORIA 
(Shrugging) 
Yeah.

BATEMAN 
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin�e of Les Miserables. 
Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call 
you.

VICTORIA 
Okay. Do.

Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes 
out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound 
of the bell on the closing door.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to 
Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one 
hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear 
the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.

BATEMAN 
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

COURTNEY 
What? Oh, I'm...busy.

BATEMAN 
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, 
and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to 
tonight?

COURTNEY 
Stop it. I'm...

BATEMAN 
On a lot of lithium?

COURTNEY 
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call 
tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
You should come have dinner with me.
COURTNEY 
But-when?

BATEMAN 
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?

COURTNEY 
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I 
need to be
home for that.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin?

COURTNEY 
Yes?

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

COURTNEY 
Uh huh.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New 
York.

COURTNEY 
I know. Stop it.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling 
dickweed.

COURTNEY 
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.

BATEMAN 
Courtney? Dinner?

COURTNEY 
I can't.

BATEMAN 
I'm thinking Dorsia.

COURTNEY 
Dorsia's nice.

BATEMAN 
Nice?

COURTNEY 
You like it there, don't you?

BATEMAN 
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will 
you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a 
boyfriend to eat there tonight.

COURTNEY 
Okay. Yeah. What time?

BATEMAN 
Eight? 

COURTNEY 
Pick me up? 

BATEMAN 
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear 
something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the 
number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so 
he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with 
his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there 
is finally an answer.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia. Please hold.

He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia.

BATEMAN 
(Both of his eyes are closed) 
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to 
reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then 
more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he 
hangs up the phone.

INT. TAXI- NIGHT

Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is
heavily medicated.

COURTNEY 
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really 
relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this 
silver muffin dish. 
(She starts to pass out)

BATEMAN 
Is that Donald Trump's car?

COURTNEY 
(Thickly) 
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

BATEMAN 
You know, Courtney, you should take some more 
lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you 
out of this slump.

COURTNEY 
I just want to have a child. Just...two...
perfect...children...
(Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)

The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads 
"Barcadia."

INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT 

An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all 
polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths, 
minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.

A waiter has come to take their drink orders.

BATEMAN
J&B. Straight.

COURTNEY 
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with 
a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman 
leans over and pulls her back up.

COURTNEY 
Are we here?

BATEMAN 
Yes.

COURTNEY 
This is Dorsia?

BATEMAN 
(Examining a menu that says "Barcadia" in large script) 
Yes, dear.

Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and 
starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both 
shoulders and props her up.

BATEMAN 
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter 
soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine 
called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll 
love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and 
pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. 

COURTNEY 
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick. 

She falls asleep at the table.

INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on 
top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears 
it open with his teeth, puts it on.

COURTNEY 
(Dazed on lithium) 
I want you to fuck me.

Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.

COURTNEY 
Luis is a despicable twit.

BATEMAN 
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.

He keeps fucking her.

COURTNEY 
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" 
Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? 
Get off me.

BATEMAN 
Is it a what?

COURTNEY 
Pull out.

BATEMAN 
I'm ignoring you.

COURTNEY 
(screaming) 
Pull out, goddamnit!

BATEMAN 
(Slowing down but not stopping)
What do you want, Courtney?

She pushes him away from her.

BATEMAN 
It's a plain end. I think.

COURTNEY 
Turn the light on.

She tries to sit up.

BATEMAN 
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.

COURTNEY 
Patrick. Turn on the Light.
He turns on the light. 

BATEMAN 
It's a plain end, see? So? 

COURTNEY 
Take it off. 

BATEMAN 
Why? 

COURTNEY 
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip � 
(She covers herself with her comforter) 
to catch the force of the ejaculate! 
BATEMAN 
I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?

Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying. 

COURTNEY 
(Screaming) 
Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?

Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.

BATEMAN 
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, 
Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. 
(He slaps her again lightly) 
Why is it pulled down half an inch? 
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!

COURTNEY 
(Choking crying) 
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. 
I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.

BATEMAN 
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?

COURTNEY 
Oh God, just get it over with.

He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and 
falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their 
bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the 
ceiling.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY

Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in 
the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto 
a spectacular view of Manhattan.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a 
reservation there?

BATEMAN 
Lucky, I guess.

CARRUTHERS 
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, 
Valentino Couture?

BATEMAN 
Uh huh.

CARRUTHERS 
(Reaching out to touch it) 
It looks so soft.

BATEMAN 
(Catching Luis hand) 
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.

Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague 
on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal 
under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and 
self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.

OWEN 
(To Bateman) 
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?

BATEMAN 
I've been great. And you?

Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's 
thoughts.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam. 
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in 
fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a 
penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. 
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have 
a slightly better haircut.

During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS 
HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the 
opposite corner of the room. He bears a 
superficial resemblance to Bateman.

OWEN 
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?

BATEMAN 
(Nervous) 
It's...it's...all right.

OWEN 
Really? That's interesting. 
(He stares at Bateman, smiling)
Not great?

BATEMAN 
Oh well, you know.

OWEN 
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

BATEMAN 
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.

McDermott and Price enter.

McDERMOTT 
Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.

OWEN 
Thank you, Baxter.

PRICE 
Listen, Paul. Squash?

OWEN 
Call me. 
(Hands him a business card)

PRICE 
How about Friday?

OWEN 
No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea 
urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away 
and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.

PRICE
(Whispering) 
Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?

McDERMOTT (Whispering) 
I think he's lying.

Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card. 

PRICE 
(Suddenly enthused) 
What's that, a gram? 

BATEMAN 
New card. What do you think?

McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully. 

McDERMOTT 
Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.

He hands it to Van Patten.

BATEMAN 
Picked them up from the printers yesterday

VAN PATTEN 
Good coloring.

BATEMAN 
That's bone. And the lettering is something called 
Silian Rail.

McDERMOTT 
(Envious) 
Silian Rail?

VAN PATTEN 
It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.

He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the 
table. 

VAN PATTEN 
Look at this.

They all lean forward to inspect it. 

PRICE 
That's really nice.

Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to 
control his anxiety.

VAN PATTEN 
Eggshell with Romalian type. 
(Turning to Bateman)
What do you think?

BATEMAN 
(Barely able to breath, his voice a croak) 
Nice.

PRICE 
(Holding the card up to the light) 
Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so 
tasteful?

Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at 
McDermott's. 

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

PRICE 
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. 

He holds up his own card. 

PRICE 
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

BATEMAN 
(Choking with anxiety) 
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it 
up for their inspection: "PAUL OWEN, PIERCE & PIERCE, 
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS." Bateman swallows, speechless. 
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint 
heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness 
of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...

His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it 
until it fills the screen.

He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.

CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.

EXT. STREET- EVENING 

The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.

Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of 
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns 
to leave, he notices someone across the street.

A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open 
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A 
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM 
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies 
next to him.

He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green 
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.

BATEMAN 
(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.

The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.

BATEMAN 
You want some money?. Some...food?

The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches 
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his 
mind and holds out a $5 instead.

BATEMAN 
Is this what you need?

The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN 
It's cold out, too, isn't it?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN 
(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach) 
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you 
get a job?

HOMELESS MAN 
(Shivering and sobbing) 
I lost my job...

BATEMAN 
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? 
Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on 
the job?

HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.

BATEMAN 
Gee, uh, that's too bad.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

The dog starts to whimper.

BATEMAN 
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm not...

BATEMAN 
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm hungry

BATEMAN 
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. 
I'm trying to help you.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm hungry.

BATEMAN 
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who 
do have jobs? From people who do work?

HOMELESS MAN 
What am I gonna do?

BATEMAN 
Listen, what's your name?

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN 
Speak up. Come on.

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN 
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. 
That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. 
I'll help you.

HOMELESS MAN 
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
man. I can tell.

BATEMAN 
(Petting the dog) 
Shhhh...it's okay.

HOMELESS MAN 
(Grabbing Bateman's wrist) 
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.

BATEMAN 
(Stroking his face, whispering) 
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.

HOMELESS MAN 
I can't...I can't find a shelter

BATEMAN 
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? 
(Shouting)
Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of 
faggot. Al...I'm sorry.

Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.

BATEMAN 
It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common 
with you.

He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with 
a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to 
protect it.

BATEMAN 
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?

HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.

EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is 
silent.

LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.

BATEMAN
There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.

Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street. 
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the 
body left twitching on the ground.

INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY 

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a 
woman's hands rub cream into his face.

FACIALIST 
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So 
fine, so smooth...

His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he 
closes them again.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood, 
skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except 
for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside 
me and I don't know why.

CUT TO:

Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the 
MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his 
nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, 
on the verge of frenzy.

CUT TO:

Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning 
bed, wearing goggles.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an 
ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets, 
naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.

Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.

BATEMAN 
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?

MAITRE D'
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of 
ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.

OWEN 
No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro 
crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one 
could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the 
way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten 
people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of 
cilantro crawfish gumbo?

WAITER 
I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen 
earlier today, and-

BATEMAN 
J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer.

WAITER 
Would you like to hear-

OWEN 
Double Absolut martini.

WAITER 
Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?

BATEMAN 
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

The Waiter leaves.

OWEN 
This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam. 

This place is hot, very hot.

BATEMAN 
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous 
here.

OWEN 
Yeah, well, you're late.

BATEMAN 
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break 
(Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood) 
Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.

OWEN 
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.

BATEMAN 
Nobody goes there anymore.

There is a long disgruntled silence.

BATEMAN 
Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez 
Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana 
be at Texarkana?

Another pause.

BATEMAN 
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the 
Fisher account? How did you get it?

OWEN 
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have 
to kill you.

He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.

LATER: 
Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.

BATEMAN 
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?

Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another 
drink.

OWEN 
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?

BATEMAN Salon.

OWEN 
I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.

Bateman nods, agitated.

OWEN 
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

BATEMAN 
Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think 
she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.

OWEN 
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick 
Bateman. What a dork.

BATEMAN 
Another Martini, Paul?

Owen nods drunkenly.

LATER:

The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the 
table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid 
down.

BATEMAN 
(Talking to Owen like a child) 
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

BATEMAN 
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave 
a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?

OWEN 
No, man. I'm gonna bail.

BATEMAN 
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. 
(Helping him into his jacket) 
I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a 
bottle of Absolut waiting for us.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The living room floor has been meticulously covered with 
newspaper.

Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass 
in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.

BATEMAN 
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

OWEN 
They're okay.
BATEMAN 
Their early work was a little too New Wave for my 
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really 
came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
shower. He takes two Valium.

BATEMAN 
(Said partly from the bathroom) 
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of 
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. 
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen 
from behind ail the time.

BATEMAN 
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think 
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys 
catalogue.

OWEN 
Hey, Halberstam?

BATEMAN 
Yes, Owen?

OWEN 
Why are there copies of the Style section all over 
the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?

BATEMAN 
No, Owen.

OWEN 
(Confused) 
Is that a raincoat?

BATEMAN 
Yes, it is.

Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its 
case and slides it in the machine.

BATEMAN 
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most 
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is 
"HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably 
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not 
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of 
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.

Bateman puts on "Hip To Be Square."

BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.

We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the 
ax raised over his head.

BATEMAN 
Hey, Paul?

As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing 
the ax toward his face.

Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.

FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.

Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame. 
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.

Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.

BATEMAN 
(Raising the ax and screaming) 
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking 
stupid bastard!

LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the 
ax.

OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.

BATEMAN 
(Panting) 
Fucking bastard...

Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the 
coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly 
over the back of a chair.

He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He 
checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.

OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.

INT. LOBBY - NIGHT 

BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby, 
past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his 
feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN 
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

CARRUTHERS 
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good 
friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to 
Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it. 
(Looking down at the body) 
Where did you get your overnight bag?

BATEMAN 
Commes des Garcon.

A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get 
Owen's body into the backseat.

Bateman gets into the cab.

CARRUTHERS 
Call me please, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
Jesus lives, Luis.

INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT 

A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank 
except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.

Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in 
a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the 
body dissolve.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very 
similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls 
are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting 
on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale 
scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.

BATEMAN 
Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?

He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing 
toiletries and shoving them in.

BATEMAN 
Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.

He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans 
over the answering machine.

He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.

BATEMAN 
Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London 
for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. 
Hasta la vista, baby.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING 

Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of 
Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing 
Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes 
the Walkman off.

BATEMAN 
(Faintly irritable) 
What is it?

JEAN 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
(Condescendingly) 
Ye-es, Je-an?

JEAN 
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.

BATEMAN 
Who?

JEAN 
Detective Donald KIMBALL?

Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the 
drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back 
cover of Sports Illustrated.

BATEMAN 
Tell him I'm at lunch.

JEAN 
(whispering) 
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. 
It's only ten-thirty. 

Silence. 

BATEMAN 
Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless 
phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.

BATEMAN 
Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion 
to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good 
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt 
calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...

The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD 
KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age - 
and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of 
the type Bateman and his friends might wear.

Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a 
self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to 
carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at 
him curiously, noticing the silence.

BATEMAN 
(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him) 
Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.

Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in 
exasperation. 

KIMBALL nods understandingly.

BATEMAN 
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just 
walked in...
(He laughs inanely) 
Just joking...
(Pause) 
No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, 
right, got it. 
(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in) 
Sorry about that.

KIMBALL 
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. 
(Gesturing toward the phone) 
Was that anything important?

BATEMAN 
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. 
Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...
Spreading gossip.

They laugh politely.

KIMBALL 
(Holding out his hand) 
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL

BATEMAN 
(Shaking firmly) 
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

KIMBALL 
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed 
to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, 
you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.

KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports 
Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk. 
Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines 
into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is 
still running.

BATEMAN 
(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed) 
So, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL 
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate 
the disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?

KIMBALL 
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.

BATEMAN 
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.

KIMBALL 
So it's nothing that official. I just have some 
basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-

BATEMAN 
Coffee?

KIMBALL 
No. I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
Perrier? San Pellegrino?

KIMBALL 
No, I'm okay.

KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold 
Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes 
Jean.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Can you bring Mr...

KIMBALL 
KIMBALL.

BATEMAN 
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-

KIMBALL 
Oh no, I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
It's no problem

Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down 
in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters 
and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched 
glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman. 
He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.

BATEMAN 
Well, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL 
The disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the 
disappearance or anything...
(Trying to laugh) 
Not on "Page Six" at least.

KIMBALL 
I think his family wants this kept quiet.

BATEMAN 
Understandable. 
(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino) 
Lime?

KIMBALL 
No, really. I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
You sure? I can always get you a lime.

A pause.

KIMBALL
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own 
files, okay?

BATEMAN 
Shoot.

KIMBALL 
How old are you?

BATEMAN 
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

KIMBALL 
(Scribbling in his notebook) 
Where did you go to school?

BATEMAN 
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

KIMBALL 
Your address?

BATEMAN 
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American
Gardens Building.

KIMBALL 
(Looking up, impressed) 
Nice. Very nice.

BATEMAN 
(Flattered) 
Thanks.

A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his
eyes, as if in pain.

KIMBALL 
Pardon me, but are you okay?

BATEMAN 
Who do you ask?

KIMBALL
You seem...nervous.

Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a 
bottle of aspirin.

BATEMAN 
Nuprin?

KIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.

Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the 
desk.

BATEMAN 
Bad habit.

KIMBALL 
I know. I'm sorry.

A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.

KIMBALL 
Would you rather I not smoke?

BATEMAN 
No, I guess it's okay.

KIMBALL 
You sure?

BATEMAN 
No problem. 
(Buzzing Jean)

JEAN (O.S.) 
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.
She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

KIMBALL 
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?

BATEMAN 
Well...

He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows 
them dry.

KIMBALL 
How well did you know him?

BATEMAN 
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, 
you know.

KIMBALL 
Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Yeah...Yale thing.

KIMBALL 
What do you mean...Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet 
homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.

A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner 
becomes deafening.

KIMBALL 
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul 
Owen?

BATEMAN 
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...
ate a balanced diet.

KIMBALL 
What kind of man was he? Besides...
(He hesitates tries to smile) 
the information you've just given.

BATEMAN 
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

KIMBALL 
Do you feel that way?

BATEMAN 
No. Not really.

KIMBALL 
(As he writes without looking up) 
Where did Paul hang out?

BATEMAN 
Hang...out?

KIMBALL 
Yeah. You know...hang out.

BATEMAN 
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.
Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular 
places.

KIMBALL 
He had a yacht?

BATEMAN 
No, he just hung out there.

KIMBALL 
And where did he go to school?

A slight pause.

BATEMAN 
Don't you know this?

KIMBALL 
I just wanted to know if you know.
BATEMAN 
Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...
Listen, I just...I just want to help.

KIMBALL 
I understand.

He makes another note.

KIMBALL 
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?

BATEMAN 
We were both seven in 1969.

KIMBALL 
(Smiles) 
So was I.

BATEMAN 
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

KIMBALL 
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he 
went to London.

BATEMAN 
Well, maybe he did, huh?

KIMBALL 
His girlfriend doesn't think so.

BATEMAN 
But...has anyone seen him in London?

KIMBALL 
Actually, yes.

BATEMAN 
Hmmm.

KIMBALL 
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. 
A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but 
I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert 
Ainsworth for Paul, so...

BATEMAN 
Oh.

KIMBALL 
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan
worship?

BATEMAN 
What?

KIMBALL 
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I 
know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't 
know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was 
recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano 
girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-

BATEMAN 
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced 
diet and-

KIMBALL 
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.

A pause - the longest so far.

BATEMAN 
Have you consulted a psychic?

KIMBALL 
No.

BATEMAN 
Had his apartment been burglarized?

KIMBALL 
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A 
suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

BATEMAN 
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet 
or anything, right?

KIMBALL 
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...
basically no one has seen or heard anything.

BATEMAN 
That's so typical, isn't it?

KIMBALL 
It's just strange. 
(He stares out the window, lost in thought) 
One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, 
and then...

BATEMAN 
Nothing.

KIMBALL 
People just...disappear.

BATEMAN 
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
(He checks his Rolex)

KIMBALL 
Eerie. Really eerie.

Silence.

BATEMAN 
(Standing up) 
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting 
with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.

KIMBALL 
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I 
mean aren't you going to be late?

BATEMAN 
Uh, no. There's one...down here.

KIMBALL 
Oh really? I didn't know that.

Bateman leads him to the door.

BATEMAN 
Yes. It's very good.

KIMBALL turns to face him.

KIMBALL 
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information 
at all...

BATEMAN 
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.

KIMBALL 
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.

Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his 
eyes and leans against the door, sweating.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 

A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian, 
a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect 
green grapes, a few berries.

OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard 
from the living room.

The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal 
crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw 
Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table, 
next to a copy of GQ.

LATER:

Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand, 
jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.

BATEMAN 
You like that, slut?

The person on the other end clearly hangs up.

CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.

BATEMAN 
You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar 
boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white 
cotton T-shirt by 
Commes des Garcons. 
(He snorts like a pig) 
My Rolex cost-

Another hang-up. He dials again.

BATEMAN 
(Whipering) 
I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do 
you think of that? 
(Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts) 
Huh, bitch?

GIRL (O.S.)
Dad, is that you?

Bateman hangs up, frustrated.

EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 

Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside 
CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket. 
Bateman opens his window to speak to her.

BATEMAN 
I haven't seen you around here.

CHRISTIE 
You just haven't been looking.

BATEMAN 
Would you like to see my apartment?

Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a 
tuxedo.

CHRISTIE 
(looking away to some dark corner) 
I'm not supposed to.

Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now 
notices, then takes.

BATEMAN 
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?

CHRISTIE 
I'm not supposed to. 
(She pockets the bill) 
But I can make an exception.

BATEMAN 
Do you take American Express?

Christie is still looking out behind her.

BATEMAN 
Do you take American Express?

Christie looks at him like he's crazy.

BATEMAN 
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He 
reads off a credit card number.

BATEMAN 
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does 
couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the 
American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really 
can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.

He hangs up.

BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that? 
You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is 
that clear?

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white 
milky bath oil.

BATEMAN 
That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.

Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and 
Bateman is casually touching her breast.

BATEMAN 
I want you to clean your vagina.

Christie reaches for a washcloth.

BATEMAN 
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN 
I want to watch. You have a very nice body.

The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.

BATEMAN 
Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry 
off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and 
our guest in the living room for drinks.

Bateman answers the door.

BATEMAN 
You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat. 
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes 
her coat and inspects her body and face.

BATEMAN 
Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm 
going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.

Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a 
glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the 
couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a 
long silence.

BATEMAN 
So, don't you want to know what I do?

The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles. 
Christie shrugs.

CHRISTIE 
No.

SABRINA 
(Smiling) 
No, not really.

Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.

BATEMAN 
Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce. 
(Long pause) 
Have you heard of it?

Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands 
up and goes over to the CD collection.

CHRISTIE 
You have a really nice place here...Paul. 
How much did you pay for it?

BATEMAN 
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, 
hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a 
pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.

BATEMAN 
No, no smoking. Not in here.

He walks over to Christie.

BATEMAN 
Varda truffle?

Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina 
takes one.

BATEMAN 
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very 
fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.

Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection. 
He takes one out and examines it.

BATEMAN 
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis 
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before 
that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too 
artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' 
presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out 
another one.

BATEMAN 
I think "Invisible Touch" is the group's undisputed
masterpiece.

He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him 
into the bedroom.

BATEMAN 
It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the 
same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding 
three albums. Christie, take off the robe.

Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to 
put it on.

BATEMAN 
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, 
Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance 
of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.

Bateman starts to undress.

BATEMAN 
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer 
songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. 
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.

BATEMAN 
Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion." In this 
song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political 
authority.

Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather 
menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves. 

BATEMAN 
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about 
monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. 
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything 
I've heard in rock.

He turns on the video camera. 

BATEMAN 
Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your 
asshole.

Bateman looks through the viewfinder.

BATEMAN 
Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and 
therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially 
songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against 
All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. 

He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in 
the CD.

BATEMAN 
But I also think that Phill Collins works better 
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and 
I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio," a great, 
great song, a personal favorite.

SEX MONTAGE CUT TO "Sussudio." We see this in WIDE SHOT, or 
through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.

CUT TO: 

Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina 
on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his 
wrist. Bateman's eyes open.

BATEMAN 
Don't touch the Rolex.

Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.

He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger, 
a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns 
around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up 
and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.

BATEMAN 
We're not through yet...

CUT TO:

Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They 
are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a 
deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the 
b.g. Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is playing.

INT. YALE CLUB � DAY
 
McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are 
having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and 
gives them the finger.

BATEMAN 
What an asshole.

McDERMOTT 
Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a 
fucking drug addict. No self-control.

VAN PATTEN 
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do 
you think, Bateman?

BATEMAN 
I know her. I knew her.

McDERMOTT 
Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it 
like that?

VAN PATTEN 
Because he dated her.

BATEMAN 
How did you guess?

VAN PATTEN 
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, 
Bateman.

BATEMAN 
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy 
personality.

McDERMOTT 
So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a 
babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other 
reason.

VAN PATTEN 
If they have a good personality, then something 
is very wrong.

McDERMOTT 
If they have a good personality and they are not 
great looking-who fucking cares?

BATEMAN 
Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if 
they have a good personality? 
(He smiles giving up) 
I know, I know-

ALL IN UNISON
There are no girls with good personalities! 
(They laugh and high-five each other)

VAN PATTEN 
A good personality consists of a chick with a 
little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without 
being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep 
her dumb fucking mouth 
shut.

McDERMOTT 
Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are
smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even 
talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly 
chicks.

VAN PATTEN 
Absolutely.

McDERMOTT 
And this is because they have to make up for how 
fucking unattractive they are.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

VAN PATTEN 
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

BATEMAN 
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was 
an interesting guy.

McDERMOTT 
So what did Ed say?

BATEMAN 
He said, "When I see a pretty girl walking down the 
street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her 
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat 
her right."

Pauses, finishes his drink.

McDERMOTT 
What does the other part of him think?

BATEMAN 
What her head would look like on a stick.

McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back 
at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
join In.

Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.

CARRUTHERS 
(Shyly) 
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.

McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.

McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you 
know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to 
get a new one too.

He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone 
compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear 
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously. 
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with 
himself.

VAN PATTEN 
Listen, what about dinner?

BATEMAN 
(Suddenly angry) 
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about 
fucking dinner?" 

McDERMOTT 
Ah, cheer up, Bateman. 
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck) 
What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning? 

BATEMAN 
(Watching Luis going into the men's room) 
Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.

McDERMOTT 
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.

BATEMAN 
Excuse me.

He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van 
Patten grabs a waiter.

VAN PATTEN 
Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring 
me an Evian or something, okay?

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY 

Bateman pulls on his gloves as he 
enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his 
back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman 
approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands 
up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his 
neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear 
is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to 
squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.

Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in 
thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's 
wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck 
expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side 
of his face.

CARRUTHERS 
God, Patrick. Why here?

He strokes Bateman's hair.

CARRUTHERS 
I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.

Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs 
away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers 
immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops 
them again.

CARRUTHERS 
Don't be shy.

Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift 
his hands again, but abandons the attempt.

CARRUTHERS 
You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas 
party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that 
red-striped paisley Armani tie.

Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are 
still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and 
stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he 
realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up 
behind him.

CARRUTHERS 
I want you. I want you...too.

Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter 
and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d' 
and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely, 
Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at 
them. Carruthers walks up behind him.

BATEMAN 
(Hissing) 
What...is...it?

CARRUTHERS 
Where are you going?

BATEMAN 
(Stumbling away from him) 
I've gotta...I've 
gotta...return some videotapes.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
What?
CARRUTHERS 
(Silently mouthing the words) 
I'll call you.

Bateman storms out of the restaurant.

INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex. 
Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels 
something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy, 
a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.

COURTNEY 
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?

BATEMAN 
Maybe.

Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her 
nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins 
to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches 
the TV at low volume.

COURTNEY 
What are you doing tonight?

BATEMAN 
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

COURTNEY 
That's nice.

BATEMAN 
You and...Luis?

COURTNEY 
(Lighting a cigarette) 
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and 
Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...

BATEMAN 
I never knew you smoked.

COURTNEY 
(Smiling sadly) 
You never noticed.

Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.

COURTNEY 
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?

BATEMAN 
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're 
going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

COURTNEY 
(Sarcastically) 
Isn't that special? 
(A pause) 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Yes, Courtney?

C0URTNEY 
If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?

BATEMAN 
(Flatly) 
You too.

Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its 
head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.

COURTNEY 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Yes?

COURTNEY 
Nothing.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 

A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop 
kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.

I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and 
tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a 
suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.

KIMBALL 
Mr. Bateman?

Bateman gasps and recovers.

BATEMAN 
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell?
KIMBALL 
Kimball. 
(Extending his hand) 
Call me Don.

BATEMAN 
Don.

KIMBALL 
So...you hang out here a lot?

BATEMAN 
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You 
know.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone 
in for "formal questioning?" (He makes quotation marks 
in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)

KIMBALL 
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?

BATEMAN 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

KIMBALL 
(Looking at his glass) 
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much 
more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, 
don't you think?

Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.

KIMBALL 
Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?

Bateman shakes his head.

KIMBALL 
I mean they want to get caught.

BATEMAN 
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need 
anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean 
Owen was a...complex man.

Bateman wanders away.

He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from 
the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.

BATEMAN 
(Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!

The man stares at him.

BATEMAN 
I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...

The man walks by, shaking his head.

Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a 
more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in 
black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott 
and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black 
mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered 
argument.

PRICE 
I have to talk to these girls? They're models.

McDERMOTT 
Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder. 
You went last time. Stay here.

McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring 
into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to 
unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.

PRICE 
(Clapping his hands together) 
Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?

Silence.

LIBBY 
Where did Craig go?

PRICE 
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to 
sign a peace treaty with him between the United States 
and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.

LIBBY 
Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.

PRICE 
You're not confused, are you?

LIBBY 
No, not really.

CARON 
Gorbachev's not downstairs.

DAISY 
(Smiling) 
Are you Iying?

PRICE 
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's 
at Tunnel.

BATEMAN 
(To Daisy) 
Ask me a question.

DAISY 
So, what do you do?

BATEMAN 
What do you think I do?

DAISY 
A model? An actor?

BATEMAN 
No. Flattering, but no.

DAISY 
Well...

BATEMAN 
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.

DAISY (Unfazed) 
Do you like it?

BATEMAN 
Welt...it depends, why?

DAISY 
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and 
acquisitions don't really like it.

Silence.

BATEMAN 
So, where do you work out?

MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING: 

The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a 
balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him 
in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over 
the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman 
is reaching for him.

PRICE 
(Shouting)
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

BATEMAN 
Leaving what?

PRICE 
This.

Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his 
drink.

BATEMAN 
Don't, I'll drink it.

PRICE 
(Screaming) 
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.

BATEMAN 
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?

PRICE 
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!

BATEMAN 
Don't tell me...merchant banking?

PRICE 
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm 
disappearing.

BATEMAN 
(laughing) 
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?

Price looks away.

McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.

McDERMOTT 
Hey-don't worry, be happy.

Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is 
shouting something that can't be heard, then

PRICE 
Goodbye! Fuckheads!

He climbs over the railing.

DAISY What is he doing?

BATEMAN 
Price! Come back!

Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment 
then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT 
Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.

DAISY 
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays 
in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand 
what I was doing with a yuppie.

BATEMAN 
Oh really?
DAISY 
He said...
(She laughs) 
He said you gave him bad vibes.

BATEMAN 
That's...that's too bad.

DAISY 
You think I'm dumb, don't you?

BATEMAN 
What?

DAISY 
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

BATEMAN 
(insincerely) No. I really don't.

DAISY 
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.

She takes his hand as they get into a cab.

INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT 

Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses 
in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the 
case.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 

Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York 
Times crossword puzzle at dusk.

Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with 
a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.

JEAN 
Doin' the crossword?

Bateman nods without looking up.

JEAN 
Need help?

BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the 
puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean 
drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.

BATEMAN 
Jean?

JEAN 
(Re-enters office) 
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?

He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.

BATEMAN 
That is...if you're not doing anything.

JEAN 
Oh no. I have no plans.

BATEMAN 
(Lowering his Wayfarers) 
Well, isn't this a coincidence.

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Listen, where should we go?

He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.

JEAN 
Anywhere you want?

BATEMAN 
Let's not think about what I want. How about 
anywhere you want.

JEAN 
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.

BATEMAN 
No, come on. Anywhere you want.

JEAN 
Oh, I can't. 
(Sighs) 
I don't know.

BATEMAN 
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want.
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

A long pause.

JEAN 
What about...Dorsia?

Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles 
at her.

BATEMAN 
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...

JEAN 
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.

BATEMAN 
Dorsia is...fine.

He dials the number.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia, yes?

BATEMAN 
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at 
nine o'clock?

He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean.

MAITRE D'
We are totally booked.

BATEMAN 
Oh really? That's great.

MAITRE D' 
I said we are totally booked.

BATEMAN 
Two at nine? Perfect.

MAITRE D' 
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is 
also totally booked.

BATEMAN 
See you then.

He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He 
glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the 
desk, confused.

BATEMAN 
Yes? You're dressed...okay.

JEAN 
You didn't give them a name.

BATEMAN 
They know me.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock 
for drinks, okay?

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING 

Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out.

JEAN 
Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.

Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady 
visible.

BATEMAN 
Jean? Sorbet?

JEAN 
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in 
his hand and hands her the sorbet.

Jean is eating the sorbet.

JEAN 
Want a bite?

BATEMAN 
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

JEAN 
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? 
You look great. Very fit.

BATEMAN 
(Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness) 
You can always he thinner. Look...better.

JEAN 
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't 
want to ruin your willpower.

BATEMAN 
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling 
it anyway.

Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up 
his knife drawer, looking at the knives.

BATEMAN 
So listen, what do you really want to do with your 
life?

Pause.

BATEMAN 
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, 
okay?

JEAN 
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, 
but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life 
where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so...
I don't know...unsure.

Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge 
of the blade.

BATEMAN 
Do you have a boyfriend?

JEAN 
No, not really.

BATEMAN 
Interesting.

JEAN 
(Shyly) 
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

BATEMAN 
Maybe. I don't know Not really.
Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very 
Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly
ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, 
twine and a nail gun.

BATEMAN 
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?

JEAN 
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused 
on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about 
changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.

BATEMAN 
Growing. I'm glad you said that.

Bateman picks up the duct tape.

BATEMAN 
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, 
was named Lassie? Had you heard this?

JEAN 
Who's Ted Bundy?

BATEMAN 
Forget it.

JEAN 
What's that?

BATEMAN 
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for...
taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the 
nail gun.

JEAN 
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?

Jean puts her spoon down on the table.

BATEMAN 
(Looking up from loading nails into the gun) 
What...No! Put it in the carton.

JEAN 
Sorry. 
(She puts the spoon in the carton)

BATEMAN 
Jean? What?

JEAN 
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and
stands behind the couch.

BATEMAN 
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just 
want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

JEAN 
Hmmmm. 

He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head.
The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun 
behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman 
listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch. 
He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she 
listens to the message.

EVELYN 
Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy. 
What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope 
you're not out with some little number you picked up because 
you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never 
called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for 
Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with 
Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar, 
auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell 
Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps! 
You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.

Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.

JEAN 
Was that...Evelyn?

Silence.

JEAN 
Are you still seeing her?

Silence.

JEAN 
I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.

Silence.

JEAN 
Do you want me to go?

A long pause.

BATEMAN 
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.

JEAN 
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get 
involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you 
want me to go?

Another long pause.

BATEMAN 
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I 
think I might hurt you. 
(Almost hopefully) 
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

JEAN 
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. 
You're right, I should go.

She gets up to leave.

JEAN 
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with 
Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.

BATEMAN 
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.

He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY 

Bateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside 
the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with 
Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for 
a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting 
the door behind him.

BATEMAN 
Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come 
into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

Jean looks flustered.

Kimball follows Bateman into his office.

KIMBALL 
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's 
taken a leave of absence.

BATEMAN 
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. 
(Hopefully) 
Is he a suspect?

KIMBALL 
Not really.

A pause.

KIMBALL 
Do you remember where you were on the night of 
Paul's disappearance? 
(He checks his notebook) 
Which was on the twentieth of December?

BATEMAN 
God...I guess...I was probably returning 
videotapes.

He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his 
diary.

BATEMAN 
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

KIMBALL 
Wait. That's not what I've got.

BATEMAN 
What?

KIMBALL 
That's not the information I've received.

BATEMAN 
Well...I...Wait...What information have 
you received?

KIMBALL 
Let's see...
(He flips through his notebook) 
That you were with-

BATEMAN 
Well, I could he wrong.

KIMBALL 
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?

BATEMAN 
(Clearly nervous and under pressure) 
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It 
was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner 
at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I 
physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't 
remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.

Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens 
his briefcase to put away his notebook.

KIMBALL 
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

BATEMAN 
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long 
day-a bit scattered.

KIMBALL 
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch 
in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?

BATEMAN 
Great, yes, I'd like that.

KIMBALL 
And if you could try and pin down where you were 
the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a 
lot easier.

BATEMAN 
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a 
new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.

KIMBALL 
Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I 
just bought it on my way here.

Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.

BATEMAN 
Never. I mean...I don't really like...
singers.

KIMBALL 
Not a big music fan, eh?

BATEMAN 
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too...
black sounding. For me.

KIMBALL 
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll 
call your secretary about reservations.

BATEMAN 
I'll be there.

EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before. 
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a 
half-opened window.

CHRISTIE 
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after 
last time...

BATEMAN 
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.

CHRISTIE 
I don't think so.

He hands her a $500 bill.

BATEMAN 
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. 

The driver's here, you'll be safe.

Christie gets in hesitantly.

BATEMAN 
Nothing like last time, promise.

CHRISTIE 
Alright.

He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.

BATEMAN 
(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party) 
So, you're looking great, how have you been?

CHRISTIE 
(A little confused) 
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

BATEMAN 
(Mock shock) 
Really?

CHRISTIE 
My friend told me I should maybe even get a 
lawyer.

BATEMAN 
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.

He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to 
her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets 
quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.

BATEMAN 
Bitch.

He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge 
wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to 
lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the 
limo, she reaches for the money.

He snatches it away.

BATEMAN 
Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.

She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.

BATEMAN 
Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine, 
Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. 
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything 
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?

Christie nods.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped 
down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an 
attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally. 
Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to 
examine a CD.

ELIZABETH 
You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?

Christie shakes her head.

The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and 
putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth 
is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.

ELIZABETH 
I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?

Christie looks blank.

ELIZABETH 
Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.

Christie still blank.

ELIZABETH 
You know, Au Bar?

Christie shakes her head.

ELIZABETH 
Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth
day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.

Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses.
Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at 
the floor. There is an awkward silence.

CHRISTIE 
This is nicer than your other apartment.

BATEMAN 
(Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment) 
It's not that nice.

Silence.

CHRISTIE 
Where did you two meet?

ELIZABETH 
Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no, 
'87, and...
(Turning to Patrick) 
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole. 
(Sarcastically) 
Hot number.

BATEMAN 
What do you mean, she was a hot number.

ELIZABETH 
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob. 
(To Christie) 
Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need
I say more?...What do you do?

A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor. 

BATEMAN 
She's my...cousin. 

ELIZABETH 
(Skeptically) 
Uh huh? 

BATEMAN
She's from...France.

A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously. 

ELIZABETH 
Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.

Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares 
At Christie while she waits for someone to answer. 

ELIZABETH 
Where do you summer? Southampton?

Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.

CHRISTIE 
No.

ELIZABETH 
(Listening to the receiver) 
Oh God, it's his machine.

BATEMAN 
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.

ELIZABETH 
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.

BATEMAN 
Don't tell him you're here.

ELIZABETH 
Why would I?

Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the
whole glass, making a face.

ELIZABETH 
This tastes weird. 
(She examines the label and shrugs)
Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway 
you'd like. I'm at-

BATEMAN 
(Whispering) 
You're at Paul Owen s.

ELIZABETH 
Who?

BATEMAN 
(Whispering) 
Paul Owen.

ELIZABETH 
I want the number, idiot. 
(She waves him away and continues into the reciever) 
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I 
don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my 
hairdresser on you.

She hangs up.

ELIZABETH 
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce 
& Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?

BATEMAN 
No.

ELIZABETH 
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.

Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her 
another glass of the drugged wine.

BATEMAN 
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. 
What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.

ELIZABETH 
(Laughing) 
Patrick, you re a lunatic.

BATEMAN 
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?

ELIZABETH 
Let's not get lewd. 
(Flirty) 
I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

BATEMAN 
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.

ELIZABETH 
(To Christie) 
Does he do this all the time?

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN 
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.

BATEMAN 
(To Elizabeth) 
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

ELIZABETH 
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?

BATEMAN 
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

ELIZABETH 
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me 
feel weird.

LATER:

Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making 
out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD, 
showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.

BATEMAN 
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP 
called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles 
on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps 
across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's 
mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album 
on a first listening.

ELIZABETH 
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You 
actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.

BATEMAN 
(Ignoring her) 
It's hard to choose a favorite track 
among so many great ones, but "The Greatest Love of All" 
is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about 
self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message 
crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope 
that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. 
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in 
to empathize with others, we can always empathize with 
ourselves.

As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD 
in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and 
watches it slide into the machine.

BATEMAN 
It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's 
beautifully stated on the album.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER 

AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and 
Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.

CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by 
the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an 
incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are 
moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against 
flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are 
shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional 
performance, turning her head every so often to check the 
progress of her partners.

OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure, 
moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then 
shifts to actual pain.

Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind 
Christie. There is blood on his face.

Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps 
off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the 
mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split 
second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.

We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.

Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening 
doors, looking for an escape.

She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.

She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the 
door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams, 
then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE 
DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.

She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by 
the light from a television set. Through the darkness she 
sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.

She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the 
main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then 
runs.

Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw, 
spattered with blood.

Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at 
her, bellowing.

They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom. 
Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the 
bathtub.

Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.

Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He 
tries to bite it.

She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the 
front door.

He runs after her.

BATEMAN 
Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you 
piece of bitch trash!

Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.

Bateman runs after her.

She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.

She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the 
buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.

Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.

She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her. 
He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims 
the chainsaw at her and drops it.

Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.

FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown 
at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of 
her back like a sword.

INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING 

An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper 
tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary 
colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.

Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on 
the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the 
chainsaw in her back.

EVELYN 
I want a firm commitment.

BATEMAN 
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.

Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.

EVELYN 
(Distracted) 
Why? What's wrong?

BATEMAN 
(Speaking very carefully, measuring each word) 
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale 
cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill 
my needs.

The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a
new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.

BATEMAN 
We need to talk.

EVELYN 
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk 
about?

BATEMAN 
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over

EVELYN 
(Motioning to the waiter for water) 
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just 
avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?

BATEMAN 
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This 
is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

EVELYN 
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your 
friends. I don't think it would work. 
(Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin) 
You have a little something on your upper lip.

BATEMAN 
(Brushing her hand away) 
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about 
that. You can have them.

Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a 
realization dawning.

EVELYN 
You're really serious, aren't you?

BATEMAN 
Yes, I am.

EVELYN 
But what about the past? Our past?

BATEMAN 
We never really shared one.

EVELYN 
You're inhuman.

BATEMAN 
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. 
(He pauses, as if searching for the right words) 
You're just not terribly important to me.

Evelyn begins to cry.

EVELYN 
No, no, no.

BATEMAN 
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

She reaches desperately across the table and takes his 
hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.

EVELYN 
(Sobbing) 
What do you want me to do, what is it you want?

The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is
becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.

BATEMAN 
(Looking uncomfortably around the room) 
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making 
this scene right now.

EVELYN 
Oh God, I can't believe this.

BATEMAN 
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.

Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the 
tears so they will not affect her make-up.

EVELYN 
(Surprisingly calm) 
Where are you going?

BATEMAN 
I'm just leaving.

EVELYN 
But where?

BATEMAN 
I have to return some videotapes.

He rushes out of the room.

EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING 

Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.

BATEMAN 
Here kitty, kitty.

The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and 
walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in 
the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the 
deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He 
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the 
kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.

WOMAN 
Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?

Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming 
to the floor.

Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the 
distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car 
screeches after him.

COP CAR (O.S.)
HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.

Bateman ducks down an alley.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 

A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from 
out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away 
from him.

Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of 
them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He 
reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.

He runs out of the alley.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
approaching.

COP CAR 
Halt. Put down your weapon.

The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air. 
Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.

Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the 
police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light 
up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living 
and dead.

NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows 
him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each 
one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.

NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a 
tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches, 
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 

He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.

NIGHT WATCHMAN 
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You 
forgot to sign in.

Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the 
revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he 
notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He 
revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.

NEW ANGLE: 

He runs out of the building and across the 
street to an identical office building, the one that houses 
Pierce & Pierce.

INT. PIERCE & PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT 

Bateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs 
in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close 
behind him.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 

Bateman stands looking out 
through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view 
of the city and the river.

Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the 
opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares 
everywhere, distant sirens.

Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened, 
he drops to the floor behind his desk.

Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating 
Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.

He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into 
the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.

BATEMAN 
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my 
lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of 
people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some 
homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in 
Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin' 
Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail 
gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I 
killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost 
got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I 
can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed 
Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving 
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything 
out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes 
of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...
well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. 
Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not 
sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess 
I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show 
up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.

Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight 
circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises 
up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the 
sky.

INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY 

KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.

KIMBALL 
(Very surprised) 
No hash browns? 

BATEMAN 
Not in the mood, I guess.

KIMBALL 
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I 
mean- it's-have you been here before?

BATEMAN 
(Deliberately nonchalant) 
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...
ordering them.

KIMBALL 
(Looking at him like he's nuts) 
Suit yourself, I guess.

Pause.

KIMBALL 
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on 
what you did?

BATEMAN 
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some 
sorbet?

KIMBALL 
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

BATEMAN 
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?

KIMBALL 
According to his date book, and this was verified by his 
secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.

BATEMAN 
And?

KIMBALL 
I've questioned him.

BATEMAN 
Marcus?

KIMBALL 
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't 
be sure.

BATEMAN 
But Marcus denied it?

KIMBALL 
Yes.

BATEMAN 
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

KIMBALL 
Yes.

A pause.

BATEMAN 
He does? You're sure?

KIMBALL 
(smiling)
I checked it out. It's clean.

BATEMAN 
Oh.
KIMBALL Now where were you? 
(He laughs) 

BATEMAN 
(Laughing with him) 
Where was Marcus? 

KIMBALL 
He wasn't with Paul 
Owen. 

BATEMAN 
So who was he with? 

KIMBALL 
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, 
Harry Newman, George Butner and � 
(He pauses, Then looks up) 
- you.

A moment of stunned silence.

BATEMAN 
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen 
to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner 
with Victoria...the following night. 

KIMBALL 
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for 
a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. 
Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or 
later. 
(A pause) 
I mean, to think that one of his friends 
killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too 
ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? 

McDermott stops by the table. 

McDERMOTT 
KIMBALL! How's the investigation? 
Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says. 
(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back) 
Bateman, what's wrong with ,you? 

Bateman looks at him in silence, 
panicking. 

McDERMOTT 
You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky 
without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a 
raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long. 
(He wanders off muttering) 
No fucking hash browns...

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He 
has a surgical mask in one hand.

DOORMAN 
What can I do for you, sir?

BATEMAN 
20B.

DOORMAN 
Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.

BATEMAN 
Mrs. Wolfe?

DOORMAN 
The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
don't you?

Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly 
painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English 
country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There 
are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands 
admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman 
wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops 
at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He 
opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs. 
Wolfe approaches, smiling.

MRS. WOLFE 
Are you my two o'clock?

BATEMAN 
No.

Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the 
surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.

MRS. WOLFE 
Can I help you?

BATEMAN
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

She stares at him impassively.

BATEMAN 
Doesn't he live here?

MRS. WOLFE 
No, he doesn't.

BATEMAN 
Are you sure?

MRS. WOLFE 
You saw the ad in the Times?

BATEMAN 
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...
doesn't Paul Owen still live here?

MRS. WOLFE 
There was no ad in the Times.

Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.

MRS. WOLFE 
I think you should go now.

BATEMAN 
But I think...I want to know what happened 
here.

MRS. WOLFE 
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.

Bateman backs away slowly.

MRS. WOLFE 
Don't come back.

BATEMAN 
I won't...don't worry.

Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall, 
rattled, and gets into the elevator.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 

Bateman enters the revolving 
door of an office building, panicking and breathing 
heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks 
deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes 
out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY 
just like him.

GUY 
Hey, Kinsley.

Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.

GUY 
See you at Fluties, okay?

The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down 
the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage 
cans, etc.

EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY 

Bateman searches his pockets 
for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows 
them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his 
face, dialing a number.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick Bateman's office.

BATEMAN 
Jean? Hello? Jean?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN 
Hello? Jean, I need help!

JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you?

BATEMAN 
Jean-I'm not-

JEAN (O.S.) 
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and 
David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.

BATEMAN 
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick? I can't hear you.

BATEMAN 
What are I doing?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?

BATEMAN 
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
...to the office this afternoon.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Why?

BATEMAN 
(Screaming) 
Just...say...no!

JEAN (O.S.) 
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?

BATEMAN 
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!

He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck 
into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his 
jacket.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY 

Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens 
his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING 

Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the 
previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking 
and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, 
still breathing heavily.

Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.

McDERMOTT 
Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough 
day at the office?

They all laugh.

McDERMOTT 
Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking 
Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't 
get a reservation to save his life.

Bateman sits down silently.

McDERMOTT 
Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.

BATEMAN 
(On automatic) 
I'm not going anywhere unless we 
have a reservation.

VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, 
faggots-just get a res.

PRICE 
Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.

Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses. 

BATEMAN 
(He downs his drink) 
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.
He approaches Carnes cautiously. 

CARNES 
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the 
end of the '90s.

Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.

BATEMAN 
Shut up, Carnes, they will not.

Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.

BATEMAN 
So, Harold, did you get my message?

Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.

CARNES 
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, 
wasn't it?

BATEMAN 
(Waving smoke out of his face) 
Yes, naturally.

CARNES 
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s 
fabulous. That's rich...

Pause

CARNES 
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?

BATEMAN 
What exactly do you mean?

CARNES 
The message you left.

Carnes is distracted, waving at people.

CARNES 
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still 
seeing her, right?

BATEMAN 
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?

Carnes isn't really listening.

CARNES 
Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?

He turns to go.

BATEMAN 
Carnes? Wait.

CARNES 
(Sighing) 
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. 
But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, 
such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully 
appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said 
Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's 
have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

BATEMAN 
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?

CARNES 
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let 
alone...what was it you said he did to her?

Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing 
couple. He laughs politely.

CARNES 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

BATEMAN 
(Desperate, shouting) 
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really 
comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. 
I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. 
I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your 
machine was true.

CARNES 
Excuse me. I really must he going.

BATEMAN 
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm 
Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! 
Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.

Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.

BATEMAN 
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed 
Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer

CARNES 
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find 
this funny anymore.

BATEMAN 
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

CARNES 
(Eyeing Bateman worriedly)
It's just not.

BATEMAN 
Why not, you stupid bastard?

Carnes stares at him.

CARNES 
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in 
London...just ten days ago.

BATEMAN 
No, you...didn't?

CARNES 
Now, if you'll excuse me.

Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.
They are all looking at the television, where Ronald 
Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are 
halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's 
lying.

PRICE 
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?

VAN PATTEN 
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? 
I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have 
reservations somewhere.

PRICE 
(To Bateman) 
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...
out of it. So...undangerous.

McDERMOTT 
He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.
Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that 
shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know, 
what can I say?

PRICE 
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that 
way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so 
fucking, I don't know, cool about it?

VAN PATTEN 
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.

PRICE 
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?

BATEMAN 
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.
VAN PATTEN 
(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. 
Working for UNICEF now?

McDERMOTT 
Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?

PRICE 
Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless 
Old codger. But inside...

Pause.

PRICE 
But inside...

The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
But inside doesn't matter...

THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.

McDERMOTT 
(Bored)
Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually 
listening to you.

PRICE 
Bateman? Come on, what do you think? 

Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.

BATEMAN 
Whatever.

The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone. 

VAN PATTEN 
Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.

The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs 
over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of 
other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing,

BATEMAN (V.O.)
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with 
the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, 
all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward 
it, I have now surpassed...

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary. 
We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with 
doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost 
and frightened, and begins to cry.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better 
world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on 
others. I want no escape.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING 
As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is 
leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch, 
his eyes blank.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no 
deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted 
from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any 
of this. This confession has meant nothing...

The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him: 
"THIS IS NOT AN EXIT."

                                  BASIC INSTINCT
           

          INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we don't see clearly.  a man and woman make love 
          on a brass bed.  There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling.  
          On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A 
          tape deck PLAYS the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.  
          He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him...

          JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't 
          see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA 
          STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.

          She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she 
          kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms 
          above his head.

          She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the 
          bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his 
          face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains 
          towards her.

          The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...  
          gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... 
          lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his 
          navel.  The SONG plays.

          He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.

          She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...

          Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she 
          extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the 
          steel flashes... his throat is white...

          He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...

          It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and 
          up... and...

          EXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING

          Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy.  Cop cars everywhere.  
          The lights play through the thick fog.  Two Homicide detectives 
          get out of the car, walk into the house.

          NICK CURRAN is 42.  Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face 
          urban, edged, shadowed.  GUS MORAN is 64.  Crew-cut, silver 
          beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face 
          worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher.

          INT. THE BROWNSTONE

          There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a 
          Picasso on the wall.  They check it out.

                                    GUS
                        Who was this fuckin' guy?

                        Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.

                                    GUS
                        I never heard of him.

                        Not now he don't.

          Past the uniformed guys... nods... waves... past the forensic 
          men... past the coroner's investigators... they get to the 
          bedroom.

          INT. THE BEDROOM

          They walk in, stare -- it's messy.

          It's like a convention in here.  LT. PHIL WALKER, in his 50's, 
          silver-haired, the Homicide guys; JIM HARRIGAN, late 40's, 
          puffy, affable;  SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black.  A CORONER'S MAN is 
          working the bed.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick and Gus)
                        You guys know Captain Talcott?

          They nod.

                                    GUS
                        What's the Chief's office doin' 
                        here.

                        The skin blanches when I press it --
                        this kind of color is about right 
                        for six or eight hours.

                        Nobody say anything.  The maid 
                        came in an hour ago and found him.
                        She's not a live-in.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe the maid did it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He left the club with his girlfriend 
                        about midnight.  That's the last 
                        time anybody saw him.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        There's come all over the sheets --
                        he got off before he got offed.

                               (deadpan)

                        This is sensitive.  Mr. Boz was a 
                        major contributor to the mayor's 
                        campaign.  He was Chairman of the

                        What's that over there?

          We see the white powder laid out in lines on the small mirror 
          on the side table.

                                    NICK
                               (deadpan)
                        It looks like some civic-minded, 
                        very respectable cocaine to me, 
                        Gus.

                        Listen to me, Curran.  I'm going 
                        to get a lot of heat on this.  I 
                        don't want any... mistakes.

          Nick and Talcott look at each other a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Who's the girlfriend?

          Lt. Walker looks at the notepad in his hand.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.

          Nick writes it down.  He and Gus turn, leave.  Captain Talcott 
          watches them.  He looks disturbed.

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM

                        Talcott doesn't usually show up at 
                        the office 'till after his 18 holes.  
                        What are they nervous about?

                                    GUS
                        They're executives.  They're nervous 
                        about everything.

                        Nick!

          He stops, turns, sees Walker behind them.  Walker comes up to 
          them.

                                    LT. WALKER

          EXT. A VICTORIAN ON DIVISADERO - DAY

          It is more a mansion than a house.  They ring the bell.  An 
          Hispanic MAID answers.  They flash their badges.

                        Just moment.  Come in.

          She leads them into a lavish, beautifully done living room 
          that offers a sweeping view of the Bay.

                        Sit, please.  Just moment.

          They look around, impressed.  There is a Picasso on the wall 
          here, too.

                                    GUS

                        hide it.

          Nick smiles -- and at that moment a beautiful BLONDE walks 
          into the room.  She looks like she has been asleep.  She is in 
          her early 20's.  She wears a very sheer robe.

          EXT. SEADRIFT - STINSON BEACH - DAY

          Foggy.  Cold.  It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean.  
          Multi-million dollar "beach houses" with gardens and swimming 
          pools.  There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black, 
          one white.

          They get out of the car in front of the house.  They see a 
          woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring 
          at the sea, a blanket around her.  As they get to her --

          She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away.

          CATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.  She has long blonde hair 
          and a refined, classically beautiful face.  She is not knockout 
          gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about 
          her.

          She doesn't look at them.  She looks at the water.

                        With an ice pick.

          She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see 
          a thin smile.  They see it, too, and glance at each other.

                        him.

          They glance at each other again.

                                    GUS
                        What are you -- a pro?

          Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I'm an amateur.

                        No.  We had a drink at the club.
                        We left together.  I came here.  
                        He went home.

                        No.  I wasn't in the mood to have 
                        sex with anyone last night.

          They look at her a beat.

                        Let me ask you something, Ms.
                        Tramell?  Are you sorry he's dead?

          Catherine looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  I liked fucking him.

          They stare at her.  She looks out at the water.

                        I don't really feel like talking

                        and I'll go downtown.

          She doesn't even look at them.

                        My sex life is pretty shitty 
                        actually since I stopped seeing

          That embarrassed her; she looks away from him.

                        pathology of psychopathic behavior 
                        at Stanford and is also a member 
                        of the Justice Department's 
                        Psychological Profile team.  Dr.  
                        Lamott?

                        There are two possibilities.  One.  
                        The person who wrote this book is 
                        your murderer and acted out the 
                        killing described in ritualistic, 
                        literal detail.  Two.  Someone who 
                        wants to do the person who wrote 
                        this book harm read the book and 
                        enacted the killing described to 
                        incriminate the writer.

                               (after a long beat)
                        What if the writer did it?  What 
                        are we dealing with?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing with a devious, 
                        diabolical mind.  This book must 
                        have been written at least six 
                        months, maybe years before it was 
                        published.  That means the writer 
                        planned the crime, at least in the 
                        subconscious, back then.  The fact 
                        that the writer carried it out 
                        indicates psychopathic obsessive 
                        behavior in terms not only of the 
                        killing itself but in terms of 
                        applied advance defense mechanism.

                        best alibi.

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        Correct.

                        I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone 
                        in the exact way I've described in 
                        my book?  I wouldn't do that because 
                        I'd know I'd be a suspect.

          A long beat -- as they think about it.

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing then with someone 
                        so obsessed that he or she is 
                        willing to kill an irrelevant and 
                        innocent victim to place the blame 
                        on the person who wrote this book.  
                        We are talking about deep-seated, 
                        obsessional hatred; an utter lack 
                        of sense of proportion or 
                        perspective.

                        dangerous and very ill.

          INT. THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

          PROSECUTOR JOHN CORRIGAN, a big man in his 50's, with Captain 
          Talcott, Lt. Walker, Nick, and Gus.

          Corrigan is reading a file.  He gets up, yawns, goes to his 
          window, looks out.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Come on, you know there's no case 
                        here.  There's no physical evidence -- 
                        okay, she doesn't have an alibi 
                        but there's no motive.  Her defense 
                        would just beat us to death with 
                        the copycat thing.  Anybody who 
                        read the book could have done it.

          A long beat; no one says anything.

                                    NICK
                        So what do we do -- nothing?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        We bring her in for questioning.

                                    TALCOTT
                        She's got enough money to burn 
                        this whole department down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She was the last person seen with 
                        the guy -- I'll take the 
                        responsibility.

                                    TALCOTT
                        It's yours.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        It won't do any good.  She'll come 
                        in with Lee Bailey and Mel Belli 
                        trailing behind her on a solid 
                        gold chain from Tiffanys.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Yes she will.

          They look at him.

                               (smiles)
                        I don't think she's going to hide 
                        behind anybody.  I don't think 
                        she's going to hide at all.

                                    TALCOTT
                               (after a beat)
                        I think you're as crazy as she 
                        probably is, Curran.

          Nicks says nothing.

                        You know what they say: It takes

          Nick looks a Gus, grins.

          EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - DAY

          They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house.

          They ring the bell.  They hear typing inside.  The typing stops.  
          She comes to the door in jeans and a tight-fitting sweatshirt.

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come 
                        downtown and answer some questions 
                        for us.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Are you arresting me?

                                    NICK
                        If that's the way you want to play 
                        it.

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Can I change into something more 
                        appropriate?  It'll just take a 
                        minute.

          He nods.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Come in.

          INT. THE HOUSE

          It is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif.  She goes to a 
          bedroom of the living room.

          Nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into.  
          Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom.

          There is a coffee table between them.  She leaves the bedroom 
          door halfway open.

          An old newspaper is on the coffee table.  Nick reaches for it.  
          The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS.  A 
          headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL.  
          There is a photograph of Nick.

          He stares at the paper.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How long will this take?

          Nick puts the paper down on the coffee table.  He is lost in 
          his thoughts.  Gus picks the paper up.

                                    NICK
                               (looks up)
                        I don't know.

          Nick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near 
          the wall of the bedroom.  The mirror reflects her in the other 
          corner of the bedroom.  She is taking her clothes off.  He 
          stares.  She strips down.  He sees her back. She has a beautiful 
          body.  Naked, she puts a dress on.  She doesn't put any 
          underwear on.

                                    NICK
                        Do you always keep old newspapers 
                        around?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Only when they make interesting 
                        reading.

          And she is suddenly out of the bedroom.  She stands there, 
          smiles.  They look at each other a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (finally)
                        I'm ready.

          They get up, head out.

                                    GUS
                        You have the right to an attorney.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Why would I need an attorney?

          INT. THE CAR - DAY

          They sit in the front; she is in the back.  The car goes over 
          the winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road.

          The fog is heavy.  It's starting to rain.  We see the beach 
          far below.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Do you have a cigarette?

                                    NICK
                        I don't smoke.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you do.

                                    NICK
                        I quit.

          She smiles, looks at him.  A beat, and he turns away.  Another 
          beat, and she lights a cigarette up.

                                    NICK
                        I thought you were out of 
                        cigarettes.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I found some in my purse; would 
                        you like one?

          He turns back to her.

                                    NICK
                        I told you -- I quit.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It won't last.

          A beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away.

          He watches her in the rearview mirror.

                        It teaches you to lie.

                        You make it up, but it has to be 
                        believable.  They call it suspension 
                        of disbelief.

                                    GUS
                        I like that.  "Suspension of

          He smiles at her in the mirror.

                        What happens to him?

          She looks right into his eye.

                                    CATHERINE
                        She kills him.

          A beat, as they look at each other, and then he turns away 
          from her.  Gus watcher her in the rearview mirror.

          She walks in with Nick and Gus.  In the room are prosecutor 
          John Corrigan, Lt. Walker, Captain Talcott, Harrigan, and 
          Andrews.  There is a police stenographer a plain young woman 
          in her 20's.

          As soon as she comes in --

                                    CORRIGAN
                        I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant 
                        district attorney, Ms.  Tramell.  
                        Can we get you anything?  Would 
                        you like some coffee?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No thank you.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Are your attorneys --

                                    NICK
                               (hiding a smile)
                        Ms. Tramell waived her right to an 
                        attorney.

          Corrigan and Talcott glance at Nick.  She sees the look.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Did I miss something?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want an 
                        attorney present.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Why have you waived your right to 
                        an attorney, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Nick)
                        Why did you think I wouldn't want 
                        one?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want to 
                        hide.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I have nothing to hide.

          The two of them keep their eyes on each other.

          She sits down.  They sit around her.  Nick sits directly across 
          from her.  She lights up a cigarette.  They watch her.  

          She is poised, cool, in complete command of herself.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        There is no smoking in this 
                        building, Ms. Tramell.

                                    CATHERINE
                        What are you going to do?  Charge 
                        me with smoking?

          Ever so casually, she blows her smoke across at Nick.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Would you tell us the nature of 
                        your relationship with Mr. Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I had sex with him for about a 
                        year and a half.  I liked having 
                        sex with him.

          She has control of the room; she looks from one man to the 
          other as she speaks.

                                    CATHERINE
                        He wasn't afraid of experimenting.  
                        I like men like that.  I like men 
                        who give me pleasure.  He gave me 
                        a lot of pleasure.

          A beat, as they watch her.  She is so matter-of-fact.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Did you ever engage in sado-
                        masochistic activity with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Exactly what do you have in mind, 
                        Mr. Corrigan.

                                    CORRIGAN
                               (after a beat, little 
                               flustered)
                        Did you ever tie him up?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

                                    ANDREWS
                        You never tied him up.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No. Johnny liked to use his hands 
                        too much.  I like hands and fingers.

          They stare at her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You describe a white silk scarf in 
                        your book.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I've always had a fondness for 
                        white silk scarves.
                               (she smiles)
                        I have a very vivid imagination.

                                    NICK
                        But you said you liked men to use 
                        their hands.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I said I liked Johnny to use 
                        his hands.
                               (she smiles)
                        I don't give any rules, Nick.  I 
                        go with the flow.

          They have their eyes on each other.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd have to be pretty stupid to 
                        write a book about a killing and 
                        then kill him the way I described 
                        in my book. I'd be announcing myself 
                        as the killer.  I'm not stupid.

          She smiles.

                                    TALCOTT
                        We know you're not stupid, Ms.
                        Tramell.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Maybe that's what you're counting 
                        on to get you off the hook.

                                    NICK
                        Writing a book about it gives you 
                        an alibi for not killing him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes it does, doesn't it?

          She holds his eyes a second, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        The answer is no.  I didn't kill 
                        him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

                                    GUS
                        Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Sometimes.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        Did you ever do drugs with Mr. 
                        Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Sure.

                                    GUS
                        What kind of drugs?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Cocaine.

          She looks directly at Nick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Have you ever fucked on cocaine?
                               (she smiles)
                        It's nice.

          He watches her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

                                    NICK
                        You like playing games, don't you?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I've got a degree in psych.  It 
                        goes with the turf.  Games are 
                        fun.

          They are holding each other's eyes.

                                    NICK
                        How about boxing?  That's a game.
                        Was that fun for you?

          They don't take their eyes off each other for a second.

                                    TALCOTT
                        I think that's irrelevant to this 
                        inquiry.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Nick)
                        Yes it was.  Bobby died.

                                    NICK
                        How did you feel when he died?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I loved him.  I hurt.

          Their eyes are still on each other.

                                    NICK
                        How did you feel when I told you 
                        Johnny Boz had died -- that day at 
                        the beach.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I felt somebody had read my book 
                        and was playing a game.

                                    NICK
                        But you didn't hurt --

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

                                    NICK
                        Because you didn't love him --

                                    CATHERINE
                        That's right.

          Their eyes are digging into each other.

                                    NICK
                        Even though you were fucking him.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        You still get the pleasure.  Didn't 
                        you ever fuck anybody else while 
                        you were married, Nick?

          A beat; he stares at her, expressionless.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How did you know he was married?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (watching Nick)
                        Maybe I was guessing.  What 
                        difference does it make?

          She lights a cigarette.  He stares at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Would you like a cigarette, Nick?

          He just stares at her, expressionless.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Do you two know each other?

                                    NICK
                        No.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

          INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

                                    ANDREWS
                        How did you meet Mr. Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I wanted to write a book about the 
                        murder of a retired rock star.  I 
                        went down to his club and picked 
                        him up.  Then I had sex with him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You didn't feel anything for him.
                        You just had sex with him for your 
                        book.

          She looks at Nick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        In the beginning.  Then I got to 
                        like what he did for me.

                                    GUS
                        That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm a writer,  I use people for 
                        what I write.  You write what you 
                        know.  Let the world beware.

          She and Nick have their eyes on each other, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Corrigan, smiles)
                        Would you like me to take a lie 
                        detector test?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. THE POLICE BUILDING - NIGHT

          We see her in a glass-enclosed cubicle with a polygraph 
          EXAMINER.  Nick stands outside watching her with Gus and Lt. 
          Walker.  Her back is to them.  The Examiner shuts the machine 
          down, gathers rolls of papers, and comes out of the cubicle.

                                    THE EXAMINER
                        No blips, no blood pressure 
                        variations, no pulse variance.  
                        Either she's telling the truth or 
                        I've never met anyone like her.

          A long beat, then --

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Well, I guess that's it.

          A long beat, Nick watches her as she sits inside.

                                    NICK
                        How does somebody beat this machine?

                                    THE EXAMINER
                        Ninety-nine point nine percent of 
                        the cases, they don't.  You'd have 
                        to be able to mask the truth from 
                        your own central nervous system, 
                        your circulatory system, your 
                        adrenal glands.  In my opinion, 
                        this woman is telling the truth.

          The Examiner walks away.  They stand there. Catherine stands 
          at the door of the cubicle behind them --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I go now?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        Yes.  Thanks for coming in, Ms.
                        Tramell.  I'm sorry to inconvenience 
                        you.

          She says nothing, has a thin smile.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I ask one of you for a ride?

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Sure.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Thanks.

          And he and Catherine walk away.  Gus and Walker watch them.

          INT. HIS CAR - NIGHT

          It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche.  It is pouring 
          rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm.  Nothing 
          is said a long beat as he drives.  She yawns.  Stretches.  He 
          looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I'm tired.

                                    NICK
                        It's got to be tiring to beat that 
                        machine.

          She looks at him and looks away.  A beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        If I were guilty, and if I wanted 
                        to beat that machine, it wouldn't 
                        be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring 
                        at all.

                                    NICK
                        Why not?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Because I'm a professional liar.  
                        I spend most of my waking hours 
                        dwelling on my lies.
                               (a beat)
                        For my writing.

          He looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I love the rain, don't you?

          He says nothing, doesn't look at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You took a polygraph after you 
                        shot those two people, didn't you?

          He looks at her now.

                                    NICK
                        I passed.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You see?  We're both innocent, 
                        Nick.

          He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops.  He 
          sees the white Ferrari in the driveway.

                                    NICK
                        How do you know all this stuff 
                        about me?

                                    CATHERINE
                        You know all about me.

                                    NICK
                        I don't know anything that isn't 
                        police business.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        You know I don't like to wear any 
                        underwear, don't you, Nick?

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Thanks for the ride.

          And she's out of the car.  He watches her as she hurries in 
          the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the 
          door and is inside.

          INT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT

          It is a police bar, San Francisco style.  Ferns  Joe Montana 
          and Will Clark posters.  The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett.

          He walks in.  He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus, 
          goes to them, sits down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What is all this "Nick" stuff --
                        Nick would you like a cigarette.
                        Nick can you give me a ride.

                                    NICK
                        She didn't ask me for the ride.
                        She asked anybody.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        And you volunteered.

          A BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Perrier, Nick?

                                    NICK
                        Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.

                                    GUS
                               (with concern)
                        What you doin', son?

                                    NICK
                        It's my first drink in three months.  
                        That okay with you, pop?
                               (to Lt. Walker)
                        She doesn't know me.  I never saw 
                        her before Gus and I talked to 
                        her.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          He gets up, gets his drink --

                                    NICK
                        Thanks, Harry.

          He sits back down.  He takes a big slug.  They watch him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You sure?

                                    NICK
                        I'm sure.

          He takes another big slug.

                                    NICK
                        Now what?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What now what? Now nothing.  She 
                        passed the polygraph.  That's it.

                                    NICK
                        She knew she could beat it.  That's 
                        why she asked to take it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How the fuck do you know?  What is 
                        it with you and this broad anyway?

                                    NICK
                        Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna 
                        let this slide.  What about her 
                        parents?  What about what else 
                        she's published?  At least we should 
                        get the stuff to see if we find 
                        anything else that's an amazing 
                        real-life coincidence.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Her parents died in an accident.  
                        I don't care what else she's 
                        written.  What are you -- a book 
                        critic?

                                    NICK
                        How did they die?  Was there an 
                        investigation?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How you're saying she killed her 
                        parents?  Did she kill Bobby 
                        Vasquez, too?

                                    GUS
                        Not unless she got up in the ring 
                        and turned into one mean 
                        sonofabitch.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she 
                        grew herself an Afro and learned a 
                        left hook and put shoe polish on 
                        her face.  Let's polygraph her 
                        again and ask her about it.

                                    NICK
                               (casually)
                        Fuck you, Phil.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Fuck you, too Nick.

          A beat, then --

                                    NICK
                               (calls to the 
                               Bartender)
                        Can you get me another double Black 
                        Jack, Harry.

          Gus looks at him with concern.  A man in his 50's -- LT. MARTIN 
          NILSEN  is suddenly there.  He is overweight, florid.

                                    NILSEN
                               (to Nick)
                        Hey, shooter -- You back on the 
                        Black Jack, Shooter?

          He grins.  Nick doesn't look at him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        We're discussing a case, Marty.

                                    NILSEN
                        I know that.  I had no doubt of 
                        that.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          Nilsen takes the drink, hands it to Nick.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        Double, huh, Shooter?

          Nick turns to him.  He's sitting in the booth; Nilsen is 
          standing there.  Nick looks like he's barely restraining 
          himself.

                                    NICK
                        I'm off-duty, Nilsen.  You hear 
                        me?  I'm off-duty discussing a 
                        case.  Internal Affairs shouldn't 
                        have any trouble with that.  Maybe 
                        I should put in for overtime.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        You do that, Shooter.  Why don't 
                        you send it to me?  I'll give it 
                        special attention.

          A beat, and then Nick gets up, faces him.

                                    NICK
                        I'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen --

          Lt. Walker and Gus get up and hold Nick back.

          Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.

                                    BETH
                        What's the problem?

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        No problem, Doctor.  Here comes 
                        the Doctor just in time to save 
                        her patient.  Take care, Shooter.

          And he walks away.  Nick still looks like he wants to go after 
          him.  Beth pulls him away from the booth.

                                    BETH
                        You okay?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Yeah.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        You don't look so okay.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What are you doing here?

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Baby-sitting.
                               (she shrugs)
                        Rookie cop.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What else is new?

          A beat.  He looks at her again.

                                    NICK
                        You want to get out of here?

          She looks at him a beat.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Yes.

          At the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it's for old-time's sake.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (watches them go 
                               out)
                        Sometimes I think he started banging 
                        her just to get himself off the 
                        hook with Internal Affairs.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat, smiles)
                        He ain't that way.  He's got heart.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah.  I know.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          He is kissing her -- hard, rough.  He forces her against the 
          wall.

                                    BETH
                        Don't -- please, Nick --

          We hear her dress RIP.  He kisses her harder -- we hear her 
          panties RIP.  He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under 
          her bra --

                                    BETH
                        Please don't -- don't --

          He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move 
          down to the floor.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

          It is dark.  The are still partially dressed.  They are on the 
          floor.  He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling.

          She lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her.

          There is a bite mark on her shoulder.  A long beat, silence -- 
          then --

                                    BETH
                        What was she like?

                                    NICK
                        Who?

                                    BETH
                        Catherine Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        She said what you said she'd say.

          She sits up, looks away.  He looks at her, puts his finger on 
          the bite mark idly, gently.  A beat, and he kisses her shoulder 
          gently, then lies back down.

                                    BETH
                        I met her at Berkeley.

          He looks at her.

                                    BETH
                        We were in some of the same classes.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Why didn't you tell me?

          She looks at him.

                                    BETH
                        I'm telling you.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (with difficulty)
                        You've never been... like that...  
                        before.

          He says nothing, looks away from her.

                                    BETH
                        Why?

          He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing.

                                    NICK
                        You're the shrink.

          She keeps looking at him.  He won't look at her.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love to me.

          A beat; he looks at her.

                                    NICK
                        Who was I making love to?

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love.

          They look at each other, a long beat, then away.  He lies back 
          down.  Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        I need a cigarette.

                                    BETH
                               (after a beat)
                        I thought you quit.

          He says nothing.

                                    BETH
                        Top drawer in the foyer.
                               (a beat)
                        Get it on your way out.

          He looks at her; she won't look at him.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - MORNING

          He walks in.  He looks hung-over.  He sees Gus with Harrigan 
          and Andrews and Lt. Walker in Lt. Walker's glass-enclosed office 
          at the end of this big room.

          They look at him when they see him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You look like dogshit.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        He looks a little shrunk, that's 
                        all.

                                    ANDREWS
                               (after a beat)
                        We got a call from Berkeley P.D.
                        There was a killing.  A professor.
                        Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple 
                        stab wounds.  1977.

                                    NICK
                               (a thin smile)
                        She was there, wasn't she?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        University records say she was 
                        there.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat, then --

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (suddenly)
                        Gus -- go over to Berkeley.
                        Harrigan -- find out what else 
                        she's published.  Andrews -- get 
                        the files on her parents' accident.
                        Carbon Beth on everything.  I want 
                        some psychological input on this 
                        Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is 
                        left there with Gus.

                                    NICK
                        What about me?

                                    GUS
                        You're already gettin' psychological 
                        input, son.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Go stick your head in a tub of ice 
                        water.
                               (a beat; then 
                               seriously)
                        See where she leads.

          EXT. THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY

          The black Ferrari is in the driveway.  He sits in an unmarked 
          police car on a hillside above the house, watching.  It is a 
          bleak, leaden gray day.

          Catherine comes out of the house.  She is dressed casually.

          She gets into the Ferrari.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic 
          highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson 
          Beach into Marin County.

          She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting 
          in and out, passing cars very fast.

          He has to start cutting around cars to keep up.  This woman 
          really drives.

          He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey 
          Lines Tour Bus head-on.  Close call: sheer drops on either 
          side.

          He looks frazzled.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- 
          little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.

          He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her.  And then 
          he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured 
          by hedges.

          He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a 
          long beat.  He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks.  
          A small, nondescript house.  He watches.  He can't see anything 
          inside the house.

          A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it.  He takes 
          an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He watches as she comes out of the house.  A frail old woman 
          in her 70's is with her.  She hugs the old woman, gets into 
          the Ferrari, STARTS it up.

          He waits a beat and then STARTS after her.  He stays behind 
          her at a distance -- she is going slowly.  And then she suddenly 
          GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.

          He GUNS his car after her.  He makes a turn.  She is gone.

          There is a fork in the road.  He turns one way, goes a few 
          hundred feet.

          Nothing.  Blackness.  He stops.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)
                        Shit.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach.  The black 
          Ferrari is in the driveway.

          A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn.  
          He sees the outline of her body now.

          She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, 
          behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost 
          languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          He is alone, nobody else in the big room.

          He sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has 
          punched in

          HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.

          He is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen

          NOTHING CURRENT.

          A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these 
          words

          RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965.

          We see him type in the words

          PRIOR ARREST RECORD.

          A long beat, and then it comes up

          HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO

          He stares at the screen a long beat.

                        statement from her.

          Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere.

                                    NICK
                               (slowly)
                        Do you remember a case -- 1956 --
                        Hazel Dobkins?

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta 
                        my head for years.  Still can't.  
                        Nice little kids -- nice husband, 
                        wasn't porkin' around -- no 
                        financial problems.  One day -- 
                        outta the clear blue sky -- she 
                        does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a 
                        knife. He got for a wedding present.  
                        Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as 
                        honey.  Said she didn't know why 
                        she done it.

          Nick just stares at him.

          EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY

          He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.  
          He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach 
          entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing 
          inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine 
          stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex 
          leotards.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Hi.

          He looks at her a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Am I... disturbing you?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  Come in.

          They have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to 
          go in.

          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE

          She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches 
          her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns 
          the Stones DOWN.

          On a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread 
          around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him.

          We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW.  
          She sees him glancing at the clips.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm using you for my detective.  
                        In my book.  You don't mind, do 
                        you?

          She smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Would you like a drink?  I was 
                        just going to have one.

                                    NICK
                        No, thanks.

          She goes to the bar.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        That's right.  You're off the Jack 
                        Daniels too, aren't you?

          She is making herself a drink.  She takes the ice out and then 
          opens a drawer and gets an icepick.  It has a fat wooden end.  
          She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'd like to ask you a few more 
                        questions.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd like to ask you some, too.

          She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.

                                    CATHERINE
                        For my book.

          She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick.  She 
          raises her arm, plunges it.  Raises it, plunges it.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK
                               (wary)
                        What kind of questions?

          She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to 
          him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How does it feel to kill someone?

          He looks at her a long beat.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        You tell me.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I don't know.  But you do.

          Their eyes are on each other.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        It was an accident.  They got in 
                        the line of fire.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Four shootings in five years.  All 
                        accidents.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        They were drug buys.  I was a vice 
                        cop.

          A long beat, as they look at each other.

                                    NICK
                        Tell me about Professor Goldstein.

          BEAT.

                                    CATHERINE
                        There's a name from the past.

                                    NICK
                        You want a name from the present?
                        How about Hazel Dobkins?

          She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her 
          eyes off him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Noah was my counselor in my freshman 
                        year.
                               (she smiles)
                        That's probably where I got the 
                        idea for the icepick.  For my book.
                        Funny how the subconscious works.
                               (a beat)
                        Hazel is my friend.

                                    NICK
                        She wiped out her whole family.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  She's helped me understand 
                        homicidal impulse.

                                    NICK
                        Didn't you study it in school?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Only in theory.
                               (she smiles)
                        You know all about homicidal 
                        impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not 
                        in theory -- in practice.

          He stares at her a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        What happened, Nick?  Did you get 
                        sucked into it? Did you like it 
                        too much?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          He stares at her, almost horrified.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Tell me about the coke, Nick.  The 
                        day you shot those two tourists --
                        how much coke did you do?

          She steps closer to him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Tell me, Nick.

          She puts her hand softly on his cheek,  He grabs her hand 
          roughly, holds it.

                                    NICK
                        I didn't.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you did.  They never tested 
                        you, did they?  But Internal Affairs 
                        knew.

          They are face to face.  He is still holding her roughly by the 
          hand.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Your wife knew, didn't she?  She 
                        knew what was going on.  Nicky got 
                        too close to the flame.  Nicky 
                        liked it.

          He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed 
          against each other -- their eyes digging into each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        That's why she killed herself?

          He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against 
          him.  We hear the DOOR behind them.  A beat, and he lets her 
          go, turns away from her.

          Roxy stands there, staring at them.  Her hair is up.  She wears 
          a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans 
          and cowboy boots.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (brightly)
                        Hiya, hon.  You two have met, 
                        haven't you?

          Roxy looks at Nick.  Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly 
          on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of 
          them looking at Nick.

          He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You're going to make a terrific 
                        character, Nick.

          He doesn't look at her; he's gone.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY

          He comes in.  He looks like he's going to kill someone.  A 
          RECEPTIONIST sits there.

                                    RECEPTIONIST
                        She's on the phone -- she'll be 
                        right with you, detective --He 
                        sweeps by her into Beth's inner 
                        office.  She hangs up when she 
                        sees the look on his face.

                                    NICK
                        Who's got access to my goddamn 
                        file?

          She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him.

                        Nobody.

                        record, it'd be illegal --She backs 
                        into a wall.  She looks very scared.  
                        He comes very close to her -- puts 
                        an arm behind her to the wall.

          INT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY

          He storms into the big room.  He sees MARTY NILSEN.  He is 
          sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside 
          this big room.  About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in 
          the big room.  He goes by them into Nilsen's office.

          INT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE

          He closes the door.  Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs 
          his chair away towards the wall.

                                    NILSEN
                        What do you want, Curran?                                                                     

          He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against 
          the wall.

          He slams him against the wall again.  The glass EXPLODES behind 
          them -- a chair comes into the room.  Nick is frozen, holding 
          Nilsen by the throat against the wall.

                                    ONE OF THE I.A. GUYS
                        Let him go, Curran.  Nice and easy.

          He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns 
          drawn, pointed at him.  A beat, and he lets Nilsen go.  He 
          turns calmly and starts to walk out.

                                    NILSEN
                        You're on sick leave, Shooter.  As 
                        of right now.  Pending the outcome 
                        of a psychiatric evaluation.

          EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK

          He gets into his old Porsche.  He STARTS the car up.  Gus Moran 
          comes up to the window.  They look at each other a

                                    GUS
                        What's goin' down, son?

                                    NICK
                        Nothin'
                               (a beat)
                        I'll be okay, pop.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    GUS
                        No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke 
                        off yonder on the horizon.  They're 
                        gonna want your badge.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        I got tired of being played with.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat)
                        You sure got real conclusive ways 
                        of demonstrating that.

          They almost smile at each other, then --

                                    NICK
                               (almost to himself)
                        She knows where I live and breathe.  
                        She's coming after me.

                                    GUS
                               (after a long beat)
                        What is it you got between you?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; to 
                               himself)
                        I don't know.

                                    GUS
                        Somethin', though.

          A beat, and then Nick looks at him.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Somethin'.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He sits in front of the TV, watching a lame sitcom.  A bottle 
          of Jack Daniels is half-empty in front of him.  He is smoking 
          a cigarette.

                                    BETH
                               (behind him)
                        I still have my key.

          He looks at her, looks away at the sitcom.

                                    NICK
                        I don't want to see you, Beth.

          He keeps watching the sitcom.  A long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (suddenly angry)
                        Damnit!  Don't shut me out!  You 
                        owe me more than that?

          He goes to the TV, shuts it off.

                                    NICK
                        I don't owe you anything; you don't 
                        owe me anything.
                               (he looks at her)
                        We went to bed -- what was it? --
                        ten or fifteen times?
                               (he smiles)
                        It wasn't memorable enough to carry 
                        any obligations.

                                    BETH
                               (after a long beat)
                        Sometimes I really hate you.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah?  Well why don't you find 
                        some friendly therapist and work 
                        some of that hostility out.
                               (a beat)
                        But take my advice.  Put a little 
                        more life into it than you usually 
                        do.

          A beat, and she suddenly hurls herself at him in absolute fury, 
          trying to claw at his face.  He grabs her, blocks her.  They 
          look at each other a long beat and then he lets her go.

          The emotion of the moment is gone now -- they turn away from 
          each other.

                                    BETH
                               (finally)
                        I'm sorry... I don't usually... 
                        act like that.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        How could you let him have my file, 
                        Beth?

          A long beat, then --

                                    BETH
                               (not looking at him)
                        He was going to recommend your 
                        discharge a behavioral disability.  
                        I made a deal with him.  He could 
                        review the session notes himself.  
                        It was the only way I could keep 
                        you on the force.

          She looks at him.  He looks away from her.

                                    NICK
                        You did it for me.

                                    BETH
                        Yes.  I care about you.  I did it 
                        for you.

          He turns away from her.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)
                        Get out of here, Beth.
                               (a beat)
                        Please?

          He goes to the Jack Daniel's, pours some more.  She looks at 
          him pour it and turns to go.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He is asleep on the couch -- the TV is on to a blank screen.  
          The Jack Daniel's is mostly gone.  The phone on the coffee 
          table RINGS.  It RINGS again.  He wakes, picks it up, listens.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Okay.

          He hangs it up.  He sits there a long beat, staring.  He looks 
          disturbed.

          EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE TEN-FOUR BAR - NIGHT

          He walks down the alley.  There are lots of police cars, 
          flashing lights, uniformed men, coroner's men.

          As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt. Walker, Gus, and several 
          of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier in Nilsen's office.  
          They are standing around a Lincoln Town Car.

          They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then move aside.

          He can see into the car now.  Martin Nilsen lies against the 
          front seat.  He has been shot in the head.  Nick stares.

                                    GUS
                        One shot.  Close range.  Probably 
                        a .38 caliber revolver.

          Nick stares at Nilsen's body.  They watch him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Give me your gun, Nick.

          A beat, and then Nick gives him his gun.  Walker smells it, 
          shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men.

                                    NICK
                               (to Walker)
                        You think I --

                                    GUS
                        I don't son, but I got the minority 
                        opinion.

          INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by 
          four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt.

          Walker, Gus, and Captain Talcott.  Lt. Walker and Gus sort of 
          sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation.  The same police 
          stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in 
          the room who was there with Catherine.

                                    NICK
                        Okay.  I went after him.  I lost 
                        my temper.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Do you have any evidence that he 
                        showed your psychiatric file to 
                        anyone?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          Beth Gardner comes into the room.  They look at her.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr.
                        Gardner.

          Nick gives her a look.

                                    BETH
                        I'd like to sit-in if you don't 
                        mind.

                                    THE I.A. MAN
                        I'd really rather --

                                    TALCOTT
                        I don't see anything wrong with 
                        Dr. Gardner sitting-in if Detective 
                        Curran doesn't object.

          Nick looks at her, shrugs.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Where were you tonight?

                                    NICK
                        Home. Watching TV.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        All night?

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Were you drinking?

          He looks at Beth.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah, I was drinking.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        When did you start drinking again?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        A couple days ago.

                                    BETH
                        I saw Detective Curran at his 
                        apartment around ten o'clock.  He 
                        was sober and lucid.  I asked him 
                        in my capacity as his departmental 
                        therapist about his altercation 
                        with Lt. Nilsen.  He expressed 
                        regret and displayed no hostility.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                               (to Beth)
                        How long were you at his apartment?

                                    BETH
                        About fifteen minutes.  I saw there 
                        was no reason for my concern and 
                        left.

          She and Nick look at each other.  He looks away and lights a 
          cigarette.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        There's no smoking in this building.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        What are you gonna do -- charge me 
                        with smoking?

          It is the exact line that Catherine used.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the 
                        record did you kill him?

                                    NICK
                        No.

          They look at him a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Come on -- I'm going to storm into 
                        his office in front of everybody 
                        in the afternoon and then that 
                        night I'm going to kill him?  I'd 
                        have to be really dumb to do that.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Going after him before gets you 
                        off the hook for killing him that's 
                        your alibi.

                        Like writing a book about killing 
                        a guy gets you off the hook for 
                        killing him.

          She stops.  He catches up to her.  They walk down the flights

          Only Andrews is in the room.  We see Lt. Walker sitting in his 
          glass-enclosed office.

          He closes the duffel bag, looks at the place a long beat.

                        previous repairs.  There was a

          It is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes.

          He gets out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrari there.  
          She is sitting on the front stoop.  She wears an Indian jacket, 
          jeans and a T-shirt.  He goes up to her. She looks at him a

                        You should put some warmth into

                        on your personality.

          She turns, smiles at him.  He looks at the bottle of Jack 
          Daniel's; there's not much left.

          There is a palpable tension between them.

          He takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Let me do that.  You like to watch 
                        me doing it, don't you?

          She smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick.  She takes 
          it, starts to us the icepick, her back to him.  He lights a 
          cigarette.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I have a cigarette, please?  I 
                        told you you'd start smoking again.

          He watches her working on the ice.

                        Light it for me, will you?

          He does, steps to her.  She parts her lips -- he puts it on 
          her lip, watches it.  Their eyes are on each other.

                                    CATHERINE

                        shot, Shooter?

                        My wife used to call me that.

                        I know, Nicky, but I like it.

          She hands him his drink, holds hers.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Cheers.  My friends call me

                        Bitch mostly, but he meant it 
                        affectionately.  You don't have 
                        any coke, do you?  I love coke and

                        It's not the same thing, is it?

          They look at each other a long beat, their eyes very involved.

                        want from me?

          Their faces are close together.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Say -- "What do you want from me,

                        What do you want from me, Catherine?

          A beat, and she suddenly turns away.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (brightly)
                        I brought you something.

          She goes to her purse, takes a paperback book out of it.  We 
          see it -- The First Time, by Catherine Smith.  He looks at it.

                                    CATHERINE

                        A boy kills his parents.  They 
                        have a plane.  He makes it look 
                        like an accident.

          He stares at her.  A long beat, then --

                        No.  I wrote it years afterwards.

          He watches her; she has turned away from him -- and then she 
          turns back to him in a different mood.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          As she is going down the stairs, Gus Moran is coming up.

          He does a real double-take as he goes by her.

                                    CATHERINE

          He looks at him a long beat, and he goes upstairs, into Nick's 
          apartment.

          INT. NICK'S APARTMENT

          Nick stands at the window, watching her outside.  A long beat, 
          and he looks at Gus.

                                    GUS

                        don't mean to belabor the obvious, 
                        but why is it that you've got your

                        play.

                                    GUS

                        I know what that's like.

          INT. JOHNNY BOZ'S CLUB - NIGHT

          It is dark, cavernous there are a thousand people in here.  
          The MUSIC is ear-splitting, pulsing.  Lights flash.

          The floor is huge.  At one time, this club was a church.

          He walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for 
          her.  He doesn't see her.

          The he catches a glimpse of Roxy.  She is dancing with another 
          woman.  He watches her.  She is wearing pants and a jacket, 
          her hair off to the side.  She looks very masculine tonight.

          Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts 
          moving through the sea of dancers.  He follows her through the 
          press of bodies.  She goes towards the men's room.  She walks 
          in.

          INT. THE MEN'S ROOM

          It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.

          A crowd scene men and women. Roxy presses through them.

          A haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers.

          She opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in.  Nick is behind 
          her.  As the door opens, he sees Catherine.

          She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, 
          stiletto heels.  Her hair is up.  He make-up is severe,  In 
          the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19.  A hot 19.

          A hot flash-trash 19.

          She is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body-
          built black guy.  She has a vial of something near her face.

          She sees Nick watching her.  She whispers something to the 
          tall black guy.  He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile.  
          The door to the stall closes

          INT. THE CLUB

          He is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in 
          his hand.  The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's 
          "Miss You."

          He sees her.  Her black leather jacket is off.

          She wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels.  
          She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy.  He watches her 
          move... watches her body.

          She turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between Roxy 
          and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... 
          keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with 
          her body.  He watches.

          A long beat, and he goes up to them.  His movements are

          almost trance-like.  They look at each other.  A long beat.

          Catherine stops dancing.  he reaches for her.  She moves away.  
          A beat their eyes are on each other.  She moves a step towards 
          her.  A beat, as they look at each other...  and they start to 
          move together.

          Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning... 
          the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenly grabs her and 
          kisses her... as they keep moving... the song seques into the 
          Stones's "Gimme Shelter."

          She is melting into him now, kissing him... Tex watches, 
          expressionless... the black guy is gone... he holds her by the 
          back of the neck, kissing her... their bodies pressed into 
          each other... his hands are on her butt now, pulling her into 
          him now, almost holding her up now... and then under her skirt, 
          under her panties... as he kisses her neck.

          People around them stare... he moves his hands under her top 
          as she keeps moving with the song, her head back, her back 
          almost arching... cups her breasts now... she keeps moving...  
          the song sweeping them into its rhythm "it's just a shot away, 
          it's just a kiss away, a kiss away..."

          They devour each other.  Right there on the floor.  Barely 
          able to hold it back.  As Tex watches expressionless.  As people 
          stop dancing and stare.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM

          It is dark.  We can't see clearly.  A side table, lines of 
          cocaine on a small mirror.  A CD player The Stones play "Love 
          In Vain."

          There are mirrors all over the walls and ceiling.  They are in 
          bed.  The bed is big and brass.

          Atop her... he kisses her neck... his hands under her, raising 
          her... he moves down, kisses her breasts... puts his mouth 
          around  a breast... she arches, moves... he kisses her 
          shoulder... biting into it... she opens her mouth... we hear 
          no cry... we hear the Stones.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Monkey Man."

          Atop him... she kisses his chest, licks it, lowers her head... 
          lower... lower... he arches his back... her mouth comes up... 
          her mouth on his lips again... he turns her.

          Atop her... he moves her legs apart... (the CAMERA is behind 
          them)... she holds his back... digs in her nails...  rakes his 
          back with them... digs in again... his back bleeds... he moves 
          inside her... harder... the nails dig...  blood trickles down 
          his back.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Wild Horses."

          He is behind her... she is on her stomach... he rises her by 
          her hips... kisses her back... races her spine with his 
          tongue... traces her lower back... he kneels... moves into 
          her... kisses her neck... his fingers are in her mouth...  as 
          he moves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she leans close over his face, her tongue in his 
          mouth... kneeling over him... she moves his arms above his 
          head... moves higher atop him... her breasts in his face... 
          she reaches over to the side... a white silk scarf is in her 
          hand... she moves higher above him... kneeling over his face... 
          moving oh-so-slightly... his face strains towards her.

          The scarf in both hands now... she starts to tie his hands 
          with it... his eyes are open, watching her... she ties it 
          loosely, gently... it isn't tight... but his hands are tied to 
          the brass bed.

          She kisses him... moving her hips lower now... over his chest... 
          lower...

          And he is inside her... her arms above him... his eyes open... 
          she kisses his neck... bites but not hard...  moves... grinding 
          hard against him now.. she is on her knees... head arches back.. 
          her breasts high.. still grinding.

          Her back arches, strains... he strains toward her... she holds 
          her arms high... she comes out of the arch...  shivering... 
          falling over him... the scarf loosens... his arms come forward 
          and hold her close.. closer... closer...  as she moves with 
          slight... shivery... movements.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark, quiet.  Pindrop quiet.  He is sitting on the side 
          of the bed, his head down... his back a line tracing of dried 
          blood.  She is asleep nest to him, naked.

          He looks around the room.  The white scarf around the bedpost... 
          the coke on the side-table... clothes all over the floor.

          He gets up, walks into the bathroom.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The light is too bright.  He looks at himself in the mirror.  
          He pours the water, lowers his head, puts cold water on his 
          face.  A long beat, he comes back up, opens his eyes.  Roxy is 
          in the mirror behind him.  She startles him.

          He looks at her in the mirror a long beat, doesn't turn.

          She is expressionless; she wears the same thing she wore at 
          the club.

          He lowers down into the basin again, puts more water on his 
          face, comes back up, uses a towel this time, finishes with the 
          towel.  She is still looking at him in the mirror the same 
          way.  He looks at her in the mirror, doesn't turn.

                                    ROXY
                               (quietly)
                        If you don't leave her alone, I'll 
                        kill you.

          He looks at her a beat, then turns --

                        Tell me something, Rocki.  Man-to-
                        man.
                               (he smiles)
                        I think she's the fuck of the 
                        century, don't you?

          For a second, she looks like she's going to spring at him, 
          then controls it and turns to go.

                                    NICK
                        How long you been here, Rock?  You 
                        like to watch, do you?

                                    ROXY
                               (after a beat, looks 
                               at him)
                        She likes me to watch.

          And she turns and she is gone.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.  He is on his back, 
          his eyes open.  He has his arm around her.  She is asleep.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (murmurs)
                        Nicky.

          He looks at her.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - MORNING

          He wakes up.  She is not there.  He looks around.  The white 
          scarf is gone.  The coke on the side table is gone.

          In its place, a scrawled note "The Beach -- C."

          EXT. HER STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY

          A cold and foggy day.  He gets out of his old Porsche, walks 
          down the driveway.  He sees her out on the beach by the water.  
          A small bonfire is near her.  He walks towards her.

          Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of 
          the house.  He doesn't see her.

          He walks up to Catherine.  She has an Indian blanket over her 
          and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose 
          underneath.

                                    NICK
                               (expressionless)
                        'Morning.

          She doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly.  She doesn't smile 
          and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either.  She walks 
          along the beach.  He walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        I think Roxy got jealous.

          She looks at him.  He looks like he is trying to hide a smile.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        She's seen me fuck plenty of other 
                        guys.

          That wipes the hidden smile off his face.  He looks at her, 
          walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        Maybe she saw something she didn't 
                        see before.

                                    CATHERINE

          She looks at him; he's smiling now.

                        century.

          He can't hide his smile anymore.  She says nothing, keeps 
          walking.

          She looks at him.

          A beat, and she walks away towards the house.  He watches her.

          INT. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR - NIGHT

          Nick walks in.  Waylon Jennings is on the JUKEBOX.  Gus is

          angrily away from them, drinks more coffee.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; 
                               quietly)
                        I'm not afraid of her.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        Why the hell not?

                                    NICK
                        I don't know.  I'm just not.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        That's her pussy talkin' --He gets 
                        a real nasty look from a very fat 
                        woman eating a cheeseburger.  He 
                        winks at her.  The woman looks 
                        away from him, shaking her head.

                                    GUS
                               (smiles; to Nick)
                        It ain't your brain.

          They look at each other a long beat.  Gus drinks more coffee.  
          He sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes.

          A long beat.

                                    GUS
                               (quietly)
                        I.A. done did a track on Lt. Martin 
                        D for Dickhead Nilsen.  They found 
                        a safety deposit box with fifty-
                        thousand dollars in it, taken out 
                        three months ago, used that one 
                        time.

          He looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely.

          She looks away.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        It doesn't make sense.  She didn't 
                        know me three months ago.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.
                        Maybe the money was for somethin' 
                        else.  How the fuck do I know?  
                        I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' 
                        not to fall outta his saddle.

          Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, 
          he's completely preoccupied.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is watching as he and Gus come out of the diner.

          EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

          He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted, vintage 
          Cadillac.

                                    NICK
                        You all right, pop?  You want me 
                        to drive you?

                                    GUS
                        In that little pissant car of yours?  
                        Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back 
                        pain disability retirement -- I'm 
                        gettin' me a full pension and a 
                        real gold-plate Seiko watch.

                                    NICK
                        Come on, I'll drive you in this 
                        thing.                                                                     

                                    GUS
                        You think I'd let you drive my 
                        Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no 
                        hear-up-his-ass person drive my 
                        Cadillac car.

          And he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcing Nick 
          to get out of the way.  Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes 
          his head.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street.  
          He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, 
          parked behind the country and western bar.

          The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from the back, 
          full bore.

          EXT. THE ALLEY

          He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding 
          the car.  He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out 
          It is a black Ferrari.

          INT. HIS PORSCHE

          He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction 
          the Ferrari turned.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping 
          them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          He sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it 
          turned, he turns wildly.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in 
          North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining 
          ground behind it, making turns.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a 
          road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard.

          EXT. THE STEPS

          The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the 
          air, almost out of control.                                                                     

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          As it crests the steps and gets to the street.  Nick GUNS it 
          and it looks like it flies high down the hill-side into 
          blackness.

          EXT. THE STREET

          But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, 
          almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Another set of steps leading up he GUNS it, it rockets up, 
          ROARS, bucking --

          EXT. THE STREET

          And lands on the next street.  Nick makes a wild right turn 
          onto the street.  And the black Ferrari appears from around a 
          curve to the right, heading right for him.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari.

          The Ferrari SCREAMS head-on for him.

          EXT. THE STREET

          And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari 
          tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of 
          control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls 
          down the hillside.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE

          The Ferrari has landed right-side up.

          He runs down the hillside and gets to it.  A beat, and he opens 
          the car door.

          Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open.  Her neck is 
          broken.  She is dead.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE - NIGHT

          Police lights have been set up.  He stands there with Lt.  
          Walker and several of the Internal Affairs men.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Tell me again.  I want to hear you 
                        say it again.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; 
                               sheepish)
                        It was an accident.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You're driving around North Beach 
                        for no particular reason and this 
                        car won't get out of the way --

                                    NICK
                        I don't think she meant to go off 
                        the hill, do you?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't 
                        need a reason to put your ass in a 
                        sling.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat.  Andrews comes up 
          to them with a piece of paper in his hand.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Full name, Roxanne Hardy.  Last 
                        address -- Cloverdale, California.  
                        No priors, no convictions.  The 
                        car is registered to Catherine 
                        Tramell.

          Lt. Walker looks at Nick like he's going to kill him.  Nick 
          looks calmly away.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You knew her, didn't you?

                                    NICK
                        Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's 
                        house.  All we did was write her 
                        name down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        I told you to stay away from 
                        Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; smiles)
                        Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to 
                        stay away from her car.

          Walker looks at him in absolute disbelief.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        I want you in Dr. Gardner's office 
                        at nine o'clock.  You're out of 
                        control, Curran.

                                    NICK
                               (to the I.A. Man)
                        Who are you guys gonna sell my 
                        file to this time?

          They stare at him.  He watches as Roxy's body is taken away.

          INT. A POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM -DAY

          He walks in.  He looks good, in control.  Beth Gardner is 
          sitting there with two middle-aged MEN, both of them wearing 
          suits, who smile and scrutinize him the instant he walks in 
          the door.

                                    BETH
                        Hello, Nick.  This is Dr. Myron 
                        and R. McElwaine.  They've been 
                        asked to consult with me on this 
                        evaluation.

          They shake hands with him.

                                    DR. MYRON
                        Sit down, Nick.

          Nick gives him a look: What did he think he was going to do -- 
          stand there?

          He sits down, looks at them.  A beat, as they look at him, 
          then --

                                    DR. MCELWAINE
                               (courtly)
                        Nick -- when you recollect your 
                        childhood, are your recollections 
                        pleasing to you?

          Nick looks at them a long beat in disbelief.

                                    NICK
                               (calmly, directly)
                        Number one I don't remember how 
                        often I used to jack off, but it 
                        was a lot.  Number two I didn't 
                        get pissed off at my dad -- even 
                        after I was old enough to know 
                        what he and mom were doing in the 
                        bedroom.  Number three I don't 
                        look in the toilet before I flush 
                        it.  Number four I don't wet the 
                        bed and haven't for some time.
                        Number five You can go fuck 
                        yourselves because I'm out of here.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR

          He is walking away quickly.  Beth is with him, trying to keep 
          up.  She is very angry.

                                    BETH
                        What is your problem?  I'm trying 
                        to help you.  Why won't you let me 
                        help you?

                                    NICK
                        I don't need any help.

                                    BETH
                        Yes you do.  Something's on with 
                        you.
                               (a beat)
                        You're sleeping with her, aren't 
                        you?

          A beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking.

                                    NICK
                        What is this interest you've got 
                        in her?

                                    BETH
                        My interest is in you, not in her.
                        She seduces people, she manipulates --

                                    NICK
                        I thought you hardly know her.

                                    BETH
                        I know the type.  I'm a 
                        psychologist.

          He stops, looks at her.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        That means you manipulate people 
                        too, doesn't it, Beth?  You're a 
                        practicing psychologist -- that 
                        means you're better at it than she 
                        is.

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (quietly)
                        I feel sorry for you, Nick.

          Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.  He is 
          driving very fast, passing other cars on the winding and 
          twisting road.

          Nick enters and shuts door.  Looking around, he does not see 
          her.

                        Catherine!

          Finally he sees her sitting by the window.  He walks over to 
          her.

                               (near tears)
                        I should have known.  I came into 
                        the house when you were down on 
                        the beach.  She looked at me so 
                        strangely.  She left right after 
                        you.

                        time.  She tried to kill you, didn't 
                        she?

                        once.  She started following me 
                        around, taking my picture.  She 
                        dyed her hair, copied my clothes.
                        Lisa something... Oberman.  It was 
                        awful.

                        I'd read about your shootings in 
                        the papers.  I decided to write a 
                        book about a detective.  I wanted 
                        to know my character.

                        know everything about you.  Then 
                        you came down here after Johnny 
                        got killed... it gave me a chance

          And she kisses him slowly, with more and more heat, on the 
          lips.

          The cordless phone on the deck table goes off.  It keeps 
          RINGING.  She breaks finally from the kiss, picks it up.

                        It sure makes you wonder what they 
                        talked about when they set 
                        themselves down in front of the 
                        campfire at night.   You ever met 
                        any of her friends who hasn't killed 
                        somebody.

          A young woman is checking a computer.  Nick is with her.

          She gives him a look, but punches it in again.

          Catherine comes out of the house with Hazel Dobkins, the old 
          woman we saw with her in Mill Valley.  Nick watches them a 
          beat, then goes up to them.

                        Hazel , this is Nick.  I told you 
                        all about him.  This is Hazel 
                        Dobkins.

                        How are you?

          He looks at her a long beat.

                                    NICK
                        Fine.  Thank you.

                        Honey, why don't you go in the 
                        car?  I'll be right there.

          The old woman starts going to the Ferrari.

                                    HAZEL
                               (brightly)
                        Goodbye, Shooter.

          Nick looks at Hazel a beat, then at Catherine.

                                    NICK
                        You like to hang out with murderers 
                        or what?  Did you know Roxy --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Of course I knew.

                        too.

          She smiles.  He looks at her, doesn't know what to say.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Killing isn't like smoking.  You 
                        can quit.

          He looks at her What did she say?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (preoccupied)

                        her home by six o'clock.  She just 
                        loves "America's Most Wanted."

          America's Most Wanted?  She turns to go.

                        What were you doing, checking up 
                        on me?  What for?

          He says nothing.  A long beat, she looks hurt.

                        It's not gonna take long, Sam.

          We see the computer screen.  The screen says LISA HENDERSON  
          DMV LICENSE CHECK We wait and then we see the words 1983 RENEWAL -- 
          ELIZABETH GARDNER, 147 QUEENSTON DRIVE, SALINAS, CAL.

          Nick stares at the screen.

                                    NICK

          A beat, and the license comes up.  We see a young Beth Gardner

                        I didn't.  Something's wrong with 
                        my lock.

          A beat, she looks at him.

                        She told you, didn't she?

                        I slept with her once in school.
                               (a beat)
                        I was just a kid.  I was 
                        experimenting.  It was just that 
                        one time.
                               (a beat)
                        She developed a... fixation... on 
                        me.  She styled her hair like mine.  
                        She wore the same kind of clothes 
                        I did.  It scared me.

          She looks at him, sees his look.

                                    BETH

                        She told me it was you.  You wore 
                        the same kind of clothes.  You 
                        dyed your hair blonde.

          A long beat as they look at each other.

                                    BETH
                        I did dye my hair.  It didn't have 
                        anything to do with her.  I was a 
                        redhead for a while, too.

                        I was embarrassed.  It's the only

          She turns to him.

                        knows I went to Berkeley.  She 
                        knows I knew Noah.  She makes up 
                        that story about me.  She's handing 
                        you somebody who's obsessed with

                        She didn't hand you to me.  She

                        She knew you'd find out who Lisa 
                        Henderson is.  You're a good cop --
                        what did she do?  Tell you casually 
                        and make it seem irrelevant?
                               (she smiles)
                        Did she tell you in bed, Nick?

                        down to the campus  police and 
                        made out a report about her.

                        I had another one of you guys down 
                        here from Frisco -- about a year 
                        ago -- he asked me the same 
                        question.  What's this about anyway?

                                    NICK
                        Routine.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        Yeah, he said it was routine too.
                        Now it's two guys saying it's 
                        routine.

                                    NICK
                        Do you remember his name?

                                    DETECTIVE
                               (after a long beat)
                        Nope, can't say that I do.

                        Nilsen?

                                    DETECTIVE
                        That's him.

          A long beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Was she ever a suspect?

                                    DETECTIVE
                        Nope.
                               (a beat)
                        There was some talk; it never 
                        panned.

                                    NICK
                        What kind of talk?

                                    DETECTIVE
                        The usual -- a girlfriend.

                                    NICK
                        He had a girlfriend?

                                    DETECTIVE
                        Nope. She did.
                               (a beat)
                        Like I say.  It never panned.

                        I hope I helped you out.

                        You did.

          EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - AFTERNOON

          He walks around the house; he sees her sitting out on the deck, 
          a portable word-processor in front of her.  She is smoking.

          He goes up to her.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        Hi.  I missed you.  I finished my 
                        research.

          He moves toward her.  She moves away, kills her cigarette.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I finished my book.

                                    NICK
                        How did it end?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        I told you.  She kills him.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Goodbye, Nick.

          He stares at her.  A long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I finished my book.

                        Goodbye.

          He stares at her.  He can't believe what she is saying.

                                    CATHERINE
                        What do you want, Nick?  Flowers?  
                        I'll send you some flowers.

                        What is this -- some kind of...
                        Joke?
                               (a beat; he almost 
                               smiles)
                        Are we playing games again?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        The games are over.  You were right.  
                        It was the fuck of the century, 
                        Shooter.

          He stares at her.

                                    A VOICE INSIDE
                        Catherine?

          Nick looks -- Hazel Dobkins is there.

          Catherine still has her eyes on him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Right there.

          A beat, and then she turns to go inside.  Hazel Dobkins smiles 
          slowly at him.

          EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK

          He sits in his Porsche, staring ahead.  He is parked next to 
          Gus' Cadillac.  Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car.

                                    GUS
                               (excited)
                        Catherine Tramell's roommate her 
                        freshman year.  I got a call from 
                        her.  I've been calling people who 
                        were in her dorm all day.  She 
                        must've heard I was trying to talk 
                        to her.  She says she knows all 
                        about Catherine and Lisa Henderson.  
                        She's over in Oakland.  You wanna 
                        come with me?

          Nick just stares ahead.

                                    GUS
                        You look like you seen a ghost, 
                        son?

          Nick looks at him.

          INT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Gus drives.

                                    GUS
                               (excited)
                        Johnny Boz's psychiatrist has an 
                        office on Van Ness.  Guess who he 
                        shares office space with?  Dr.  
                        Elizabeth Gardner.

          Nick doesn't even respond.  Gus looks at him.

                                    GUS
                        What in hell's the matter with 
                        you?

          Nick doesn't say anything, stares ahead.

          EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING - OAKLAND - NIGHT

          Gus gets out with Nick.  It is an old building.

                                    GUS
                        Where the hell you goin'?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        I'm going with you.

                                    GUS
                        She said alone -- suite 405.  It 
                        ain't gonna take long.

          A beat, and Nick gets back in the car.

          INT. THE OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

          Gus is on the first floor.  There is no one around.  He hits 
          the elevator button.  A beat, and it comes.  He steps in.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          He hits the button for the fourth floor.

          The elevator rises a floor, stops.  The door opens.  There is 
          no one there.  Then it starts going up again.  It rises to the 
          third floor.  It stops.  The door opens.  There is no one there.  
          Then it starts to rise again.

          EXT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Nick sits there, staring ahead.

                                    NICK
                               (suddenly, screaming)
                        Gus!

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          As it goes up.  It stops.  The door starts to open.  As it 
          does -- a figure in a hooded raincoat sweeps into the elevator.  
          It happens very fast.  We see blonde hair around the face.

          But we don't see the face itself -- the head is down, the hood 
          up.  There is an icepick in the figure's hand.  The figure 
          explodes into Gus.  The icepick goes into his neck.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          Nick tears desperately up the stairway -- he hits the fourth 
          floor door.  It explodes open.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He stands there a beat, sees the elevator door open.  He runs 
          there,  He sees Gus, crumpled into the corner of the elevator.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          He goes into the elevator -- holds Gus.  He is dead.  A long 
          beat.  He sees the gun in Gus' hand -- he takes the gun out of 
          his hand.  He runs out of the elevator.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He hears something.  Gun in hand, he runs towards the SOUND.  
          He stops, gun in hand, listens again.  He runs again, hears 
          nothing.

          Behind him, we see a figure.

          He spins suddenly, gun, in hand.  Beth Gardner is there.

          She wears a windbreaker.  She has her hands in the pockets.

                                    BETH
                        What are you doing here?

                                    NICK
                               (screaming)
                        Put your hands up!

          She stares at him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Put your fucking hands up!  Don't 
                        move.

                                    BETH
                        I got a message on my machine to 
                        meet Gus here.  Where is he?

          She smiles a strange smile.  She takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Don't!
                               (a beat)
                        I know about your husband.  You 
                        still like girls, Beth?

                                    BETH
                        What?

          She smiles strangely again, takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Take your hands out of your pockets!

          She moves a hand in a pocket and moves towards him fast --

                                    BETH
                        What is wrong with you?

          And he FIRES the gun.  She is hit in the chest, goes down.

          A long beat, and then he goes to her.  He gets down on the 
          ground.  Her eyes are open.  He empties the pockets of the 
          windbreaker -- first one, then the other the pockets are empty.

                                    BETH
                               (in a whisper)
                        I loved you.

          And she dies.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR - LATER

          A lot of policemen, coroner's guys, photos being taken.

          Nick stands there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, and some of the 
          Internal Affairs guys.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (upset)
                        What made you think she had a gun?

          Nick says nothing; he looks like a zombie.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What the hell was she doing here?  
                        What was Gus doing here?  

          Andrews yells to them from the stairway door.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Lieutenant.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          A FORENSICS MAN very carefully handles a hooded rain coat in a 
          stair landing.  He wears gloves.

          Nick is there with Lt. Walker.

          The Forensics Man picks the raincoat up -- a long blonde wig 
          falls out of it.  There are flecks of blood on it.

          He reaches into the pocket and pulls out an  icepick.  It has 
          a thin steel handle and is bloody.  He hands the icepick to an 
          assistant.

          He looks at the raincoat.  It has blood on it.

                                    THE FORENSICS MAN
                        It's departmental issue.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Jesus.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Nick with Lt. Walker.  Nick looks like a zombie.  Andrews comes 
          up to them.  He has a gun in his hands.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

                        Have  ballistics check it for 
                        Nilsen.

          Harrigan comes out.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        Lieutenant, you'd better come in 
                        here.

          Lt. Walker goes into the kitchen.  Nick follows him.

          There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet.  A drawer is 
          open.

          Walker looks -- we look with him.  We see a copy of Love hurts, 
          Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine.

          Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots 
          of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine 
          with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy.

          He hands the photos to Nick.

          Nick stares at them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I guess that's it.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          Nick sits, his feet up.  He looks like a zombie.  With him are 
          Lt. Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott.  We see other 
          plainclothesmen in the b.g. -- a flurry of activity, people on 
          phones.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She must've heard you on the 
                        stairway and dumped the stuff.

          Nick says nothing, stares off.

          A DETECTIVE comes over to them.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        There was no suite 405 in that 
                        building.  Catherine Tramell's 
                        roommate in her freshman year is 
                        dead.  She died of leukemia two 
                        years ago.

          An INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN comes over to them.

                                    INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN
                        Our files on Dr. Gardner show 
                        nothing about a police report in 
                        Berkeley -- nothing related to 
                        Salinas, either.

          A long beat -- the phone RINGS.  Andrews picks it up, listens.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thanks.

          He hangs up.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Ballistics says the .38 we found 
                        in her apartment matches Nilsen.  
                        No registration.  They're checking 
                        with Salinas.  The icepick is the 
                        same brand and model as the Boz 
                        weapon.

          A long beat -- Nick just stares.

          Harrigan comes up to them.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        We checked the tape machines at 
                        Dr.  Gardner's apartment and at 
                        her office -- both here and the 
                        one on Van Ness.  No message from 
                        Gus on any of 'em.  The one at her 
                        apartment was broken.
                               (a beat)
                        Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he 
                        thinks he remembers Dr. Gardner 
                        and Boz meeting at a Christmas 
                        party at his house a year ago.

          A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a long beat, 
                               sadly)
                        You just can't tell about people, 
                        can you.  Even the ones you think 
                        you know inside-out.

          He and Nick look at each other a beat.

                                    CAPTAIN TALCOTT
                        Congratulations, Curran.

          Nick looks at him, expressionless.

          EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He parks his car.  It is dark.  Foggy.

          He starts heading inside.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He goes in.  He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see 
          him walking up several flights of steps.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT

          He opens his door with his key.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT

          He walks in.  The apartment is dark.

                                    A VOICE
                               (behind him)
                        Hi.

          It is a whisper, almost a hiss.  He spins, fast.  Catherine 
          stands there, pressing herself against a wall.  They look at 
          each other a long beat.  She looks like she is almost in a 
          trance.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I heard about it... on TV.

          He looks at her, expressionless.  A long beat, their eyes are 
          into each other.  She looks like she is almost shivering.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I can't allow myself to care about 
                        you -- I can't allow myself to 
                        care -- I can't -- I can't --

          She looks very emotional.  He moves towards her, puts his arms 
          around her, holds her very close.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I don't want to do this -- please --
                        I don't want to do this -- I lose 
                        everybody -- I don't want to lose 
                        you -- I don't want to --

          He presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her.

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we can't see clearly.

          Atop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly...  
          hardly moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          Atop him... she is on her knees, straddling him... he is on 
          his back, his eyes are closed... her head arches back...  her 
          breasts high... he strains toward her with his body...  she 
          holds her arms high... her right hand is in a fist...

          (we only see the back of her hand and arm)... it comes down 
          suddenly... he bucks... writhes... then her whole body falls 
          on top of him.

          A very long beat...

          We can't see him... her body completely covers him...

          And then finally he moves... turns her to the side...  kisses 
          her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy For The Devil"  in the b.g.; the 
          MUSIC is low.

          They lie next to each other on the bed.  The CAMERA faces them.  
          He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side of the bed, 
          smoking a cigarette.  She is curled away from him toward the 
          right side of the bed.  A long beat, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        What do we do now, Nick?

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We raise 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over.  
          He stares at the ceiling.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I hate rugrats.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We forget the 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now Her face 
          is expressionless.  Her right arm dangles over the right side 
          of the bed.  Her right hand is clenched.  Is she holding 
          something in it against her arm?

          We see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now: He 
          turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette.

          We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the CAMERA.  
          A beat, and he turns towards her.

          They look at each other.  A long beat as the SONG gets louder.  
          We see them in CLOSEUP.  We don't see her right arm.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I love you.

          A beat, and he kisses her.  The CAMERA BACKS AWAY from them 
          slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we --

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

          ... A long beat, as the SONG keeps playing... and we...

          FADE IN:

          We see them from the right side of the bedroom.  And then the 
          CAMERA LOWERS SLOWLY as they kiss with more and more passion.

          It keeps going LOWER.

          There is something under the bed.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER 
          towards it as "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" plays louder.  We see 
          it now in CLOSEUP as the bed rustles above...

          It is a thin, steel-handled icepick.

          The SONG plays LOUDER and LOUDER, and we --

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                     THE END

    BLACK                                                        

     We hear a clock ticking.

                                                      FADE IN:

    INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY                  
     Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the
     center of what seems to be a makeshift "meditation" space.

     We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55).
     He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight
     white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all
     this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you
     notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor.
     His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out.

                         MAN (V.O.)
               How did we end up here?
                   (Beat.)
               This place is a fucking dump.

     We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure
     breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking.

                         MAN (V.O.)
               Smells like balls.

     A slight twitch in Riggan's neck.

                         MAN (V.O.)
               We don't belong in this shithole.

     A Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow
     Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call.
     On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's
     and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good
     looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. She
     stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan
     through her iPhone.

1A                                                                1A

     The Korean Store owner (50) stands in the background screaming
     at her the whole time.

                         RIGGAN
               Sam, I can't--



                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                     10/29/14   /   2.

                         SAM
              Dad? What kind of--
                  (Turning to Korean.)
              SHUT UP!!!
                  (Back to screen.)
              What kind of flowers did you say you
              wanted?

                        RIGGAN
              Alchemillas. Or something soothing that
              smells nice. Listen I can't--
                        SAM
              It all smells like fucking Kimchi!

                        RIGGAN
              Then whatever looks nice. Anything but
              roses. No roses.

                        KOREAN
              Flowers don't need you touch! They need you
              buy!!!

                        SAM
                  (Close into the screen.)
              I hate this job.

    And the Skype call is over. Riggan closes the laptop and leans
    forward trying to regain his calm. His reflection appears in
    the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. He has a
    dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. There is a
    piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase "A
    thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing."

                        ANNIE ON SPEAKERS
              Riggan, they're starting scene
              five. We need you on stage.

                        RIGGAN
              Shit...
    Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He
    hurries out...

   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            

    ...through the narrow corridors of the theater. There is a lot
    of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and
    disappear carrying equipment and scenery. As Riggan descends the
    stairs, a Stage Hand� passes by in the opposite direction.

                        STAGE HAND�
              Mr. Thomson.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                    10/29/14   /   3.

                        RIGGAN
              Steve.

                        STAGE HAND�
              It's Daniel.

                        RIGGAN
                  (Already passed.)
              Okay.

    Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage. He runs into
    Jake (42) his producer and friend.

                        JAKE
              How's it going, buddy.

                        RIGGAN
              Great. It'd be even better if I
              could get Ralph to stop acting like
              he's in an educational video for
              syphilis...
    The camera moves off of them and onto...

   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                              
    ...the stage. Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style
    kitchen.

    Around the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense,
    her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she
    is. Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every
    person she meets feel like she's seducing them. And Ralph (40),
    slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible.

    A half empty bottle of gin on the table, they drink from
    highball glasses as they chat...

                        LESLEY
              He loved me.

                        RALPH
              Yeah. He loved her so much he tried
              to kill her.

                        LAURA
              He tried to kill you?

                        LESLEY
              No. (A beat.) Okay, well, he did
              beat me up one night. He dragged me
              around the living room by my
              ankles, yelling "I love you, I love
                        (MORE)

                    LESLEY (CONT'D)
          you, bitch." What do you do with a
          love like that?

                    RALPH
          How is that-- That is not love and you know
          it. Why do you insist on calling it--

                    LESLEY
          You can say what you want, but I know what
          it was.
                    RALPH
          What about you, Nick? Does that sound like
          love to you?

Riggan arrives at the table and sits.

                    RIGGAN
          Sorry I'm late.
              (Beat. In character.)
          I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
          know the man. I've only heard his name
          mentioned in passing. You'd have to
          know the particulars. But I think what
          you're saying is that love is absolute.

                    RALPH
          Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about
          is... The kind of love I'm talking about,
          you don't try and kill people.

                    LESLEY
              (Sadly.)
          It was love, Mel. To Eddie, it was. I don't
          care what anybody says. He was ready to die
          for it.

                    RALPH
          Ask her what he did after she left him.

                    LESLEY
          He shot himself in the mouth. But he
          screwed that up, too. Poor Ed.

                    RALPH
          Poor Ed, my ass. The guy was dangerous.

                     LAURA
          How'd he screw it up if he shot himself in
          the mouth?

                    RALPH
              (By the numbers.)
          He used to carry this twenty-two. We lived
          like fugitives those days. I never knew--

                                                 10/29/14   /   5.

                    RIGGAN
              (Breaking character to direct.
               Exasperated.)
          Okay. Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. How
          many times do I have to-- Fugitives are
          scared. Give me more of that.

Ralph nods. He takes a breath and dives in once again...

                    RALPH
              (The same but louder.)
          We lived like fugitives those days...

Extremely frustrated, Riggan stares out into the auditorium.
From his POV we see Jake who is now sitting in the third row.
His head buried in his hands, tortured by Ralph's performance.
Riggan turns back to Ralph.

                    RALPH (CONT'D)
          ...I never knew if he was going to come out
          of the bushes or from behind a car and just
          start shooting.

Riggan watches Ralph act and sees his whole production headed
down the drain. Ralph is just that bad.

                    RALPH (CONT'D)
          The man was crazy. He was capable of
          anything.

The actors all wait for a cue from Riggan, who is now staring
up into the lights above the stage. Laura finally picks up
Riggan's cue.

                    LAURA
          Christ. What a nightmare...

                    RALPH
          He used to call me at the hospital and
          say...
              (Over the top.)
          "Son of a bitch. Your days are numbered."

Silence. Ralph looks over to Riggan.

                    RALPH (CONT'D)
          Too much? Little bit? I just wanted to give
          you a range, so you could--

And with that a light comes barreling down from it's perch and
crashes into Ralph's head, making him hit the floor like a rag
doll. Silence.

                       LAURA
          Holy shit.
                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                  10/29/14    /   6.

    Lesley and Annie (35), the Stage Manager, run over to Ralph
    who is out cold. Not knowing what to do, they stare at him.

                        LESLEY
              Is he breathing?

    Jake runs toward the stage.

                        JAKE
              Someone call 911!
    Riggan slowly backs away from the chaos.

                        LAURA
              Is that blood coming out of his
              ear?

                        JAKE
                  (To Riggan.)
              Where are you going?
                        LESLEY
              Okay, he's breathing. What did he
              have for lunch?

                        LAURA
              Did anyone call for help?

                        ANNIE
                  (Clapping.)
              Wake up! Wake up!

    Two crew members try to help Ralph.

                        CREW MEMBER
              Grab his legs. I got the top.

                        JAKE
              Don't move him! Wait for the ambulance.
                  (Calling out.)
              For the love of God! I could get a black
              audience in this theater faster than a
              doctor!

    Riggan heads off the stage, and Jake chases after him. We
    follow them as...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           

    ...they walk through the corridor.

                        JAKE
              Where are you going? We'll have the
              understudy ready to rehearse in five--

                    RIGGAN
          Forget the understudy. We have to postpone
          the preview.

                    JAKE
          What are you-- It's a full house. We would
          have to refund all the--

                    RIGGAN
          Then do it.
A crew member� passes in the opposite direction.

                    CREW MEMBER�
          How's Ralph?

                    RIGGAN
          He'll be fine.

                    JAKE
          Wait. Wait. Fuck. Wait.
                    RIGGAN
          Listen to me. It was going to be a
          disaster. That guy's the worst actor I've
          ever seen. The blood coming out of his ear
          was the most honest thing he's done so far.

                    JAKE
          He's not that bad.

Riggan stops in his tracks and stares at Jake.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Okay, he's fucking horrible. But--

Riggan starts walking again.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          You have the press in your dressing
          room in a few hours. How are we--
                    RIGGAN
          I'll make something up.

Two Technicians� hurry up in the opposite direction.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Jake. This happened for a reason. It wasn't
          an accident.

                    JAKE
          What do you mean?

                        RIGGAN
              I-- (A beat.) I made it happen.

                        JAKE
              Oh. Okay.
                  (Beat.)
              Are you drunk?

                        RIGGAN
              Find me an actor. A good actor.
              Philip Seymour Hoffman...
                        JAKE
              He's doing the third Hunger Games.

                        RIGGAN
              Michael Fassbender?

                        JAKE
              Doing the prequel to the X-Men
              prequel.
    They arrive at Riggan's dressing room.

                        RIGGAN
              What's his name? Jeremy Renner...

                        JAKE
              Who?

                        RIGGAN
              The... the Hurt Locker guy.

                        JAKE
              Yeah. He's an Avenger.

                        RIGGAN
                  (With disgust.)
              Fuck. They put him in a cape, too?
              (A beat.) Look, I don't care. Find
              me someone.
    Riggan enters...

   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS            

    ...his dressing room and tries to shut the door. Jake, still in
    the corridor, stops it with his foot.

                        JAKE
                  (Sticking his head in.)
              Ralph'll sue us. He'll sue us. And he's got
              a case.

Riggan releases the door.

                    RIGGAN
          Then make him go away.

                    JAKE
          How do you suggest I do that?

                      RIGGAN
          You're my   lawyer, my producer and
          my oldest   friend. We are going to
          make this   work. Now just get out
          there and   do what you were born to
          do.

                    JAKE
          What's that?

                    RIGGAN
          I have no idea. But I have faith.
          Now go away from me.
                    JAKE
          Do you think we should--

Riggan slams the door shut on Jake. A beat. On a television, a
segment of E! News. A busty blond, with an exaggerated smile,
hosts.

                    BLOND WOMAN
          ...and when we come back, an exclusive
          interview with Robert Downey Jr., who tells
          us about the billion-dollar Iron Man
          franchise. The talented actor invited us
          onto the set of Iron Man 3...

Riggan slams the tv off, his mind racing. He sits on a chair.

                    MAN (V.O.)
          That clown doesn't have half your talent
          and he's making a fortune in that Tin Man
          get up.

Riggan stares into the mirror, in the reflection he catches
sight of a poster from a movie called "Birdman 3". The
superhero, Birdman (a younger Riggan in a bird costume), wings
widely spread, stares directly back at him. A hand written
note on the top of the poster reads: "Thomson, break a wing!
From the boys at Local 1." Riggan tries to calm himself with a
mantra...

                    RIGGAN
          "Breathing in, I embrace my anger.
          Breathing out, I smile to it."

                    BIRDMAN (V.O.)
          Embrace it. Kiss it. Turn it around and
          fuck it in the--

A knock on the door behind him.

                      RIGGAN
          Not now!

Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.
                    LAURA
          Can I come in?

                      RIGGAN
          No.

                    LAURA
          Okay. Two words. Shia La Beouf.

                    RIGGAN
          That's three words.

                      LAURA
          It's two.

                      RIGGAN
          Get out.

                    LAURA
          I love you.

She closes the door. Riggan tries to calm himself down, but
Laura opens the door again.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          I take it we're not going to dinner
          anymore?

                    RIGGAN
          I don't have an actor.
                    LAURA
          I don't have a life.

                      RIGGAN
          Laura...

                    LAURA
          Fine. Whatever.
              (Goes to leave but stops.)
          You remember at Joan's when you
          asked me to come do a Broadway play
          with you? You said it would be
          fun...
                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                  10/29/14     /   11.

                          RIGGAN
               Go away.

                         LAURA
               So far? No fun.

     Riggan closes the door and looks at the Birdman poster.

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               Fun? You know what would be fun? Getting
               the fuck out of here before we humiliate
               ourselves. That would be fun.

     Riggan looks at himself in the mirror and begins to pull at
     his hair. As it comes off his head, we discover it was a wig.
     He turns away from the mirror, trying desperately to stay
     calm. Something catches his eye: a vase of roses on the end
     of the table. A card in them says, "They didn't have the
     whatever you wanted - Sam". Enraged, Riggan focuses on the
     vase. It begins to shift. Then, with a surge of anger,
     without ever touching it, he sends it crashing against the
     wall on the other side of the room.

     The camera pans over the roses scattered across the floor. It
     hovers over the carpet and around the perimeter of the room,
     until it finally settles on Riggan, now dressed in a casual
     blazer.

A5                                                                 A5

     It is later the same day. He is sitting on the sofa and on three
     chairs in front of him are three journalists:

     Gabriel, a geeky theatre journalist, wearing thick glasses and
     a thin tie. Clara, a reporter from an entertainment blog. And
     Han, a polite, obese Japanese journalist, who sits next to his
     translator, another Japanese guy.

                         GABRIEL
               Why does somebody go from playing the lead
               in a comic book franchise to adapting
               Raymond Carver for the stage?

     Riggan tries to remain calm.

                         GABRIEL (CONT'D)
               I mean, as you're probably aware, Barthes
               said, "The cultural work done in the past
               by gods and epic sagas is now done by
               laundry detergent commercials and comic
               strip characters." It's a big leap you've
               taken...

     Riggan shifts nervously.

                    RIGGAN
          Well... Absolutely. As you said... that
          Barthes said... Birdman, like Icarus...

                    CLARA
          Hang on. Who's this Barthes guy? Which
          Birdman was he in?

                    GABRIEL
          Roland Barthes was a French philosopher,
          who--
                    CLARA
          Oh. Okay. Sure. Now, is it true you've been
          injecting yourself with semen from baby
          pigs?

                    RIGGAN
          What?

                    CLARA
          As a method of facial rejuvenation.

                    RIGGAN
          Who told you that?

                    CLARA
          It was tweeted by... (checks her notes)
          @prostatewhispers.

                    RIGGAN
          It's a lie.

                    CLARA
          I know. But did you do it?

                    RIGGAN
          No!

                    GABRIEL
          Are you afraid at all that people will say
          you're doing this play to battle the
          impression that you're a washed-up super
          hero?

                     RIGGAN
          No. I'm not. And that's exactly why
          20 years ago I refused to do
          Birdman 4.

                    HAN
          Birdman 4??? You do Birdman 4???

Jake opens the door and the camera pans to him.

                    JAKE
          Okay. That's enough for today.
          Thank you for coming. We're
          expecting some great pieces from
          you...

Riggan stares at the Birdman poster.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Publicity guys are trying to get
          you a Times feature.
Riggan stands up and pulls the Birdman poster off of the
wall.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          So, How'd it-- Whoa. If I were you
          I wouldn't do that.

                    RIGGAN
          I don't want to look at it anymore.
                    JAKE
          That was a present from the crew.
          Don't fuck with those guys, they're
          union.

                    RIGGAN
          I don't care.

Riggan leaves the poster on the floor, facing the wall, and
walks to the window. He opens it. We can hear distant drums
coming from the street.

                    JAKE
          So... How'd it go?

                    RIGGAN
          Great.

                    JAKE
              (Worried.)
          Did they ask about Ralph?

                    RIGGAN
          Nope.

                    JAKE
          Good. He did it, you know? The
          motherfucker threatened to sue us.
          Didn't even wait to get out of the
          hospital.

                    RIGGAN
          And, what did you say?
                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                     10/29/14   /   14.

                         JAKE
               What'd I say? I said, "You
               motherfucker. You're threatening
               me? ME? I swear to god, you fuck, I
               so much as get a letter from a
               lawyer, the press'll get the
               pictures we got off your computer."

                         RIGGAN
               What pictures?
                         JAKE
               The guy has a thing for nuns... in
               diapers. What do you care? You
               shouldn't have any knowledge about
               it anyway. The important thing is
               that I made him go away.

                         RIGGAN
               Right. That's great.
                         JAKE
               Yeah, it's fantastic. One problem.
               We don't have an actor. And if we
               cancel the first preview the press
               will smell the blood. We can't
               afford to lose any more money. At
               all.

                         RIGGAN
               What do you want me to do?

                         JAKE
               We pay an understudy, let's use the
               understudy.

                         RIGGAN
               No.

                         JAKE
               No? Riggan, listen to me. Our dream actor
               is not going to knock on that door and
               say: "Hey fellas, when do we start?"

B5                                                                  B5

     There is a knock at the door. Leslie peeks in.

                         LESLIE
               Can I talk to you for a second?

                         RIGGAN
               Yeah. What's up?

          LESLIE
Did you find another actor?

            RIGGAN
No.

          LESLIE
Okay. Well... Mike's available.

            RIGGAN
He is?
            JAKE
Mike who?

          RIGGAN
I thought he was doing--

          LESLIE
He was. He quit. Or got fired.
            JAKE
Mike who?

          RIGGAN
Which one? Quit or fired?

          LESLIE
With Mike it's usually both.

          JAKE
Mike Fucking Who?

            LESLIE
Shiner.

            JAKE
Yes!

            RIGGAN
Jake...
          JAKE
Yes! How do you know Mike Shiner?

          LESLIE
We share a vagina.

          RIGGAN
You think he'd want to do it?

            LESLIE
Yeah.

                    JAKE
          How do you know?

                    LESLIE
          Because he said he'd want to do it.

                       JAKE
          Yes!

                    RIGGAN
          Jake. Hang on a minute.
                    JAKE
              (to Riggan)
          Ask me if he sells tickets.

                    RIGGAN
          Does he sell tickets?

                    JAKE
          A shitload of tickets. Now ask me if the
          critics like him?

                    RIGGAN
          Do they like him?

                    JAKE
          They want to spooge on him.

                       RIGGAN
                 (Indicating Lesley.)
          Hey.

                       JAKE
          Leslie...

                    LESLIE
          Right on his face.

                    JAKE
          Everything for a reason, right?
                    RIGGAN
          You think he'll be able to come tonight?

                    LESLEY
          I can call him and find out.

Riggan gives Jake a look.

                    JAKE
          I'll call his agent.

Jake charges out of the room. The camera follows him into...
                                                 10/29/14   /   17.

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                         

    ...the hallway and as Jake makes a left turn, Annie enters from
    the right.

                        JAKE
              Annie, turn the work lights on and get me a
              fresh copy of the script. We're gonna have
              a "put in" tonight.

                        ANNIE
              Who?
                        JAKE
              You'll find out...

    Jake disappears down the hall and we follow Annie through the
    theater and onto...

   INT. STAGE - THEATER - EVENING                              
    ...the stage, where she turns some of the stage work lights on.
    We pan along the stage until we find Riggan, wearing the same
    clothes as before, scanning the empty auditorium.

                        MIKE (O.S.)
              Intimidating. Isn't it?

    Riggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly
    dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes.

                        MIKE (CONT'D)
              Do you have any idea who walked these
              boards before you?
                  (Beat.)
              Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando,
              Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... And
              now you. Riggan Thomson.

    Riggan, trying to hide the intimidation.

                        RIGGAN
              Thanks for coming on such short notice,
              Mike. I appreciate it.

                        MIKE
              Hey. This is what we do.
                  (Indicates a script.)
              So, you wrote this adaptation?

                        RIGGAN
              I did.

                    MIKE
          And you're directing the adaptation and
          starring...

                       RIGGAN
          I am.

                       MIKE
          Ambitious.

                       RIGGAN
          Thank you.

A sly smile from Mike. He leaps onto the stage.

                    MIKE
          Why don't we do a bit of it?

                    RIGGAN
          Hey, I wasn't expecting you to--
                    MIKE
          First preview is tomorrow, right?

                    RIGGAN
          Yeah, but you can go on with the script
          until you feel comfortable--

                    MIKE
          Let's just do some of it.

Riggan tries to hide his excitement. He grabs the script from a
nearby table and walks it over to Mike.

                    RIGGAN
          Take a look at page twenty--

                    MIKE
          Yeah. I don't need that.

                       RIGGAN
          What?

                    MIKE
          I don't need the script. Just give me a
          cue.

                    RIGGAN
          What are you talking about?

                    MIKE
          Feed me a line.

                    RIGGAN
          I don't-- What?
                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                10/29/14   /   19.

                    MIKE
          Feed. Me. A line.

Riggan drops the script and begins the scene.

                    RIGGAN
          "I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
          know the man. I've only heard his name
          mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know.
          You'd have to know the particulars. But
          I think what you're saying is that love
          is absolute."

Mike stares at Riggan, hyper-focused.

                    MIKE
              (Ruminating.)
          Am I saying that love is absolute?
              (He transforms.)
          "Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about
          is. The kind of love I'm talking about you--
          "
              (An intense pause.)
          Well, you don't try to kill people.

Riggan is transfixed, and almost immediately intimidated.

                    RIGGAN
          How do you know the lines?

                    MIKE
          I have a thing, a whatever, a gift.
          (A beat.) Come on, I helped Lesley get
          off book. Hey, give me that cue again.

                    RIGGAN
          "I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
          know the man. I've only heard his name
          mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know.

          I think what you're saying is--"
                    MIKE
          Okay, can I-- Do you mind if I--

                    RIGGAN
          No, go ahead.

                    MIKE
          Follow me. He says, "I'm the wrong
          person to ask." What's his intention?
          Is he fed up with the topic?
          Deflecting? Guilt about his wife maybe?
          Then four sentences all say the same
          thing... "I didn't even know the man."

"I've only heard his name mentioned in

all, particulars? What are you, my
grandmother? But the point is, YOU
DON'T KNOW THE GUY, WE FUCKING GET IT.
Make it one line. "I didn't even know
the guy." Right? ...

          RIGGAN
You pretty much know my lines too, huh?
          MIKE
Can we-- Are we doing something here? Come
on let's go. Cut it down, give it to me
again.

Oh, right, sorry, you see? "I'm the wrong
person to ask?" That's another fuck you.
"Don't put me on the spot. Don't make me
self conscious about my marriage when my
wife is sitting right here..." See? Give
it to me. Give me a good fuck you. Come
on...

          RIGGAN
Okay, let me--

          MIKE
Come on. Give it to me right now. Fuck me.
Right now. Right here. Let's do it.

          RIGGAN
Okay, yeah...

          MIKE
DO IT!
          RIGGAN
    (Jumps in w/out thinking.)
"Hey. I'm the wrong person to ask, okay? I
didn't even know the guy. So what's your
point?"

          MIKE
"What's my point?"

          RIGGAN
"What's your point? What are you saying?
Spit it out. You're saying, what? That love
is an absolute?"
                                          (CONTINUED)
                                              10/29/14   /   21.

                    MIKE
              (Exploding.)
          "Yeah! Alright? The kind of love I'm
          talking about is absolute. The kind of love
          I'm talking about you--
              (A painful memory.)
          Well, you don't try to kill people.

Riggan stands silently, his heart pounding.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          So what do you think, boss? Do I have a
          job?

Riggan calls over to the wings.

                    RIGGAN
          What do you think?

Mike turns to see Sam, who has been there for a bit.
                    SAM
          Larry needs to see him for a fitting.

                    MIKE
          I'm gonna take that as a yes.
              (Walking to Sam.)
          And you are...?

                    RIGGAN
          That's my daughter, Sam.

                    MIKE
          Right. Yeah. I can see it around the... (A
          beat) She doesn't look anything like you.
              (To Sam.)
          And your job is...?

                    RIGGAN
          She's my assistant.
                    MIKE
          Your assistant...
              (To Sam.)
          And can you speak?

                    SAM
          Yup. I can even 'sit', 'stay' or 'roll
          over' if you have any treats.

                    RIGGAN
          Welcome aboard, Mike.

                        MIKE
                  (Mock saluting.)
              Thank you, Captain.

    We follow Mike and Sam off as they...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            

    ...advance through the hallways.

                        MIKE
              I'm Mike Shiner, by the way.

                        SAM
              I know who you are.
                  (Reluctantly honest.)
              I saw you in 'Hothouse' at the Geffen. It
              was... great.

                        MIKE
              That ass is great.

    She turns her head toward him with a disgusted expression.

                        SAM
              Dude. Seriously?

    Moving by her, into a dressing room.

                        MIKE
              This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so
              self-conscious.

    She follows him into the room where we see...

   INT. COSTUME DEPARTMENT - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                 

    ...Larry stressing out while he works on a costume. He turns
    to see Mike standing there. Sam stands against the wall,
    focused on her cell phone.

                        LARRY
              Oh, thank the Lord and pass the
              biscuits! I finally have an actor to
              dress. Hello, Mr. Shiner.

                        MIKE
              How're you doing, Larry?

                        LARRY
              Better, now that you're here. Take off your
              clothes.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                10/29/14   /   23.

Mike takes off his shirt and hands it to Sam. She doesn't budge,
and it hits the floor. He begins to unbutton his pants...

                    MIKE
          You gonna stand there?

                    SAM
              (Glancing at her cell.)
          This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so
          self-conscious.
Larry searches for a few costume pieces.

                    LARRY
          Okay. I'm gonna have to start from
          scratch, with less than twenty-four
          hours... Let's see if these--

He turns to see a completely naked Mike.

                    LARRY (CONT'D)
          Holy-- What is happening? Where are
          your underpants?

                    MIKE
          At home, under the bed, I think.

Sam glances at Mike for a second, then returns to her phone.
Larry begins to help Mike into some pants which, given the
situation, is very awkward.

                    LARRY
          Okay. Everything is too small.

                    SAM
          Yeah, you're not kidding.

Lesley enters the room immediately coming face to face with a
naked Mike. She doesn't notice Sam who is partially hidden by a
clothes rack. She just goes about trying a costume shirt.
                    LESLEY
          Oh, that's nice...
              (To Larry.)
          Forgive him, Larry. Mike's like my five
          year old son. Neither one of them has
          clean underwear...

                    LARRY
          Or pubic hair, I imagine.
              (Folding the pants.)
          Okay, well, I can take out the suit but
          we're going to need some new pants and
          shirts.
                    (MORE)

                                             10/29/14   /   24.
                    LARRY (CONT'D)
              (Looking back.)
          And underwear...

Mike just stands there naked, staring at his penis in the
mirror.

                    LESLEY
              (To Larry.)
          This is too small.
              (To Mike.)
          What the hell are you doing?
                    MIKE
          Waiting for Larry to finish.

                    LARRY
          I'm finished.

Larry disappears deeper into the costume room.

                    MIKE
          Okay, well, then I'm just standing here
          with my balls out.

                     LESLEY
          Get dressed. Riggan's daughter is hanging
          around, and I don't need her to walk in
          here and--

                      MIKE
          Leslie...

                    LESLEY
          No, Mike. You haven't seen her. She's
          always hanging around, just-- I don't--
          Watching everyone. It's creepy. It's--

                      MIKE
          Les...

                    LESLEY
          I don't know if the drugs fried her
          brain or what, but I don't need her
          running to her father saying you showed
          her your junk.

                    MIKE
          Okay, then we should probably get her out
          of here.

Lesley's expression goes blank.

                    LESLEY
          Oh, God. Really?

                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                              10/29/14   /   25.

                    MIKE
          Hey, Sammy...

                      SAM
          It's Sam.

                      LESLEY
          Fuck.

Sam steps forward.
                    LESLEY (CONT'D)
              (To Sam.)
          I didn't mean--

                    SAM
              (Totally relaxed.)
          It's cool. He's a handful, huh?

They both look back at Mike.
                      LESLEY
          Almost.

Sam smiles at her and exits. Lesley wheels on Mike.

                    LESLEY (CONT'D)
          Jesus... How is it you always manage to find
          a new way to humiliate me?

                    MIKE
          To be fair, you make it really easy.

                    LESLEY
          What the hell was she doing here?

                    MIKE
          She brought me.

                    LESLEY
          And stayed???
                    MIKE
          I know, right? She's a little--

                    LESLEY
          Look at me, Mike. This is Broadway. I'm
          here. Finally. And I'm begging you, if you
          love me, please, do me a favor... don't
          fuck it up.

                     MIKE
              (Gently.)
          Come here.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

     Lesley moves toward Mike. He cups her face in his hands
     tenderly. They are face to face.

                         MIKE (CONT'D)
               Play with my balls...

     She twists his nipples hard and walks out.

                         MIKE (CONT'D)
               I won't fuck it up... Probably!
     Larry reappears holding some clothes. We follow him out...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            
     ...through the hallway. He walks by Jake and Riggan who are mid
     conversation. We stay with them.



                         RIGGAN (O.S.)
               I don't care, sign it.
                         JAKE (O.S.)
               Listen to me.

                         RIGGAN (O.S.)
               No you listen to me--

                         JAKE (O.S.)
               I can't afford to listen to you...

                         LARRY
               I'm gonna need to go shopping
               again.

                         JAKE
               Fucking sew something, you old
               fuck!

                         RIGGAN
               I don't care. Give him what he
               wants.
                         JAKE
               His agent is asking for almost four
               times what we were paying--

                         RIGGAN
               Then go into the reserve.

                         JAKE
               The reserve is gone. You spent it
               on the fog. And those fake trees...

                    RIGGAN
          It's a dream sequence, it--

                    JAKE
          And three union midgets that dance
          around like--

                    RIGGAN
          You're not supposed to call them
          midgets--
                    JAKE
          The reserve is gone!

                    RIGGAN
          Listen to me, you didn't see what I
          just saw. But you will, at the preview
          tomorrow. Look, get the contract done.
          I'll get the money.

Riggan begins marching toward the stage.
                    JAKE
              (Calling after him.)
          When???

Laura comes down some stairs and chases Riggan.

                    LAURA
              (Incredulous.)
          Hey, is it true? Shiner?

                     RIGGAN
          He's in.

                    LAURA
          Holy shit! When can I meet him?

                    RIGGAN
          He's in a fitting with Larry.
Lesley comes down the hallway.

                    LESLEY
          I'm going to Starbucks. You guys
          want anything?

                    RIGGAN
          I'm fine. How's Mike?

                    LESLEY
          Did you talk to your daughter?

                     RIGGAN
          No.

                He's great.

                    (Uncomfortable.)
                Okay, well I'm gonna-- Thank you.

      She walks away.

                          LAURA
                And that ass. Like two eggs in a hanky!

      Riggan walks, Laura follows him.

                          LAURA
                Okay, I was going to tell you this over
                dinner, but everything-- I have some news
                too.
                          RIGGAN
                Good or bad? Cause right now--

      A technician walks by.

                          LAURA
                    (Whispering.)
                I missed my last two periods.
                    (Beat.)
                I think it's happening this time.

      Riggan stops. Silent. A beat.

                           LAURA (CONT'D)
                Is that good or bad?
                    (He stares at her.)
                Riggan...?

                          RIGGAN
                It's good. It's great.
      She smiles, her eyes filled with emotion. Riggan smiles back,
      and nods absently.

                          LAURA
                Say something else...

                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                                     10/29/14   /   29.

                         RIGGAN
                   (Joking.)
               You're pretty sure it's mine?

                         LAURA
                   (Unamused but plays along)
               Well, let's see. There's you. Jake. That
               masseuse wore a condom so... Yes, it's
               yours... idiot.

     She puts her head on Riggan's chest. We see his mind racing.
     Laura is moved, and confused.

                         LAURA (CONT'D)
               Are you excited?

                         RIGGAN
               Yeah.

                         LAURA
               Me too.
     Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across
     the face. Riggan looks at her, confused.

                         RIGGAN
               What--?

                         LAURA
               You're not funny.

     She kisses him intensely on the lips and briefly places his
     hand on her belly, then moves it up to her breasts. After a
     moment, she backs away.

                         LAURA (CONT'D)
               First preview tomorrow. Here we go!

     Laura turns and walks away. Riggan continues down the
     corridor. He passes by a Security Guard� in front of a small
     TV. The camera becomes Riggan's POV and advances until...

   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - EVENING                             

     ...we go through the stage door. We scan the backstage area to
     see the stagehands ready to do their jobs. We can feel the
     electricity of a first preview.

     On stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible. Annie
     stands at her podium, calling the cues for the show.

                         ANNIE
                   (Into her headset.)
               Cue 34 and 35. Go.
                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                                10/29/14   /   30.

She turns and looks directly into the camera.

                       ANNIE (CONT'D)
          Places.

                       RIGGAN (O.S.)
          Okay.

Riggan walks on screen wearing his costume, carrying a bucket of
ice and a bottle of gin. He goes to the opposite side of the
stage and takes his place in the wings. He peeks out at the
audience who seem to be watching with interest.

Then we pan to the stage to find Mike, Lesley and Laura
performing the scene we saw at the beginning, around the table.
Mike looks comfortable, sipping at his drink. A half empty
bottle of gin on the table.

                    MIKE
          The maniac shot himself right in front of
          us. I rode with him in the ambulance to the
          hospital.

                    LESLEY
          I'll never get that image out of my head.
          Right before he did it, his eyes-- they
          were so sad... lonely.

                    LAURA
          Did you have to treat him?

                    MIKE
          I didn't have to. But I did.
              (Pouring another drink.)
          He was in bad shape. His head swelled
          up to like twice the size of a normal
          head. I'd never seen anything like
          it. And I swear to God, I hope I
          never do again.

Riggan stands near Annie.
                       RIGGAN
          He's good.

                    ANNIE
          He's incredible. I think he's
          drinking real gin.

Riggan looks out at Mike, who is refilling his glass.

                       RIGGAN
          What?


                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                     10/29/14   /   31.

     A stagehand gives Riggan a bottle. Riggan watches and waits
     for his cue.

                         MIKE
               Ask Nick what real love is. He'll
               agree with me. You watch.

                         LESLEY
               Why don't we just head to the
               restaurant?
                         LAURA
               Don't get him started, Mel. You
               haven't seen how he's been lately.
               He's been depressed. I'm worried
               about him. He's been--

     She gently pushes Riggan and we follow him on stage...

   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                              
     ...where Mike goes to refill his glass with the last of the
     real gin. Riggan snatches the bottle out of his hands and
     gulps the rest, straight from the bottle.

                         RIGGAN
               Been what? (Beat.) I'll tell you
               what real love is. This happened a
               few months ago.
                   (Drops bottle on table)
               And it ought to make us ashamed
               when we talk like we know what
               we're talking about when we talk
               about love.

                         LAURA
               Nick, for God's sake. Are you
               getting drunk?

                         RIGGAN
                   (Pointed at Mike.)
               I don't have to be drunk to say
               what I think.

                         MIKE
               Nobody's drunk. We're just having a
               few drinks.

                         LESLEY
               You've had more than a few.

                         RIGGAN
               What are you, counting?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                10/29/14   /   32.

                    LAURA
          Don't you talk to her like that.
          Don't talk like a drunk if you're
          not--

                    RIGGAN
              (Exploding.)
          Shut up. For once in your life.
          Will you do me a favor and shut up
          for a minute?
              (Beat.)
          Like I was saying... There's this
          old couple, had a car wreck out on
          the interstate. Some drunk kid
          plowed his dad's pick up into their
          camper.

We begin to hear the underscoring of violins.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Fucking teenager. By the time I got
          to the hospital, the kid was dead.
          He was off in a corner laid out on
          a gurney. We took the old couple up
          to the O.R.. They were a mess. We
          worked like hell on them for most
          of the night...

Over the speech, Mike reaches for the new bottle that Riggan
placed on stage. He refills his glass.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          When we were done, we wrapped them in full
          body casts. The husband was depressed.
          Even when I told him his wife was gonna
          pull through, he was still depressed. So,
          I got up to his mouth hole and asked him,
          and he told me it was because he couldn't
          see her through the eye holes. Can you
          imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart
          was breaking because he couldn't turn his
          goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.

Riggan is doing a good job. Lesley and Laura are genuinely
moved. Mike notices. He sips his drink.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          I mean... It was killing him. Killing him
          that he--

                    MIKE
          I'm tired of this shit.

They all look at Mike. In silence.

                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                              10/29/14   /   33.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
              (to Riggan)
          What the fuck is this? Water?

He hurls the glass against the wall. Some laughter from the
audience. Riggan stares at him, confused. He presses on.

                    RIGGAN
          It was killing the old bastard...

                    MIKE
          Did you just give me water?

                    RIGGAN
          Come on, Mike.

                    MIKE
          Come on what?

                    RIGGAN
          Take it easy. You're drunk.
                    MIKE
          Of course I'm drunk! I'm supposed to
          be drunk! This is Carver, man! The guy
          lost a piece of liver every time he
          wrote a page! If I'm supposed to drink
          gin then bring me fuckin gin! I mean,
          you fucked the time period! You took
          all the good lines for yourself! At
          least let me--

The audience is now hysterical. Dozens of cell phones
pointing at the stage. Mike walks toward the apron, facing
the audience.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          Oh, okay. Seriously? You people are
          pathetic. Put the cell phones down and
          join the real world! Will somebody
          please just live in the real world?!!
He crosses to the refrigerator.

                    LAURA
          Where's he going?

                    LESLEY
              (Firmly.)
          Mike, cut it out.

Mike rummages through the fridge.



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                         MIKE
               Look at this. It's all fake.
                   (Tossing items out of the
                    fridge.)
               The milk is fake. The butter is fake.

     Riggan storms off the stage.

                         MIKE (CONT'D)
                   (To Riggan.)
               Your performance is fake.
                   (He finds some fried
                    chicken.)
               Hey! There's chicken. Real chicken. The
               only thing real up here is the chicken.
               So I'm gonna stick with the chicken.

     The audience laughs harder.

                         MIKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Hey, this is good bird, man!
     Riggan charges through the chaos backstage running into a
     panicked Annie.

                         RIGGAN
               Get Mike out of here.

                         ANNIE
               How do you want me to do that?

     Riggan keeps walking up to...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          
     ...the hallway. Jake chases him.

                         RIGGAN
               I want him gone.

                         JAKE
               No.

                         RIGGAN
               What?

                         JAKE
               We can't do that.

                         RIGGAN
               What are you-- Of course we can do that.
               It's our show.

                    JAKE
          Riggan, listen to me--

Riggan comes to a halt and faces Jake.

                    RIGGAN
          No. You listen to me. Get him the fuck out
          of my play. Did you see him out there?

                    JAKE
          It was a preview! Nobody gives a shit about
          previews. Nothing matters until that old
          bat from the New York Times is sitting in
          that audience on opening night.

                    RIGGAN
          We're getting rid of him. I'm not going to
          stand up on that stage and--

                    JAKE
          Shut up! Just shut up for once and
          listen to me. As soon as we announced he
          was taking over, the advance doubled. We
          can't afford to lose a preview. We can't
          afford to lose money. We can't afford to
          lose Mike. This is about being
          respected, validated, remember? That's
          what you told me. That's how you got me
          into this shit. Now, you're the
          director. Get him under control.
              (A beat. As a friend.)
          These are not the nineties anymore.

Jake storms away. Riggan heads toward his dressing room. Out
of nowhere, Mike barrels into him, pinning him against a wall.

                     RIGGAN
              (Startled.)
          Holy Fuck!

Mike presses up against Riggan, breathing down his neck. After a
painful silence...

                    MIKE
              (Like he's possessed.)
          You were good...

                    RIGGAN
          Meet me in front of the theater in
          10 minutes.

Mike chuckles and slaps Riggan gently on the face before he
disappears into his dressing room. Riggan begins walking
again. We follow him into...
                                                     10/29/14   /   36.

   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             

     ...his dressing room. He goes into the bathroom and quickly
     washes his face.

                         SYLVIA (O.S.)
               What the hell was going on up there?

     We pan over to see his ex-wife Sylvia (43), standing in one
     corner, staring at Riggan. She is elegant and simply beautiful.

                         RIGGAN
               I didn't know you were here tonight.
                         SYLVIA
               That guy's an asshole, huh?

     Riggan dries his hands with a towel and comes out of the
     bathroom.

                         RIGGAN
               What are you doing here?
                         SYLVIA
               Sam and I are going to grab a bite
               after she's finished with--

                         RIGGAN
               No, I mean here. Now.

                         SYLVIA
               Well. I know how much this means to
               you, so--

                         RIGGAN
               I appreciate that.

     A beat.

                         SYLVIA
               So, how's it going?

                           RIGGAN
               The play?

                         SYLVIA
               No, you and Sam.

                         RIGGAN
               It's good. (A beat.) It's the same.

                         SYLVIA
               Do you talk to her?


                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                             10/29/14    /   37.

                    RIGGAN
          We talk. We-- I don't know, it's been crazy
          around here.

                    SYLVIA
          You understand where her head is at right
          now.

                       RIGGAN
          Of course.
                    SYLVIA
          She's trying to stay away from everything
          and everyone that got her into rehab in the
          first place, but...

                    RIGGAN
          ...I know, Sylvia...

                    SYLVIA
          ...But that's all she had. So she's--
                    RIGGAN
          I really do get it.

                    SYLVIA
          I know you're caught up in all this stuff,
          but--

                       RIGGAN
          Stuff...

                    SYLVIA
          You know what I mean.
              (Beat.)
          Riggan... You don't have to be a great
          father right now, you just have to be one.

                       RIGGAN
          Yeah.
Suddenly, Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.

                     LAURA
              (Noticing Sylvia.)
          Oh, sorry.

She closes the door. Awkward silence.

                    SYLVIA
          So how is that going? Is she and
          Sam--?

                    RIGGAN
          I don't wanna talk about it.
                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                             10/29/14   /    38.

He goes to a small fridge, takes out a beer and closes it.

                    SYLVIA
          You're drinking?

                    RIGGAN
          I'm having a beer.

                    SYLVIA
          Okay...
He sits and sips in silence for a moment. Then he begins to
take out the wig.

                    RIGGAN
          So, what's going on with you?

                    SYLVIA
          Me? Nothing. Everything's the same I guess.
          I'm going back to teaching.
                    RIGGAN
          I'm thinking about refinancing the Malibu
          house.

                    SYLVIA
          Wh-- I'm sorry?

                    RIGGAN
          I'm thinking about--

                    SYLVIA
          No, I heard you. I just need a second to--
          (A beat.) That's gonna be Sam's house. Why
          would you-- (A beat.) What? For this play?

                    RIGGAN
              (Honest and vulnerable.)
          I need the money.

                    SYLVIA
          Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds?

                    RIGGAN
          What do you want me to say? My health
          lasted longer than the money... Go figure
          that out.

Riggan seems pensive and lost.

                    SYLVIA
          Riggan...
              (Beat.)
          What's going on?... Look at me.

                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                               10/29/14   /   39.

Riggan gently looks up to Sylvia.

                    RIGGAN
          I have a chance to do something right. And I
          have to take it. I have to.

                    SYLVIA
          It's funny. I was sitting here waiting
          for you, and all of a sudden I couldn't
          remember why we broke up.
Silence. Then, as if he hasn't heard what she said.

                    RIGGAN
          The last time I flew here from LA, George
          Clooney was sitting two seats in front of
          me. With those cuff links, and that...
          chin. We ended up flying through this
          really bad storm. The plane started to
          rattle and shake, and everyone on board
          was crying... and praying. And I just sat
          there-- Sat there thinking that when Sam
          opened that paper it was going to be
          Clooney's face on the front page. Not
          mine. (A beat.) Did you know that Farrah
          Fawcett died on the same day as Michael
          Jackson?

She smiles sadly. She kisses him on the head and goes to the
door.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Why did we break up?

                    SYLVIA
              (Looks him in the eye.)
          You threw a kitchen knife at me...

Riggan is smacked by that memory. His eyes on the floor.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          ...and one hour later you were
          telling me how much you loved me.
              (Beat.)
          Just because I didn't like that
          ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie
          Hawn didn't mean I did not love you.
          But that's what you always do. You
          confuse love with admiration.

She smiles sadly. He looks at her. As Sylvia opens the door,
she turns back to Riggan...



                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                    10/29/14   /   40.

                         SYLVIA (CONT'D)
               It's your house, so do what you want with
               it. Just make sure you're there for our
               daughter.

                         RIGGAN
               I will.

                         SYLVIA
               You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan.
     She exits. Painful silence... until...

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               We should have done that reality show they
               offered us. "The Thomsons." That would've
               been good. Crazy, druggy, wise ass daughter.
               Milfy wife with the perky tits. People would
               have watched that.

                         RIGGAN
                   (To the poster.)
               Shut up.

     Riggan stands up and grabs his jacket. He opens the door and
     goes out to...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           
     ...the hallway.

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               Where are we goin'?

                         RIGGAN
                   (Almost whispering.)
               Leave me alone.

     Riggan walks between crew members. Annie interrupts him.

                         ANNIE
               The sun bed is here.

                         RIGGAN
               What does that mean?

                         ANNIE
               It means there's a sun bed out there
               being delivered to in here.

                         RIGGAN
               Who ordered a sun bed?


                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                     10/29/14   /   41.

                         ANNIE
               Mike. He says it's for his character.
               Carver's red necks, "people of the
               land". Part of his process and that
               shit.

     Riggan cannot deal with this right now. He continues walking
     until he arrives at a metal door that takes him out to...

   EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS           

     ...an alley way. Riggan walks toward the street. There is a man
     playing drums. Riggan finds Mike leaning against a parked car,
     dazed and looking up at the marquis...

                         RIGGAN
               Let's go. Walk.

     Riggan begins to walk, Mike follows.

                         MIKE
               Where are we going?
                         RIGGAN
               To get you some coffee. Have I done
               anything to disrespect you?

                           MIKE
               Not yet.

                         RIGGAN
               I have a lot riding on this play.
                         MIKE
               Is that right?

                         RIGGAN
               People know who I am, and--

                           MIKE
               Bullshit.

                           RIGGAN
               Mike--

                         MIKE
               Bullshit. People don't know you. They
               know the guy in the bird suit. They
               know the guy who tells those quaint,
               slightly vomitous stories on Letterman.

                         RIGGAN
               Well, I'm sorry for being popular, but
               that--
                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                10/29/14   /   42.

                    MIKE
              (With irony.)
          Popular? POPULAR?... Oh God, popularity is
          just the slutty little cousin of prestige.

                    RIGGAN
          Okay, I don't even know what that--

                    MIKE
          My reputation is riding on this play.
          And that's... That is...
                    RIGGAN
          A lot?

                    MIKE
          A lot. Exactly. Fuck you. Yes. This
          doesn't work out for you, you get to go
          home to your studio pals and jump right
          back into that cultural genocide you
          guys are perpetrating. "There's a
          douchbag born every minute". That was
          P.T. Barnum's premise when he got rich
          inventing the circus. And you and your
          pals know nothing's changed, and
          whatever toxic shit you make people are
          still gonna pay to see it. But, after
          you're gone, I'll still be here. I'll
          still be making my living on the stage.
          Baring my soul. Wrestling with emotions,
          complex emotions.

                     RIGGAN
          Right. Is that what tonight was about then?
          (Mocking him.) Wrestling with "complex
          emotions"?

                    MIKE
          Tonight was about making it alive. About
          making it bleed. This isn't the Warner
          Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and
          this is how we do things.

Mike turns and opens the front door of The Rum House.

                    RIGGAN
          Where are you going?

                    MIKE
          They have coffee in here.

He walks into the restaurant. Riggan backtracks and we follow
him into...
                                                    10/29/14   /   43.

   INT. RUM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                   

     ...The Rum House. Mike stands at the bar, the bartender
     already pouring two whiskeys.

                         MIKE
                   (To bartender.)
               Thanks, Tommy.

     Tommy nods and walks away.

                         RIGGAN
                   (Getting back on point.)
               People were laughing in our faces.

                         MIKE
                   (Handing Riggan a drink.)
               Tonight they were laughing, tomorrow
               they'll be... be.. tweeting about us. Fuck
               `em. Who cares??? These are the people who
               pay half price to watch us rehearse. Stop
               fucking caring!
                         RIGGAN
               We're doing Raymond Carver. This play is a
               drama. This play is--

                         MIKE
               You don't know what this play is. These are
               previews. This is where we find out what
               the play is.

     Mike points to an Older Woman sitting at the bar. She sips a
     martini and scribbles in a notebook with a sour expression.

                         MIKE (CONT'D)
               You see that woman over there? The one that
               looks like she just licked a homeless guy's
               ass? Nothing matters until she writes five
               hundred words about us in the New York Times.

                           RIGGAN
               That's...
                         MIKE
               Tabitha Dickinson. Yes. And, believe it or
               not, the only thing that matters in theater
               is whether she likes us or not. She does,
               we run. She doesn't, we're fucked.

                          RIGGAN
                   (Preoccupied.)
               She does look like she licked a homeless
               guy's ass.

                    MIKE
          Do me a favor, don't get your panties in a
          twist over a preview, alright? And don't tell
          me how to do my job. Cause, this is my town.
          And, to be honest, nobody gives a shit about
          you around here.

                    LADY (O.S.)
          You're Riggan Thompson, right?

Two fat tourists in "Mamma Mia" t-shirts, with a seven year old
kid, approach the table.

                    HUSBAND
              (Timidly.)
          We're sorry to interrupt...

                    LADY
          Would you mind terribly if we got a
          picture?
                    RIGGAN
          Of course. It's no trouble at all.

The Lady shoves her camera into Mike's hands.

                    LADY
              (To Mike.)
          Would you mind?

Mike gets up with a blank expression and takes the camera.
The Lady pushes the kid into the booth next to Riggan.

                    LADY (CONT'D)
              (Ordering Mike.)
          The button right on top there.

                    KID
          Who is this guy?

                    LADY
              (To his son.)
          Come on, Billy. He used to be like Batman.

She yanks the kid closer and they squeeze up against Riggan.
Mike takes the photo and holds the camera to the lady.

                    LADY (CONT'D)
              (To Mike)
          I think you screwed that one up. Take
          another one.

Mike takes another picture.


                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                              10/29/14   /   45.

                    LADY (CONT'D)
              (To Riggan.)
          God bless you, darlin'. You're very sweet.
          And handsome!

She kisses Riggan hard on the mouth. Then gets up, giddy, and
takes her son by the hand. As the couple leaves, husband shoves
a five dollar bill into Mike's hands.

                    HUSBAND
          We really appreciate it.
An agitated Mike takes a sip of whiskey.

                    MIKE
          Are we good here? Cause I'm gonna go.

                    RIGGAN
          See you tomorrow.

Mike places the dollar under one of the shot glasses and begins
to walk away, but then stops and turns curiously.

                    MIKE
          Why Raymond Carver? You never told me.

Riggan looks at Mike for a second, than reaches for his wallet
and produces an old cocktail napkin with some writing on it. He
slides it to Mike.

                    RIGGAN
          A long time ago, I did a play back in
          high school in Michigan. He was in the
          audience. He sent this backstage after.

                    MIKE
          "Thank you for an honest performance. Ray
          Carver." What is this?

Riggan looks vulnerable. He is trying to make Mike understand
the importance of the napkin, to build a bridge between them.
                    RIGGAN
          And that's when I knew I was going to
          be an actor.

Mike can't stop himself from smiling.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Why is that funny?

                    MIKE
          He wrote it on a cocktail napkin.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                          RIGGAN
                So...

      Mike slides the napkin back to Riggan.

                          MIKE
                He was drunk.

A17                                                                 A17

      He walks away and we follow him as he passes by the bar next
      to Tabitha Dickinson, the Critic.

                          TABITHA
                You headed to Hollywood, Mike?

      Mike stops.
                          MIKE
                Hollywood's headed here, Tabby.

                          TABITHA
                    (A devilish smile.)
                Good luck with that.

      Mike looks directly into her eyes.

                          MIKE
                "A man becomes a critic when he can not be an
                artist, in the same way that a man becomes an
                informer when he cannot be a soldier."
                Flaubert, right?

      He flashes his own devilish smile. She stares back. If she
      weren't so much older than him, you'd swear there was sexual
      electricity between them.

                          TABITHA
                He's a Hollywood clown in a Lycra bird
                suit.

                          MIKE
                Yeah. And at 8 o'clock tomorrow, he's gonna
                get on stage and risk everything. What're
                you gonna be doing?

      A standoff.

                          TABITHA
                Don't you ever worry that I'll give you a
                bad review?



                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                   10/29/14   /   47.

                         MIKE
               Oh, I'm sure you will. If I ever give a bad
               performance.
                   (Beat.)
               Ms. Dickinson.

                         TABITHA
               Mr. Shiner.

     Mike smiles and waves over to an obviously nervous Riggan. He
     goes toward the exit, but we stay with Tabitha, scribbling on
     her notebook. Suddenly she raises her eyes and, with a dark
     expression, looks at Riggan who is passing by.

     We follow Riggan toward the exit. Through the window we see him
     leave the restaurant. Then we pan to a wooden wall, and this
     wall takes us to...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - LATER                               

     ...the theater hallway. Riggan walks through the quiet corridor,
     until he arrives at...

   INT. GREEN ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                       
     ...the Green Room. Sam sits listlessly, drawing some lines
     across a roll of toilet paper.

                         RIGGAN
               What're you still doing here?

                         SAM
                   (Continues scribbling.)
               Nothing. I'm-- Nothing. Your costumes are
               hanging in your room.

                          RIGGAN
               Great...

                         SAM
               I got the coconut water you wanted. If you
               want me to get--

                          RIGGAN
               Hey.

                          SAM
               What?

                         RIGGAN
               I'm not sure if I said thank you.

                      SAM
          For what?

                    RIGGAN
          All of it. You've been doing a good job.
          And I've been...

                      SAM
          Yeah.

                    RIGGAN
          So, I just wanted to say that--
              (He stops abruptly.)
          What is that?

                      SAM
          What...?

                    RIGGAN
          That smell.
                      SAM
          I don't--

                    RIGGAN
          Look at me.

                    SAM
          What are you--

                    RIGGAN
          Look at me.

She does. He examines her eyes, then immediately rises, scouring
the room.

                      SAM
          Dad...

                    RIGGAN
              (Continuing to search.)
          You have to be shitting me... Where is it?

                    SAM
          Could we not do this?

Riggan pulls a jar of peanut butter from the trash.

                    RIGGAN
          What is this?

                    SAM
          That is chunky peanut butter that happens,
          by the way, to have Omega--

Riggan pulls a stubbed joint out of the jar.

                    RIGGAN
          This.

                    SAM
          Oh. That's pot.

                    RIGGAN
          Sam.
                    SAM
          Alright, just relax.

                    RIGGAN
          Relax? What the hell are you doing?

                    SAM
          Protecting myself from cataracts?

                    RIGGAN
          You can't do this to me!

                    SAM
          To you?

                    RIGGAN
          SHUT UP! You know what I'm talking about.

                    SAM
          Yeah. You're talking about you. What else
          is new?

                    RIGGAN
          Don't try to--

                    SAM
          What? Make it about me? I wouldn't dream of
          it.

                    RIGGAN
          Listen to me. I'm trying to do something
          that's important...

                    SAM
          This is not important.

                    RIGGAN
          It's important to me! Alright? Maybe not to
          you, or your cynical playmates whose sole
          ambition is to end up going viral and who,
          by the way, will only be remembered as the
          generation that finally stopped talking to
          one another. But to me... To me... This is--
          God. This is my career, this is my chance

                          RIGGAN (CONT'D)
               to do some work that actually means
               something.

                         SAM
               Means something to who? You had a career
               before the third comic book movie, before
               people began to forget who was inside the
               bird costume. You're doing a play based on
               a book that was written 60 years ago, for
               a thousand rich, old white people whose
               only real concern is gonna be where they
               go to have their cake and coffee when it's
               over. Nobody gives a shit but you. And
               let's face it, Dad, it's not for the sake
               of art. It's because you just want to feel
               relevant again. Well, there's a whole
               world out there where people fight to be
               relevant every day. And you act like it
               doesn't even exist! Things are happening
               in a place that you willfully ignore, a
               place that has already forgotten you. I
               mean who are you? You hate bloggers. You
               make fun of twitter. You don't even have a
               Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't
               exist. You're doing this because you're
               scared to death, like the rest of us, that
               you don't matter. And you know what?
               You're right. You don't. It's not
               important. You're not important. Get used
               to it.

     Silence. Riggan seems devastated, and Sam can see that.

                         Sam (CONT'D)
               Dad...

     She looks at him sympathetically, but not knowing what to
     say... exits.

     After a moment Riggan gets up and heads for the trash can. He
     digs out the roach, grabs some matches and lights it. Music
     begins to sound. He inhales deeply and holds the smoke for a
     few seconds and finally exhales. He coughs, tosses away the
     joint and heads out of the kitchen. We follow him...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS                            

     ...as he slowly walks until he disappears into the darkness of
     the corridor. We keep moving forward until we end up...

A21   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATRE - EVENING                          A21

      ...backstage. We are in the middle of the second preview. The
      music continues, it belongs to the play.

      Laura is by herself on stage performing the end of a scene. She
      stands in the middle of a surrealistic forest set, at dusk.
      There is fog, and trees. A strong, artificial wind blows
      through Laura's hair. Desolate music.

                          LAURA
                    (To the audience as soliloquy.)
                In the days before Nick's depression really
                started to eat away at him, he had no idea
                I was pregnant. And I never intended on
                telling him. I guess we make choices in
                life, and we choose to live with them. Or
                not. I didn't want that baby...

      Three dancers on stage pass by in front of Laura. We follow
      the dancers backstage where we find Mike and Lesley wearing
      pajamas.
                          LAURA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                ...Not because I didn't love Nick. And not
                because I didn't love the-- The idea of
                it. But because I just wasn't ready to
                love myself. There's a certain distance to
                it all now. A wistful distance.
                Underscored by a gentle breeze and the
                sound of the birds... laughing at the
                whimsy of it all.

      A stage hand helps Mike and Lesley into a double bed. The
      camera slips under the covers with them and stays there.

                          MIKE
                    (Whispering.)
                Hey, Les...

                          LESLEY
                    (Whispering.)
                What?
                            MIKE
                I'm hard.

                          LESLEY
                No, you're not. It's just that sometimes
                you don't consider other people's feelings.

                          MIKE
                No. I'm hard. Feel.

                         LESLEY
               Oh, you gotta be kidding.

     The stage begins to revolve as we hear...


   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            
     ...music through the transition. It remains dark.

                         MIKE
               Let's really do this. Let's fuck.

                         LESLEY
               Are you crazy? No.

     Mike rolls on top of Lesley.

                         LESLEY (CONT'D)
               Cut it out...

     Mike continues to maneuver himself.

                         LESLEY (CONT'D)
               I'm serious, Mike. Stop!

                         MIKE
               I'm Mel. Not Mike. Mel.
     A knock on a door.

               Terri! I know you're in there!

     The knocking gets louder.

                          RIGGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Terri???

     Mike, lost in his libido, has begun to have sex with Lesley.
     The camera comes out from under the covers and pans to Riggan
     who stumbles into what is now the Motel Room set. He wears a
     mustache and a long wig, that makes him look like a wild man.
     He holds a gun in his right hand. A neon "Motel" sign is
     illuminated. A clever effect of falling rain is visible behind
     the set, accompanied by the appropriate sound effect. Riggan
     is wet because of the "rain".

     Lesley uses Riggan's entrance to escape from Mike.

                    LESLEY
          Ed!

Mike hops out of bed, unaware of the very noticeable erection
protruding underneath his pajama bottoms.

Some laughter from the audience.

                    LESLEY (CONT'D)
          What are you doing here?
Lesley doesn't understand the audience response, until she
notices the erection herself.

                    RIGGAN
              (To Lesley.)
          Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for
          you. I worshipped you...

                    MIKE
          Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--
More laughter. Riggan is disturbed, but he continues...

                    RIGGAN
              (to Mike)
          Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.

He shoves Mike violently to the floor.

                    LESLEY
          Eddie! Please!

Riggan points the gun at Mike's head.

                    RIGGAN
          What's wrong with me? Why do I end up
          having to beg people to love me?

                    LESLEY
          Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.
She begins to cry. Her performance is beautiful.

                    LESLEY (CONT'D)
          Just look at me. I was drowning. I
          was not capable of-- You deserve to
          be loved. You do.

                    RIGGAN
          I just wanted to be what you wanted.
              (Beat.)
          Now I spend every fucking minute praying to
          be someone else. Someone I'm not. Anyone...

                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                  10/29/14   /   54.

                         MIKE
               Put down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love
               you anymore.

     The audience is silent.

                         RIGGAN
                   (A sad smile.)
               You don't, do you?

                         LESLEY
                   (With sympathy.)
               No...

                         RIGGAN
               And you never will...

                            LESLEY
               I'm sorry.

                         RIGGAN
                   (A revelation.)
               I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't
               exist. None of this matters.

     Riggan points the gun at Lesley. Then at Mike. Finally, he puts
     the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger. PUM! And with the
     explosion, a fake blood mechanism splatters brains onto the
     stage. Riggan drops to the floor.

     A blackout. The audience applauds politely. The curtain falls.
     We follow Riggan off stage and into...

   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                       
     ...the wings, where Annie immediately helps him remove the
     bloody and wet wig with the propeller mechanism. Laura waits
     next to them for their bows. Meanwhile, a stage hand crosses
     behind them, and we follow him as he goes on stage to...

   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           

     ...reposition some scenery for the curtain call. The camera
     carries us to the other side of the stage, where Mike and Lesley
     are in a heated exchange...

                         MIKE
               Just, keep your voice down...

                         LESLEY
                   (Furious.)
               You have to be shitting me. You can't get it
               up in six months...

                    LESLEY (CONT'D)
              (She starts hitting him.)
          ...and now you try to fuck me in front of
          eight hundred strangers???

                    MIKE
          What do you want from me? I have to feel it.
          You know that. I told you that from the--

                    LESLEY
          Oh, fuck you...
Music begins and the curtain rises. The audience applauds as
Lesley and Mike stride onto the stage and take their bows,
smiles plastered on their faces.

                    MIKE
          ...I was in the moment...

                    LESLEY
          I told you to stop. You fucking animal.
                    MIKE
          But... You were incredible.

                    LESLEY
          What is wrong with you?

Lesley starts back for the wings, and Mike follows her. In the
background we see Riggan and Laura enter from the other side to
take their bows.

                    MIKE
          Listen I'm sorry, alright, I--

                    LESLEY
          I want your shit out of the apartment.

They go back on stage and join Riggan and Laura for the company
bow.

                     MIKE
          Can we--

                    LESLEY
          No we can't. Maybe up here you're Mr. Truth,
          Mike. But in the real world, where it counts,
          you're a fraud. How's that for truth? You...
          dick.

Lesley storms off, leaving Mike and a confused Riggan on stage.
Laura chases her off and straight into...
                                                    10/29/14   /   56.

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           

     ...the hallway.

                         LAURA
               What's going on?

                         LESLEY
               He's an asshole.

                         LAURA
               What did he do now?
                         LESLEY
               Oh, nothing. He just tried to fuck me in
               front of a full house.

                         LAURA
               Oh, my God...

                         LESLEY
               Right?
                         LAURA
               That's kind of hot.

     She follows Lesley into...

26   INT. LESLEY AND LAURA'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS
                                                               26

     ...the dressing room and closes the door. Lesley proceeds to
     smash everything on her dressing table. Then she looks in the
     mirror holding a hairbrush.

                         LESLEY
               Why don't I have any self-respect?

                         LAURA
               You're an actress, honey.

     Lesley begins to cry. Laura hugs her.
                         LESLEY
               I'm pathetic. You know, I've dreamt of
               being a Broadway actress since I was a
               little kid. And now I'm here. And I'm not a
               Broadway actress. I'm still just a little
               kid. And I keep waiting for someone to tell
               me I made it.

                         LAURA
                   (Hiding how moved she is.)
               Hey. You made it.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                    LESLEY
          I did?

                    LAURA
          Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner, on a fake
          motel bed, in front of--

                    LESLEY
              (A little laugh.)
          Shut. Up.
Riggan steps into the doorway and sees Laura hugging Lesley.

                    RIGGAN
          Is she okay?

                    LAURA
          She's gonna be fine.

Riggan enters gingerly and walks up to Lesley.
                    RIGGAN
          None of this is your fault.
              (Into her eyes.)
          You're beautiful. And talented. And I'm
          lucky to have you. Okay?

                    LESLEY
          Okay.

                    RIGGAN
          Okay.

Riggan leaves the room. Laura leans on the makeup table.

                    LESLEY
          That was very sweet.

                    LAURA
          Yeah.
Laura is suddenly teary.

                    LESLEY
          What's wrong?

A beat.

                    LAURA
              (Smiling.)
          Nothing. Two years, he's never said
          anything like that to me.

                         LESLEY
                   (Into her eyes.)
               Hey. You're smart. And beautiful. And
               talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay?

                         LAURA
               We're gross.

                          LESLEY
               We are.
     Laura smiles and caresses Lesley's hand. They look at each
     other. Then Laura leans forward, close to Lesley's face...

                         LESLEY (CONT'D)
                   (Nervous.)
               What are you doing?

                          LAURA
               Nothing.
     Laura kisses Lesley tenderly on the lips. Lesley seems
     confused. A few seconds of silence. Then...

                         LESLEY
               Do it again.

     Laura kisses her again. A knock at the door. They separate.
     Mike opens the door holding the prop gun.

                         MIKE
                   (To Lesley.)
               Can we talk about this like two--

     Lesley hurls the hair brush at his head.

                         LESLEY
               FUCK YOU!!!

                         MIKE
               Okay, well, you're not ready.
     Mike points the prop gun at her, pretends to fire and...

                         MIKE (CONT'D)
               That was hot.

     He exits the room. We follow him...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          
     ...down the hallway up to Riggan's dressing room. Riggan sits
     at his table, picking the brains out of his hair.

                         MIKE
                   (Holding the gun.)
               Your gun is ridiculous. It looks like a
               plastic toy. And it still has the red plug
               in the barrel.
                   (Shows the plug.)
               You look like a seven year old when
               you're holding it. I'm not threatened
               by it at all.

     He tosses the gun onto Riggan's table.
                         MIKE (CONT'D)
               Have some self respect and get a new one.
                   (Takes a step then turns.)
               That was a fun crowd, huh?

     We follow Mike to...

   INT. STAIRS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          
     ...the stairs. He climbs them as he lights a cigarette. He goes
     through a metal door that takes him out onto...


   EXT. ROOFTOP - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                         

     ...a rooftop. The Marquis' of the other theaters glowing with
     the street lamps, a classic Broadway view.

     Mike is surprised to find Sam sitting on the cornice of the
     building, a good fifty feet above 45th street. He goes next to
     her, looking down at the street.

                         MIKE
               I don't think it's high enough.

     Sam turns to him, uncomfortable by his presence.
                         SAM
               Me neither.

                         MIKE
               So, what are you doing up here?

                         SAM
                   (Hesitant.)
               Adrenaline. Just came out of rehab. Closest
               I get to a drug.

                         MIKE
               You were in rehab?

                    SAM
              (Distant.)
          Yeah.

                      MIKE
          Cool.

                    SAM
          It wasn't all Dr. Drew or anything, but
          that dude from American Pie was there.
                    A VOICE
              (From the street below.)
          Juuump!

                    SAM
              (Calling down.)
          Eat me!

                    A VOICE
          Okay. Jump on my face!
                    SAM
              (To Mike.)
          I love this city.

                      MIKE
          Yeah.

                    SAM
              (Casually.)
          Why do you act like a dick all the time? Do
          you just do it to antagonize people?

                      MIKE
          Maybe...

Sam turns and faces Mike.

                    SAM
          You really don't give a shit if people like
          you or not...

          Not really.

                    SAM
              (More comfortable.)
          God, that's cool.

                      MIKE
          Is it...?

Mike leans on the railing, looking down at the street. For a
moment, he is somewhere else...

                                             10/29/14   /   61.

                      SAM
          Hey.
              (Mike doesn't respond. She pushes
               him.)
          Hey...

                      MIKE
          What?

                    SAM
          Let's play a game.
                      MIKE
          A game?

                      SAM
          Yeah.

                    MIKE
          What are you, eight?
                    SAM
          What are you, seventy-eight? Truth or
          dare...?

                    MIKE
          You gotta be--

                    SAM
          Truth or dare?

He looks at her, intrigued.

                      MIKE
          Truth.

                    SAM
          The first time we met, you made a comment about
          my ass. Why'd you do it?

                    MIKE
          Because you have a great ass, and I noticed
          it. So, I said it.
              (A beat.)
          Truth or dare?

                      SAM
          Dare.

                      MIKE
          Really...

                      SAM
          Uh-huh.

                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                                 10/29/14   /   62.

A moment of tension.

                     MIKE
               (Looking at the street.)
           There's a bald guy about to walk by down
           there. Spit on his head.

                       SAM
           No!

                     MIKE
           You said dare.

                       SAM
           Truth.

                       MIKE
           Too late.

She stares into Mike's eyes, knowing she's being tested. She
leans over the railing and spits down toward the street.
                       SAM
           Happy?

                     MAN (O.C.)
               (From the street)
           Fuck you!

Sam laughs. Mike smiles at her carefree laugh. It could be the
first time we've seen a genuine smile from him.

                     SAM
           Truth or dare?

                       MIKE
           Truth.

                     SAM
           You're boring.
                       MIKE
           Truth.

She stares him down.

                     SAM
               (Nervous, pretending.)
           Do you want to fool around with me?

A pause.

                       MIKE
           No.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
                                                 10/29/14   /   63.

                     SAM
               (Taken aback.)
           Really? Why not?

                     MIKE
           That's a second question.

                     SAM
           It's a second part.

A pause.
                     MIKE
           I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up.

Impressed with his honesty.

                     SAM
           That didn't seem to be a problem for you on
           stage.
                     MIKE
           Nothing's a problem for me on stage.

                     SAM
           I wanna ask another question...

                     MIKE
           You just asked--

                       SAM
           One more.

                       MIKE
           Go 'head.

                     SAM
           If you weren't afraid. What would you want
           to do to me?

He carefully considers it, then moves his face close to hers.
                     MIKE
           I would want to pull the eyes out of your
           head...

                     SAM
           ...That's sweet...

                     MIKE
           ...And stick them in my skull, and then
           look out at this street and see it the way
           I saw it when I was your age.


                                                     (CONTINUED)
                                                    10/29/14   /    64.

      Mike turns and stares out at the street once more. Sam stares
      at the mystery that is Mike.

                          SAM
                G'night, Mike.

      She walks away and into the building, never looking back.

A29                                                                A29

      Mike stares out into the night. We move to his POV. The street.
      Night turns to day. Pedestrians begin to walk below.


B29                                                                B29

      We crawl down the wall until we arrive at Riggan's dressing
      room window. We push in to find...

    INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY                  
      ...Riggan siting with his feet on the window frame, staring at
      a manila envelope in his hands that reads... "R, MALIBU
      REFINANCE DOCS. SIGN AND SEND ASAP. J." Riggan sighs and props
      the letter up against the mirror.

      With a soft knock, Laura enters. She stands in the doorway with
      an odd expression on her face.

                            RIGGAN
                What now?
      Laura lays the Arts section of the New York Times down in front
      of Riggan.

                          LAURA
                Don't kill the messenger.

      Riggan picks up the paper. His expression immediately changes.
      Laura watches him sympathetically.

                          LAURA (CONT'D)
                He's an asshole.

      Now we see the cover of the Arts section. There is a picture
      of Mike lounging on a black sofa, his bare feet on a table as
      he sips a glass of wine. The Title of the article reads...
      "CARVING OUT HIS PLACE IN THEATER HISTORY. Shiner says Raymond
      Carver is the reason he became an actor." Riggan involuntarily
      squeezes the paper as he reads on, filling with rage.

                          BIRDMAN (V.O.)
                He's fooling you.
                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                10/29/14   /   65.

                     RIGGAN
          Shut up.

                    LAURA
              (Confused.)
          I didn't say anything.

                    RIGGAN
          Fuck. This is it?
              (He passes a few pages.)
          This can't be it.
                    LAURA
          Page twelve.

Riggan searches desperately for page twelve. When he gets
there, he finds a huge ad of the new Toyota Camry that almost
fills the entire page, and down in the left corner a tiny
press release with the title:

"From Birdman to Carver: An aging Action Hero Grasps for His
Youth."

                    RIGGAN
              (Reading.)
          "Riggan Thompson, better known as the face of
          the Birdman films, tries not to lay an egg on
          Broadway..."
              (Flipping pages.)
          Where's the rest of it?

                    LAURA
          There is no rest of it.

                    RIGGAN
          They didn't use the photo I sent them.

                    LAURA
          What photo?

                    RIGGAN
          The one you liked. The one you said
          I look like a young Jack Nicholson.

                    LAURA
              (She lights a candle.)
          Don't worry about it. Someone'll be using
          that to pick up dog shit tomorrow.

                    RIGGAN
          How can you be so calm about this?

                    LAURA
          What are my other choices?

                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                   10/29/14   /   66.

                         RIGGAN
               Aren't you scared at all?

                         LAURA
               About what?

                         RIGGAN
               About being humiliated out there.

                         LAURA
               It won't be the first time I've been
               humiliated.

                         RIGGAN
               I bet it won't.

     Laura looks at him with fire in her eyes.

                         LAURA
               You're an asshole.
     She charges to the door and is about to leave when she turns
     back to Riggan...

                         LAURA (CONT'D)
               By the way... I'm not pregnant. So there's
               one thing you don't have to worry about.

     She leaves, slamming the door behind her.

     Riggan remains still. Mike seems to be smirking at him right
     through the cover of the Arts section...

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               That pretentious, little, theater fuck is
               stealing your thunder.

     Riggan charges out of the room and into...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          

     ...the hallway. He walks to Mike's dressing room, finds the
     door half opened and enters...


   INT. MIKE'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             

     ...discovering Mike lying in a sun bed. His arm is sticking
     out of it, holding on to a copy of Borges's 'Labyrinths'.

     Riggan yanks the sun bed open. Mike is asleep, wearing tiny
     sun goggles. Riggan slams the lid down on him.


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                    MIKE
          What the fuck is going on!

                       RIGGAN
          Get up!

                       MIKE
          Back away.

                       RIGGAN
          Get up.
Riggan slaps Mike on the arm.

                    MIKE
          Ow, fuck that hurts!

                    RIGGAN
          So, Carver is the reason you became an
          actor?
                       MIKE
          What?

                    RIGGAN
          This is my play! I did the work. I raised the
          money. I arrange the press.

                    MIKE
          They called me for an interview. I said-- I
          don't know, I said the first thing that
          came to mind. Jesus, we got the cover of
          the Arts section!

                    RIGGAN
          You said the first-- Fuck the Arts section.
          The first thing that came to mind? Right.
          Cause that's you. Mr. Natural. Mr. Fuck the
          scene, just stare at my massive hard-on.
          Because that's the truth of the moment.
                    MIKE
          You think it looked massive?

                    RIGGAN
          Shut up. Shut the fuck up. You don't get
          hard on my stage unless I tell you to.

                    MIKE
          Your stage? This stage belonged to a lot of
          great actor's, pal. But you are not one of
          them.

Mike storms out of the room. Riggan follows him into...
                                                  10/29/14    /   68.

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          

     ...the hallway. He slaps Mike on his sun burned back.

                         RIGGAN
               So, you wrote your own lines?

     He slaps him again.

                         MIKE
               Ow. Fuck. Yes I did.

                         RIGGAN
               You changed a few words, and mumbled a
               little, you self absorbed prick.

                         MIKE
               Look who's talking...

                         RIGGAN
               Let me tell you something, you spiteful
               nobody piece of shit.
                         MIKE
               Nobody? My hard-on has already fifty
               thousand views on youtube.

                         RIGGAN
               Fifty thousand views? A cat playing with
               a dildo has more than that.

                         MIKE
               I don't care.

                         RIGGAN
               Yes you do.
                   (Beat.)
               Everybody says: "Mike is so honest". (Smacks
               him.) "So truthful". (Smacks him again.)

                         MIKE
                   (Like a child.)
               Ouch. Fuuuuuck. Cut the shit!
     Riggan corners Mike against the wall.

                         RIGGAN
               You said in the interview that your father
               was a drunk, like Carver. Is that true
               Mike? Is it really true?

     Riggan stares intensely into Mike's eyes. Mike looks away.



                                                          (CONTINUED)

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Because my father was. My father was a mean
          fucking drunk. Beat the shit out of us. But
          we were okay with the beatings. You know
          why? Because at least when he was beating
          us, he wasn't thinking about taking us out
          to his tool shed...

Mike's expression changes.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          That sonofabitch would smile and say, "Do
          you want to kneel down and unbuckle my
          belt? Or do you want me to take it off and
          use it?" I learned how to make myself numb.
          But my sister-- (Holding back tears.) My
          little sister...

Riggan can't go on. Mike is horrified.

                    MIKE
          Jesus, Riggan. I'm really sorry. I
          didn't-- That's fucking horrible...

                    RIGGAN
              (Crazy smile.)
          Yeah. It's also not true. See? (Cracking
          up.) I can pretend too, you little dick!

Riggan shoves Mike violently.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Don't fuck with me, Mike.

                    MIKE
          You're crazy...

                    RIGGAN
          You have no idea what I'm capable of. You
          understand me?
Riggan pulls the paper out of his back pocket.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Working with Riggan Thomson is like
          waltzing with a monkey?

He smacks Mike in the head with the paper and begins to jump in
front of him, ready to fight.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Let's go. Put your hands up.



                                                     (CONTINUED)
                                                     10/29/14   /   70.

                         MIKE
                   (Tauntingly.)
               Don't you want to go put on your tights and
               your--

     Riggan punches him on the face. Mike needs a few seconds to
     understand what has just happened. Then they begin to wrestle
     in the hallway. Mike breaks free from the headlock.

                         MIKE (CONT'D)
               What are you gonna do? You gonna get rid of
               me? Huh? What do you think my friend
               Tabitha is going to write in the Times
               after you get rid of me?

     Riggan stares at Mike, paralyzed by the truth. Finally, he
     turns and marches to his dressing room, and we follow him...

   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             

     ...Riggan slams the door shut and paces in a rage. He glares at
     a make-up box on the table and, points his finger at it, and
     sends it flying across the room.

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               You are lame, Riggan. Rolling around
               with that third rate actor in an 800
               seat shithole like this.

                         RIGGAN
                   (Whispering.)
               Breathing in, I feel my rage. Breathing
               out, I embrace my mental formations.

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               You're going to let that poncey theater
               fuck threaten you?

     Riggan continues breathing deeply with his eyes tightly closed.
     He smiles a tiny artificial smile.

                         RIGGAN
                   (Whispering.)
               Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out,
               I ignore my mental formations. This is a
               mental formation. This is a mental form--

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               Stop that shit. I am not a mental
               formation. I am "you", asshole.

     Riggan looks down at the poster on the floor.


                                                          (CONTINUED)

                    RIGGAN
              (Whispering.)
          Leave me alone.

                    BIRDMAN (V.O.)
          You were a movie star, remember?
          Pretentious, but happy...

Riggan opens his eyes, slowly. A sad expression on his face.

                    RIGGAN
          I was not happy.

                    BIRDMAN
          ...Ignorant but charming. Now you are a
          tiny bitter cocksucker.

                    RIGGAN
          Shut up! Stop whining! I was miserable!

                     BIRDMAN (V.O.)
          Yeah. But fake miserable. Hollywood
          miserable.

Riggan points his fingers at a lamp and sends it flying.

                    BIRDMAN (V.O.)
          What are you trying to prove? Huh? That
          you're an artist? You're not.

                      RIGGAN
          Fuck you!

Riggan points his fingers at a chair and sends it flying.

                    BIRDMAN (V.O.)
          Fuck you, coward! And fuck those critics
          that made you quit. Our franchise
          grossed billions worldwi--

                    RIGGAN
          And billions of flies eat shit everyday!
          So what? Does that make it good? (Beat.)
          And I don't know if you've noticed, but
          that was 1992! Look at me! (He takes off
          his shirt.) This is what's left!
          (Grabbing his neck.) This! (Grabbing his
          chest.) This! (Totally exploding.) I'm
          fucking disappearing! I'm the answer to a
          fucking trivial pursuit question.

Riggan sits down, exhausted.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                         RIGGAN (CONT'D)
               What part of that don't you get? You're
               fucking dead.

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               We are not dead. We're--

                         RIGGAN
               Stop saying 'we'! There is no 'we'. I am
               not you. I'm Riggan fucking Thomson.
                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               No. You're Birdman. Because without me, all
               that's left is "you". A sad, selfish,
               mediocre actor, grasping--

     Riggan points his finger and sends the poster flying, spearing
     it on a coat rack, piercing Birdman right through the heart.
     Finally, silence. Until...

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               What the hell did you do that for? I liked
               that poster.

     A confused Riggan looks over to the wall, where the lamp on the
     floor is creating a shadow of his figure. Only in the shadow, it
     appears as if Riggan is wearing the Birdman costume. Stunned,
     Riggan slowly lifts one arm and in the shadow we see a wing.

                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
               It's always 'we' brother.

     The television turns on by itself, playing an episode of the
     original Birdman cartoon. Riggan points his fingers at the tv
     and sends it hurling at the shadow. Then he proceeds to
     destroy everything in his room with his telekinetic powers.

     We slowly pan to see that, behind Riggan, Jake stands on the
     other side of the half-opened door. We push in on Jake,
     watching in shock. The camera turns and becomes Jake's POV...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          

     ...and now, from his view, we see Riggan yelling at the shadow.

                         RIGGAN
               Fuck you! Fuck you!

     He picks up a chair and throws it down. He then picks up the
     newspaper from the floor and tossing it all around. And now we
     understand that he is not using telepathy. He has been using
     only his hands. Completely mad. As Riggan turns to pick up
     something else, he spots Jake on the other side of the door. He
     immediately calms himself and walks over.

                       RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          What's up?

                    JAKE
          Um... Well. Two hours to curtain. Why don't
          you rest a little bit?

                    RIGGAN
          Yeah. Sure.

                    JAKE
          Last preview, buddy. We're almost there.

                       RIGGAN
          Okay.

                    JAKE
          How ya doin?

                    RIGGAN
          Good. Great.
                    JAKE
          Good. That's good.
              (A beat.)
          The, uh, money came through. I just have to
          transfer it to the account.

                    RIGGAN
          Oh, that's terrific...

                    JAKE
          Okay. Well, I'm gonna do that.
              (He stares at Riggan who
               seems about to collapse.)
          You know I'm proud of you, right? This took
          balls. And you did it.

Riggan nods. An exhausted sadness in his eyes.

                    RIGGAN
          I can't do this anymore, Jake.

                       JAKE
          What?

                    RIGGAN
          I think I'm gonna cancel the
          preview. I'm exhausted.

                    JAKE
          It's a joke, right? (He forces a
          laugh.) Good one, Riggan.

                                             10/29/14    /   74.

                    RIGGAN
          I'm starting to believe that this is not
          for me. The applause is... lukewarm. I
          think they're laughing at me.

                    JAKE
          What are you--? Listen. There's a three
          block line of people waiting to see you.
          We are sold out. It's a full house.

                       RIGGAN
          Really?

                    JAKE
          Yes. And the French embassador is
          coming. And the prince of Saudi Arabia,
          with one of his wives. And... I wasn't
          going to tell you this, but-- Martin
          Scorsese. He's casting for his new
          film. But don't tell anyone, okay? This
          is between you and me.
                    RIGGAN
          Okay. I'll be ready.

Riggan smiles. He has forgotten about his existential doubts.
A worried Jake closes the door. He walks a few steps and
finds Laura and Lesley. They've been listening to his
conversation with Riggan.

                       LESLEY
          How is he?

                    JAKE
          He'll be okay.

                    LESLEY
          Poor creature.

                    LAURA
          Is it true? Scorsese?
                    JAKE
          Yes. And the new Pope too.
              (Beat.)

They both understand.

                    LAURA
          You're an asshole, Jake.

                    JAKE
          I'm the one keeping this boat afloat.

                    LESLEY
          So there is no line of people out there?

                    JAKE
          I don't know. Now go and get ready.
          That's your job.
              (He begins to walk.)
          I'll better invest in a taco truck, or
          a strip joint near the airport.

Laura leaves. We follow Lesley up to Riggan's dressing room.
She knocks on the door. Nothing. Silence. She half-opens the
door and, from behind her, we see Riggan examining his right
hand. He has blood falling from the palm to the wrist.

                    LESLEY
          Are you okay?

                    RIGGAN
              (Smiles.)
          Yeah, I-- This is nothing. Shaving.
He cleans his hand against his trousers.

                    LESLEY
          I just want to say I'm sorry.

                       RIGGAN
          For what?

                    LESLEY
          I knew what Mike was capable of,
          and I brought him in, anyway.

                    RIGGAN
          You did good.

Lesley nods. A beat.

                    LESLEY
          Tomorrow's my first opening night
          on Broadway.

                       RIGGAN
          Mine too.

                    LESLEY
          And I want you to know that,
          whatever happens, I'll always be
          grateful to you for that.

                    RIGGAN
          Me too. It's going to be great. Full
          house.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     She looks at him with tender eyes. Then we follow her along
     the corridor until she passes by Mike's dressing room. Mike
     half-opens the door and sees Lesley walking by. He has a
     black eye. He waits for Lesley to be completely gone, and
     then he comes out of his dressing room and we follow him up
     the stairs to...

   EXT. ROOFTOP - THEATER - DUSK                                  
     ...the rooftop. He finds Sam standing on the cornice, looking
     at the street.

                         MIKE
               For fuck's sake, just jump already.

     Sam stares out, a smile creeping over her face.
                         SAM
               How did you know I'd be up here?

                         MIKE
               I didn't. I was just hoping.

     Silence. Mike walks up next to her and stares out as well.

                         SAM
               Where's Lesley?

                            MIKE
               Moving on.

                         SAM
               Smart girl...

                         MIKE
               I appreciate that.
     A beat.

                         SAM
               Ready for the last preview?
                   (Noticing his black eye.)
               Who did that to you?

     Mike smiles. No answer.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
               Could have been anybody, I guess.
                   (After a beat.)
               I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley.
     He barely says no, smiling, and lights a cigarette. She
     understands.

                     SAM (CONT'D)
           Oh, don't tell me...

Silence.

                     MIKE
           What's the worst thing he ever did to
           you?

Sam is surprised by the question. She thinks for a moment.
                     SAM
           He was never around, so...

                     MIKE
           That was--?

                      SAM
           No. That was-- Who gives a shit. It
           was the way he tried to make up for
           it by constantly trying to convince
           me I was special. (A beat.) What
           about you?

                     MIKE
           My dad?

                     SAM
           Yeah.

                     MIKE
           He pretended I was his son.

She stares him down. Silence.

                     SAM
           So, what happens now?

                     MIKE
           I have no idea...
                     SAM
           Yeah...

A beat.

                     MIKE
           He was right, though.

                     SAM
           About what?

                     MIKE
           About your being special. You're hanging
           around here trying to make yourself

                         MIKE (CONT'D)
               invisible behind that fragile little fuck
               up routine. But you can't. You're
               anything but invisible. You're big. And
               you're sort of this really great mess, a
               candle burning at both ends, and no
               amount of booze or pills is gonna hide
               that.

     Sam tosses Mike's cigarette over the balcony, and kisses him.
     He leans into the kiss.
                         MAN'S VOICE
                   (From below.)
               Jesus Fuck!

     She suddenly pulls away.

                         SAM
               It's a good thing you're an actor and not a
               writer cause that little speech was just
               like, Oprah... Hallmark... R. Kelly bad.
     She kisses him lightly one more time and then walks away. When
     she gets to the door she stops and leans on the frame.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
               Truth or dare?

                         MIKE
               Truth.

                         SAM
               No.

                         MIKE
               Truth.

                         SAM
               No. Truth or dare?

     The slightest smile as she exits through the door, and after a
     short pause, Mike follows...

   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS                         

     ...along a darkened hallway. They reach a tiny wooden door and
     Sam leads the way through it.

                         MIKE
               Do you have any idea where you're going?

                         SAM
               Absolutely not.

     She continues on until she gets to...


   INT. ABOVE STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                      

     ...the "grid" above stage where the lights are located. We can
     see, below us, the empty seats of the auditorium and the
     kitchen set.

                         MIKE
               What now...?

     Mike reaches up to kiss her. She stops him.

                         SAM
               How do you do it?
                         MIKE
               What?

                         SAM
               How do you go out there and pretend to be
               someone else in front of all those people?

                         MIKE
               I don't pretend. Not out there. Just about
               every place else, but never out there.

                         SAM
               Good to know.

     They stare at one another...

                         MIKE
               What are we doing here?

                         SAM
               What do you mean?

                         MIKE
               I mean, what are we doing here?

     She moves in.

                         SAM
               Adrenaline...
     They kiss. The camera begins to drift down toward the stage...

                         RIGGAN (O.S.)
               Fucking teenager.

     As the camera continues down from the grid, we discover an
     auditorium full of people staring at the actors on stage.

                    RIGGAN (O.S) (CONT'D)
          By the time I got to the hospital, the
          kid was dead. He was off in a corner
          laid out on a gurney. We took the old
          couple up to the O.R.. They were a
          mess. We worked like hell on them for
          most of the night...

We pan along the auditorium back to the stage to find Riggan,
Mike, Lesley and Laura in the kitchen.
                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          When we were done, we wrapped them in
          full body casts. The husband was
          depressed. Even when I told him his
          wife was gonna pull through, he was
          still depressed. So, I got up to his
          mouth hole and asked him, and he told
          me it was because he couldn't see her
          through the eye holes. Can you imagine?
          I'm telling you, the man's heart was
          breaking because he couldn't turn his
          goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.

                    LESLEY
              (In genuine tears.)
          That's terrible. (Beat.) Perfect.
          And terrible.

She is crushed. Laura holds Lesley, trying to control her own
emotion.

                    RIGGAN
              (Taking this in.)
          Yeah. So I guess what we have to
          ask ourselves is... What do we talk
          about when we talk about love?

The lights go to a blackout and the audience applauds as some
scene change music plays. As we follow Riggan off stage, the
lights are turned on again, but now they have an orange mood.
Lesley is the only one on stage, doing a monologue.

                    LESLEY
          Mel and I have been together five
          years, been married for four. But
          it was Ed who taught me something
          no one else could... He taught me
          what it felt like to really feel
          loved. And the terrible thing is
          that if something happened to Mel
          or myself, if something happened to
          either one of us tomorrow, I think
          the other one would grieve for a
          while, you know, but then would go

                     LESLEY (CONT'D)
           out and love again, have someone
           else soon enough. All this-- All of
           this love we're talking about... it
           would just be a memory. Maybe not
           even a memory. Am I wrong? I mean,
           I don't know anything. And I'm the
           first one to admit it.

A Dresser waits in the wings to help Riggan with his change.

                     DRESSER
           That was amazing!

Riggan looks proud. Things are finally going well. He undresses
to his underwear and puts on a robe and his moccasins, as the
stage begins to revolve. Laura, in costume, walks up beside
him. Over the following dialogue, the kitchen gives way to the
extravagant garden set we saw before.

                     LAURA
               (A bit distant.)
           It's actually going well.

                     RIGGAN
           Yeah. (A beat.) Hey. I think we have to
           talk.

                     LAURA
               (Sad smile.)
           No. We don't.

Riggan nods.

                     RIGGAN
           Right. (Beat.) We will eventually,
           though, `cause that's the only way I get
           to say I'm sorry. I really am.

Silence.

                     LAURA
           We could've made good parents.

                     RIGGAN
           Horrible. We would've been just--

                     LAURA
           Awful. Would have raised, like...

                     RIGGAN
           ...a serial killer...

                     LAURA
           ...or Justin Bieber.

                         LAURA (CONT'D)
               I'm not really the housewife type anyway. I
               thought I could be a mom. My body seems to
               disagree.

     The lights come up and Laura walks onto the stage.

                         LAURA (CONT'D)
                   (Back to him.)
               You were right. This was fun.
     Riggan watches her go, but something else grabs his attention.
     We pan across the stage to see Sam and Mike on the other side.
     They talk and laugh. Sam kisses Mike softly. Mike playfully
     grabs her ass.

     We pan back to Riggan. His expression morphs from broken-
     hearted to rage. He marches over to a stage hand.
                         RIGGAN
               You have a cigarette?

     The stage hand holds out a pack, Riggan takes one.

                         STAGE HAND
               You need a light?

     Riggan snatches the lighter and storms out through the hallway,
     and out the back door of the theater to...

   EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS         

     ...the alley. Down at the end, we can see the tourists making
     their way about the streets. Riggan lights the cigarette and
     leans back against the stage door trying to calm himself.

                         RIGGAN
               Breathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out,
               I ease myself.

     But this is New York City. A fluorescent light buzzes above his
     head. Taxis honk their horns. The sound of pedestrians yelling
     at one another. All fueling his agitation.
     Riggan checks his watch. He pulls one last drag from the
     cigarette before he tosses it, and turns to head back in, only
     to realize the door has locked. He tries to pull it open to no
     avail. He begins to knock loudly on the door. There is no
     response. He knocks louder. Nothing.

     He is turning to walk away when he realizes that his robe is
     caught in the door. He checks his watch again and now is
     beginning to panic. He tries to tear at the robe but the terry
     cloth is too strong for him to rip. Frantically, he looks around
     for an answer. No answer. No time. He pulls the robe off of him

     and, wearing only his underwear and moccasins, he charges down
     the alley way toward...

   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                      

     ...the street. Now, rushing down the block in his underwear. A
     tourist spots him.

                         TOURIST
               Hey, aren't you...?

                         RIGGAN
               I'm sorry. I can't really--

                          TOURIST
               Riggan Thompson! Holy Shit! Let me get an
               autograph.

     Riggan marches on as a few more people begin to notice. The
     Tourist runs in front of him, forcing him to stop.

                         TOURIST (CONT'D)
               Come on, man. Don't be a dick. Let me have
               an autograph.

     The man produces a pen and a magazine from his pocket. More
     people begin to gather...

                          MAN ON STREET
               Birdman!

     Seeing no other way out, Riggan signs the autograph.

                         TOURIST
               Dude! You fuckin' rock!

     Directly in front of him stand a lady and her two kids.

                         LADY
               Can we take one picture?

                         RIGGAN
               Are you kidding me?

                         KID #1
               Why is he naked?
                         LADY
               One picture...

                         KID #2
               I can see his weenie.

     Riggan tries to get past them, but a crowd has formed. A swarm
     of cell phones begin to glow like fireflies.

                         LADY
                   (To her kids.)
               Get next to him!

                         RIGGAN
               Give me a fucking break, lady.

     The kids run up next to him. Even more people crowding around.
     Riggan puts up his middle finger, just as the Lady takes the
     shot. He shoves the kids aside and moves on.

                         WOMAN ON STREET
               He looks so old in person.

                         MAN ON STREET
                   (From across the street.)
               You suck!
                           RIGGAN
               Fuck you!

     Riggan pushes through the crowd to get to the lobby. The people
     begin to chant. Dozens of cell phones recording him.

                         CROWD
               Bird-man! Bird-man! Bird-man!

     Riggan pushes his way through to the lobby doors...

   INT. LOBBY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                             

     ...to be stopped by the vision of Ralph in a wheelchair. His
     head wrapped in a bandage. A man in a suit next to him.

                         RIGGAN
               Jesus Christ! What're you doing here?

                         RALPH
               Waiting for Jake. This is Mr. Roth, my

     Riggan continues walking toward the auditorium. Ralph and Mr.
     Roth follow him.

                         MR. ROTH
               We're pursuing financial remuneration for the

                         RALPH
               I'm going to ruin you!

     Riggan storms toward the auditorium, but is stopped by an old
     Usher.

               I'm sorry sir, you're going to have--

   INT. AUDITORIUM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                       

     ...the theater. Riggan stands in the back among the audience.
     He sees the "rain" falling on the stage. The "Motel" sign is
     lit. Mike and Lesley are in bed, for the motel scene, waiting
     for the knock on the door. With nothing else to do, Riggan
     yells his line from the back of the auditorium...

                         RIGGAN
               Knock knock knock! Terri! Terri!

     The audience turns to see Riggan standing in his underwear.
     They begin to murmur and laugh and point at him.
     Riggan marches down the aisle. He looks haggard and covered
     with perspiration.

     Lesley and Mike, confused, come out of bed.

                         LESLEY
               Ed! What are you doing here?

                         RIGGAN
               Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for
               you-- I worshipped you...

                         MIKE
               Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--

                         RIGGAN
               Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.

     Giggles from the audience. Riggan turns threateningly and points
     to an audience member on the aisle who is giggling at him.

                          RIGGAN (CONT'D)
               Shut up!

     The guy stops smiling. The audience goes silent. Riggan arrives
     at the apron of the stage. Annie from the wings slides the gun
     towards him. Riggan grabs it and points it at Mike.

                         LESLEY
               Eddie! Please!

     Riggan climbs onto the stage. Exhausted. He goes to Mike and,
     with a last effort, pushes him lamely.

                         RIGGAN
               What's wrong with me? Why do I end
               up having to beg people to love me?

                         LESLEY
               Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.

     We pan to the wings where Jake is staring in disbelief. His
     cellphone begins to vibrate, and he answers.

                         JAKE
               Yeah. (A beat.) What?... No no no no no no
               no. Wait there. I'm coming out in--

     He walks toward the hallway and we follow him...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            

     ...through the corridor.

                         JAKE
               No. Wait. Wait for me. I'll be there in a
               second. (Beat.) What is that, a threat?
               (Beat.) What wheelchair? (Beat.) Wait.
               Don't hang up. Mr. Roth, we can discuss--
               Hello?... Hello?...

     He goes out one of the exits and we are left with the silence of
     the empty hallway. After a few seconds, the sound of the gunshot
     from the scene echoes through the theater. The audience
     applauds. The camera starts to move forward. A few seconds later
     Riggan takes over the POV with his bloody long wig and the fake
     gun. We follow up to...

   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             

     ...his dressing room. He puts on a robe. He walks to his
     refrigerator without acknowledging Sam who is sitting on the
     couch, scribbling her dashes on the toilet paper once again.
     Riggan takes out a plastic container of bologna and a jar of
     mustard. He sits in front of his dressing table, peels open the
     bologna and opens the jar of mustard. Slice by slice, he dips
     the bologna in the mustard and shoves it into his mouth.

                         SAM
               Dad...?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                             10/29/14     /   87.

                    RIGGAN
              (Looking up.)
          Hey. How ya doin'?

                    SAM
          Are you okay?

                      RIGGAN
          Why?

                    SAM
          I don't know. You seem--

                    RIGGAN
              (Eating.)
          I'm good. This is good.
              (Holding out a piece.)
          You want some?

                      SAM
          I'm good.
                    RIGGAN
          Great. Great.

He continues to eat. She tries to fill the odd silence.

                    SAM
          So. Opening night, tomorrow.

                      RIGGAN
          Yeah.

                    SAM
          That's exciting, huh?

                    RIGGAN
          Yeah. Well... I don't know. The previews
          have been a train wreck. We haven't been
          able to get through a performance
          without a raging fire... or a raging
          hard-on. I'm not really sleeping, you
          know, at all. And I'm pretty much broke.
          Oh, and also, this play feels like a
          miniature, deformed version of myself
          that keeps following me around, hitting
          me in the balls with a tiny hammer.
              (Beat.)
          Sorry, what was your question?

                    SAM
              (Looking through phone.)
          Never mind... Tonight wasn't bad. It was
          weird. But that's sort of cool. People
          seemed to like it.
                                                     (CONTINUED)
                                               10/29/14   /   88.

Silence. Riggan notices the toilet paper.

                    RIGGAN
          What are you doing? Some homework?

                    SAM
          No. I don't-- When I was in rehab, they
          made us do this.

                      RIGGAN
          Really...
                    SAM
          Yeah. These dashes, represent the six
          billion years the planet has existed.
          Each dash represents 100 years.

She unravels the roll and we see that there are thousands of
black marks running along the toilet paper. She takes the last
two panels and tears them off.
                    SAM (CONT'D)
          And this... (Hands them to him.) ...is
          supposed to represent the entire time us
          humans have been here. One hundred and
          fifty thousand years. That's it.
              (Beat.)
          I guess they were trying to remind us
          that that's what all our egos and self-
          obsession are worth.

Riggan stares at the paper, and then at Sam.

                    RIGGAN
              (Casually.)
          I was a shitty father, wasn't I?

                    SAM
          No. You were a-- (She stops herself.)
          You were fine.
He stops chewing and stares out.

                    RIGGAN
          Fine... You're right. I am just
          "fine". Adorably mediocre.

He smiles to her sadly, and then he wipes the mustard from his
face with the piece of toilet paper.

                      SAM
          Dad!

                      RIGGAN
          What?
                                                     (CONTINUED)
                                                10/29/14   /   89.

Sam looks at the ruined toilet paper in his hands.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Oh... Shit. I'm sorry.

                    SAM
              (Smiling.)
          It's okay. You just destroyed the entire
          human race in one blow.

Riggan looks at her with the saddest of expressions.
                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Dad. (She hesitates.) Do you know
          you're becoming a trending topic?

                    RIGGAN
          Really? What does that mean?

Sam searches for something on her iPhone and then hands it to
Riggan. Riggan looks at the phone and sees a hand-held video of
himself in the streets in his underwear.

                    SAM
          350,000 views in less than an hour.
          Believe it or not, this is power.

Riggan looks at more footage, seemingly confused. After a
moment, the phone vibrates and the video is interrupted by a
text message, which reads "Truth or Dare?"

                    RIGGAN
          It's for you.

She grabs the phone and looks at the screen. Then at her
father. Riggan is staring at her. She looks down.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Go ahead...

                    SAM
              (Hesitant.)
          Are you...?

                    RIGGAN
          Go.

A sympathetic smile. An understanding. Sam exits.

Riggan stares into the mirror absently. His eyes locked on
his reflection trying to find himself in the image. Then he
spots a vase with dying roses, the same roses he flung to the
ground previously.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

     He gets up and goes into the bathroom. He pulls off the long
     wig and the mustache. He washes his face. Then he opens a
     small bottle and uses the liquid to scrub his goatee. The
     dark dye begins to run out, leaving only white hair. For the
     first time we see that Riggan has a white beard.

     He puts on new clothes and comes out of the bathroom. He grabs
     a beige raincoat and heads out of the dressing room and
     into...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            

     ...the hallway. As he passes by Mike's door he can hear Sam and
     Mike. They're trying to be as quiet as possible, but we can hear
     them flirting and laughing.

     He pauses for a moment but continues on. After a few seconds,
     his phone vibrates. He looks at it. A text from Jake reads:
     "Have you seen this??? Awesome!!!" He clicks the attachment and
     sees the, now infamous, video of his underwear escapade in the
     street. We zoom in until the image fills the screen, when we
     finally pull away, we discover that...

   INT. RUM HOUSE - LATER                                         
     ...Riggan's video is being played now in a television in the
     bar. We see the MTV logo on the bottom of the screen and a video
     caption that reads: "Birdman goes viral, 930.000 views and
     counting". The camera pans to find Riggan sitting at the bar,
     drunk. He is one of the few customers. He polishes off his
     drink.
                         RIGGAN
               Let me have another one.

                         BARTENDER
               You got it.

     The bartender pours another whiskey for Riggan. A waiter steps
     up to the bar. The bartender points to a martini.

                         BARTENDER (CONT'D)
                   (To the waiter.)
               That's going over to Ms. Dickinson.

     Riggan's head tilts at the mention of the name. He looks over to
     see Tabitha sitting at a table, scratching in her notebook.

                         RIGGAN
                   (Hands the waiter a bill.)
               I got it. She's a friend of mine.


                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                              10/29/14   /   91.

The waiter pockets the money and gives Riggan the drink. He
walks it over to Tabitha and places it down in front of her. Not
looking up, she pulls the drink closer and takes a sip.

Riggan sits down across from her. She looks up and immediately
recognizes him. He takes out the Carver cocktail napkin and
pushes it in front of her. She looks at him, and then down to
the napkin. She reads it in silence.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
              (Re: The napkin.)
          That was twenty years before I put on that
          damned costume.

A pause. Then she pushes the napkin back toward him.

                    TABITHA
          I don't care.

                    RIGGAN
          I'm just saying, when you come tomorrow
          night, I want you--

                    TABITHA
          It doesn't matter.

                    RIGGAN
          What are you--

                    TABITHA
          I'm going to destroy your play.

                    RIGGAN
          You haven't even seen it. I don't-- Did I
          do something to offend you?

                    TABITHA
          As a matter of fact you did. You took up
          space in a theater which otherwise might
          have been used on something worthwhile.
                    RIGGAN
          But you don't even know if it's--

                    TABITHA
          That's true. I haven't read a word of it,
          or even seen a preview, but after the
          opening tomorrow I'm going to turn in the
          worst review anybody has ever read. And I'm
          going to close your play. Would you like to
          know why? Because I hate you. And everyone
          you represent. Entitled. Spoiled. Selfish.

          you don't get to come in here and pretend
          you can write, direct and act in your own
          propaganda piece without going through me
          first. So, break a leg.

Tabitha goes back to her writing. Riggan sits for a moment.

                    RIGGAN
          What has to happen in someone's life,
          for them to end up becoming a critic?

She looks up at him.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Whatcha writin'? You reviewin' a play? Was
          it good? Bad? Did you even see it? Lemme
          read.

He snatches the notebook from her.
                    TABITHA
          I will call the police.

                    RIGGAN
          No you won't. Let's read your review!
              (He scans the notebook.)
          "Callow". A label. "Lackluster". Label.
          "Marginalia". Sounds like you need
          penicillin to clear that up. None the
          less... label.
              (Looks to Tabitha.)
          All labels. You're a lazy fucker
          aren't you?
              (Looks one last time at
               the notebook.)
          Epistemological vertigo?

Tabitha wants to reach for the notebook, but her pride won't
let her. Riggan takes a flower from a vase at the center of the
table.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          You know what this is? You don't, do
          you? You can't even see it if you don't
          label it. You mistake those sounds in
          your head for true knowledge.

                    TABITHA
          Are you finished?

                    RIGGAN

               the notebook.)

          your... (Showing her the wrinkled
          page.) ...wrinkly, tight ass.

Riggan wears a proud smile. And suddenly, Tabitha begins to
smile with him.

                    TABITHA
          You think you're an actor?

          Eddie!
Eddie the waiter approaches the table.

                    WAITER
          Yeah, Mrs. Dickinson?

                    TABITHA
          Give us some Shakespeare.

                    WAITER
          No problem. Got anything in mind?

Tabitha looks over at Riggan picking the perfect verse.

                    TABITHA
          The Scottish Play. Act five...

                    WAITER
          Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
          Creeps in this petty pace from day to
          day, To the last syllable of recorded
          time; And all our yesterdays have lighted
          fools. The way to dusty death...

He is brilliant. The monologue is perfectly played and powerful.
Riggan being mercilessly reminded of his mediocrity... by Eddie
the waiter.

                    WAITER (CONT'D)
          ...Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a
          walking shadow, a poor player, That
          struts and frets his hour upon the
          stage, And then is heard no more. It is

                          WAITER (CONT'D)
                a tale told by an idiot, full of sound
                and fury... Signifying nothing.

      A few drunks clap at the beautiful performance. Then, a powerful
      silence rings out for a moment, until...

                          TABITHA
                Thank you, Eddie.

                          WAITER
                You got it.
                          TABITHA
                    (To Riggan. A derisive laugh.)
                You're no actor. You're a celebrity.
                Let's be clear on that.

      Tabitha rises from her seat and grabs her things.

                          TABITHA (CONT'D)
                I'm going to kill your play.
      She walks away. Riggan sits numb. After a moment, he reaches
      over and gulps down Tabitha's entire martini, gin pouring out
      the sides of his mouth. Unaware, he slams the empty martini
      glass on top of the Carver napkin and gets up. We follow him
      out onto...

    EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                    

      ...the street, where he walks through the theater district.
      Tired. Drunk. Empty. Neon lights all around him. A crazy, old
      homeless man passes by in the opposite direction shouting
      furiously. Riggan keeps walking until he arrives at a bench,
      with a tree behind. Everything is quiet. Riggan sits on the
      bench, lost. We begin to tilt up, slowly, toward a tall tree.
      We move closer into the branches and the green leaves.
      Silence.

A49                                                               A49
      Night turns into day. The sounds of the city disappear and
      birds begin to sing. The branches now caressed by golden shafts
      of morning sun. Finally, we tilt down slowly and find...


    EXT. STREET - DAY.                                          

      ...Riggan still sleeping on the bench. He looks like a bum. His
      raincoat is dirty and wet.



                                                          (CONTINUED)

                          BIRDMAN (V.O.)
                God. You look like shit, brother. You
                get that mongoloid look when you're hung
                over, don't you?

      Riggan opens an eye. He scratches his hair.

                          BIRDMAN (V.O.)
                Let's go. Get up. It's a beautiful day.

      Riggan sits up slowly. He is really hung over.
                          BIRDMAN (V.O.)
                Stand up! Forget about the times. Everyone
                else has. So you're not a great actor...
                Who cares?!! You're much more than that.
                Fuck! You tower over all these theater
                douchebags. You're a movie star! A Global
                force! Don't you get it?

      Riggan stands up and begins to stumble forward. We pan around
      to find Birdman (a stronger Riggan wearing a cool Birdman
      outfit), following behind him.

                          BIRDMAN
                You spent your whole life building a
                reputation and a bank account, and now
                they're both blown. So what? Fuck it. We
                make a come back. Something huge. Take what
                belongs to us. Take back the spotlight.
                Magazine covers and billboards. Happy meals
                with Birdman dolls. Remember that? That's
                who you are. That's who we are!

      Riggan just marches on. People and cars pass by, but nobody
      notices Birdman. Riggan tries to ignore him.

                          BIRDMAN (CONT'D)
                C'mon, buddy. Tell me we're going back
                to the big leagues. Let's do this.
                Shave off that pathetic goatee, and put
                the mask back on! Batman my balls.
                We'll start a new franchise. Birdman:
                Phoenix Rising. Trust me! A billion
                world wide. Swear to God.

A50                                                                 A50

      Riggan keeps walking. Birdman, insistent, chases, until
      suddenly he begins to flutter off the ground.

                          BIRDMAN
                Do you hear me? You can do anything! You're
                an icon!

      Desperate, Birdman flies a bit higher around him.

                          BIRDMAN (CONT'D)
                You're bigger than life. You save people
                from their boring, miserable lives...

      The camera pans to the street in front of them. People carry
      out their everyday routines. There is a deli, a souvenir shop,
      a small bank...

                          BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                ...You make them jump, laugh, cry,
                shit their pants... All you have to do
                is snap your fingers and...

B50                                                                 B50
      Riggan snaps his fingers, once, twice, and the bank suddenly
      explodes. The sound is so loud that it seems to belong to
      another movie. The earth shakes. People run. Dust all over.
      Fire. An unsteady camera pans back to Birdman.

                          BIRDMAN
                    (Excited.)
                That's what I'm talking about! That is
                cool! Explosive! Big, fast, loud!
                    (He turns directly to the camera
                     and talks about the audience.)
                Look at them. They love that shit!
                They starve for blood and action,
                not this artsy-fartsy-philosophical
                bullshit!

C50                                                                 C50
      We hear a loud roar, and the camera pans to discover a huge
      alien about to crash a cab against the asphalt. Birdman uses his
      powerful blow to send the alien flying away.

                          BIRDMAN
                And when you shout "whooaa!"...
                    (Riggan shouts "Whooaa!")
                ...it explodes in the eardrum of
                millions. Your power is unlimited.

      Riggan slows down his pace, as he starts to listen.

                          BIRDMAN (CONT'D)
                You glimmered on 3000 screens, over 5
                continents, in 47 countries at the
                same time. You are ubiquitous. You're
                a God! You can do it again. You can
                soar above all of them.
                                                   10/29/14   /    97.

D50                                                               D50

      Riggan suddenly begins to levitate.

                          BIRDMAN
                There you go, you mother fucker! See?
                Gravity doesn't even apply to you.

      The camera flies up with Riggan as he floats above the street.
      There is something magical in his ascension, gently impelled by
      the breeze. A beautiful backlight makes his body glow. Birdman
      flutters around him.
                          BIRDMAN (CONT'D)
                Listen to me. We gotta go back! We have to
                do this. We have to end it on our terms.
                With a grand gesture.

      A strange light suddenly palpitates in Riggan's eyes. Something
      makes sense in what Birdman is telling him.

      The camera becomes Riggan's POV. He looks down to see the
      people on the street, watching him in awe.
                          BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                We'll go back. We'll show them how much
                they're going to miss us. Flames. Icarus.
                Sacrifice...

      We tilt up again to Riggan's face. He has a plan.

                          BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                Let's go back one more time and show them
                what we're capable of. You can do it.
                You're Birdman. Do you hear me? You're...

                           A GUY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                Birdman!

E50                                                               E50

      And as the camera pulls away, we discover Birdman is gone and
      Riggan is standing on the ledge of a tall building. The camera
      tilts down and we see that more people have gathered around,
      and more cars has stopped, and they all point at Riggan,
      worried about the situation.

      A guy wearing shorts, a Bob Marley t-shirt and a robe opens his
      window, one floor below Riggan, and looks up at him.

                          GUY
                Dude, what are you doing?

      Riggan looks down at the people on the street far below.
                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                               10/29/14   /   98.

                    GUY (CONT'D)
          You okay, buddy? Do you want me to
          call someone?

We pan to a lady on her balcony filming Riggan with her phone.

                    LADY
          Is this for real, or you're shooting a
          film?

                    RIGGAN
          A film.

The lady looks around but sees nothing.

                    LADY
          Oh, you people are full of shit.

She goes into her apartment.

                    GUY
          I'm calling 911.

The guy goes inside his apartment.

                    RIGGAN
          One more time...

Now, from the door of the rooftop, a good neighbor calmly
approaches Riggan.

                    GOOD NEIGHBOR
          Hi, sir. Can I help you? You should be
          careful.

                    RIGGAN
          Sorry. Can't talk. I'm late.
              (Murmuring.)
          Music.

Some underscoring music begins to sound. The neighbor is now
close to him and helps Riggan step down from the edge on to the
floor of the rooftop.

                    GOOD NEIGHBOR
          Are you alright? Do you want me to
          call someone? Do you know where to go?

Riggan closes his eyes for a moment as the camera moves slowly
toward him. He opens his eyes. The music begins to swell. Riggan
stands up straight and proud, and in a voice that sounds like
Birdman...

                    RIGGAN
          Yes. I know where to go.
                                                   (CONTINUED)
                                                     10/29/14   /    99.

      He turns and begins to run on the rooftop. The music is rousing.
      As he runs, he holds out his arms, spreading them wide. The
      camera runs behind him, until suddenly...


F50                                                                 F50
      Riggan jumps, and the camera jumps after him. He rapidly
      falls toward the street, toward the asphalt. But in his face
      there is no fear. No. He spreads his arms again and...


G50                                                                 G50

      He takes flight, soaring high over Manhattan. The music becomes
      epic. There is something beautiful about this broken man flying
      like a superhero. We fly next to him, and we can see below the
      spectacular sight that is Manhattan, until...

    EXT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS                                     
      ...he finally lands on 45th street and calmly approaches the
      theater. An Usher acknowledges him with a look of surprise.

                          USHER
                Mr. Thomson. I think you forgot to--

                          RIGGAN
                Stop the music.

      The music stops.
                          USHER
                I beg your pardon?

      Riggan enters the theater.

      The confused Usher watches him go by, as he points to the
      street. We pan to see a taxi driver coming out of his car,
      running like a mad man toward us.

      We stay with the Usher and the taxi driver as they argue. They
      take it inside the lobby, but we remain out front.

A51                                                                 A51

      Day turns to night, igniting the lights   of the marquee, which
      reflect off of the lobby doors. We hear   wild applause coming
      from inside the theater. Seconds later,   the doors of the
      theater open and the audience files out   for intermission.

                                MAN
                          (Tweeting on his phone.)
                      It's really good.

                                WOMAN
                      I know. I can't believe it...

          We begin to move up, outside the theater. We see the marquee of
          the play that reads, "What We Talk When We Talk About Love".
          Above the title, in smaller print, "Riggan Thomson and Mike
          Shiner". Below on a banner, "Opening Night".
          We keep climbing until we arrive at Riggan's dressing room
          window. We push in to find...

        INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - EVENING                
          ... that the room is full of roses and cards. Riggan lies on
          the sofa, hugging a cushion. He is wearing the long wig and
          mustache for the motel scene.

          Sylvia appears in the doorway.

                                SYLVIA
                      Wow, that is just NASCAR hot.

          He smiles at her.
                                SYLVIA (CONT'D)
                      I just wanted to come say hello. It's going
                      great out there. You're so good. I mean it.
                      You're-- I really mean it.

                                RIGGAN
                      Come here. Sit next to me.

                      This is your five minutes.
                                SYLVIA
                      Do you need to--?

                                RIGGAN
                      I'm fine. Sit.

          She does.

                                SYLVIA
                      Look at all these roses.

             SYLVIA (CONT'D)                          RIGGAN
     You hate roses...                    I hate roses...

          She laughs. He watches her, something odd in his expression.
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Are you okay? You seem-- I don't know, you
          seem abnormally calm.

                     RIGGAN
          I am calm. I'm great. I spent most of
          the day observing how beautifully this
          pile of dirty clothes was lit by the
          warm afternoon sun. (A tiny smile.) So
          beautiful.
Sylvia, teasing him, closes her eyes and imitates Riggan's
meditation posture.

                    SYLVIA
              (Mocking him.)
          Oh yes. God is those purplish light
          dots I see between my eyes and my
          eyelids.

                     RIGGAN
          You know? I have this voice that talks to
          me and tells me the truth. It's comforting,
          and scary.

A beat.

                    SYLVIA
          I'm going to pretend I didn't hear you say
          that.

                    RIGGAN
          Okay.

                    SYLVIA
              (Changing the subject.)
          You wouldn't believe the crowd outside.
          They said, some people paid up to 500
          dollars a ticket.

He sits down.
                    RIGGAN
          You wanna hear something funny?

                    SYLVIA
          Sure.

                    RIGGAN
          Do you remember our last anniversary party?

                    SYLVIA
          Seriously? You're going to ruin a nice
          moment with that?

                    RIGGAN
          Do you remember the party?

                    SYLVIA
          The party where you fucked Janet Rossbach
          in our bed? Yeah, it rings a bell.

                    RIGGAN
          Yeah, well. Let's skip over that part
          for a minute.
                      SYLVIA
          Gladly.

                    RIGGAN
          After you threw the guests out of the
          house, and the furniture out of the
          window. You locked yourself in the
          bathroom.

                    SYLVIA
          I remember. Why are we--

                    RIGGAN
          I drove down to Malibu. I sat on the beach
          for a while. Just... staring out at the
          ocean.

                      SYLVIA
          Riggan...

                    RIGGAN
          Until I walked straight into the water
          and tried to drown myself.

Silence. Sylvia stares at Riggan, surprised.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          I was in up to my chest when I felt the
          first one. On my back, like somebody was
          holding a frying pan against me. And then
          my chest, and my legs. The water was full
          of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the
          water, and I started rolling around the
          sand like a maniac... crying.

Sylvia doesn't know how to react.

                    SYLVIA
          You said it was a sunburn.

                    RIGGAN
              (Smiling.)
          And you believed me.

                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                            10/29/14   /   103.

                    SYLVIA
          To be honest, I didn't give a shit.

                    RIGGAN
          I love you. And I love Sam.

                      SYLVIA
          I know.

Silence. They stare at each other.
                    RIGGAN
          I never should have video taped Sam's
          birth. First of all because you and Sam
          both look like shit in that video. But
          mostly because I missed the moment. I
          should have just been there with the two
          of you. Present in my own life. So I'd
          have it. But, I don't. I don't have any of
          it.
                    SYLVIA
          You have Sam.

                    RIGGAN
          No, I don't.

                    SYLVIA
          Listen, she's just--

                    RIGGAN
          No, I understand. She needed a father
          and she got one shamefully successful
          youtube video. Pretty pathetic.

                    SYLVIA
              (Putting a finger on
               Riggan's lips.)
          Shhh... There are more pathetic things
          than that. That mustache, for example.
She kisses him.

                    ANNIE ON SPEAKERS
          Places for act two. Places.

                      SYLVIA
          Riggan...

                    RIGGAN
          You should get back to your seat. You
          don't want to miss what's next.

Sylvia lingers for a moment, and not knowing what to say, she
exits. Riggan opens a drawer and takes out a black case. He
                                                   (CONTINUED)
                                                 10/29/14   /   104.

     gently opens the lid. Inside a revolver. He takes some bullets
     out of a box and one by one loads them into the chamber as he
     does his vocal exercises into the mirror.

                         RIGGAN (CONT'D)
               Twenty little leopards laughed at two
               lofty lions. Twenty little leopards
               laughed at two lofty lions. Twenty
               little leopards... laughed.

     He stares at the dressing room door, and with his telekinetic
     powers he opens it. He snaps the cylinder into the gun and
     exits out into...

   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                        

     ...the hallway. He paces deliberately, gun in hand.

     A technician goes by in the opposite direction.

                         TECHNICIAN
               Break a leg, Mr. Thomson.

     Riggan ignores him and continues through to the...

   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                      

     ...backstage area. Annie immediately hustles over to him holding
     up the brain mechanism. He walks right by her.

                         RIGGAN
                   (Brushing her off.)
               I don't need it.

     Annie doesn't seem to understand. She stays there, holding the
     device. Riggan takes his place outside the motel door. We pan
     toward the audience. The auditorium is full. The audience in
     complete silence.


     Riggan knocks firmly on the door. Silence again. Then...

                         RIGGAN (CONT'D)
               Terri! Terri!
                   (Beat.)
               I know you're in there!
     He barges through the door and onto...

   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            

     ...the stage. The motel room as we saw it before. Mike and
     Lesley jump out of the bed.

                         LESLEY
               Ed! What are you doing here?

                         RIGGAN
                   (Almost whispering.)
               Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for
               you-- I worshipped you...
                         MIKE
               Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--

     Riggan raises one hand to silence Mike. Mike looks at him,
     confused. His eyes narrow on the gun. There is no red plug.

     Dead silence. An eerie electricity in the theater.

                         RIGGAN
               What's wrong with me? Why do I end
               up having to beg people to love me?

                         LESLEY
               Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.

     She begins to cry.

                         LESLEY (CONT'D)
               Just look at me. I was drowning. I
               was not capable of-- You deserve to
               be loved. You do.

                         RIGGAN
               I just wanted to be what you wanted.
                   (Beat.)
               Now I spend every fucking minute
               praying to be someone else. Someone
               I'm not. Anyone...

                         MIKE
               Put down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love
               you anymore.

                         RIGGAN
                   (To Lesley.)
               You don't, do you?

                         LESLEY
                   (With sympathy.)
               No...


                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                            10/29/14     /   106.

                    RIGGAN
          And you never will...

                       LESLEY
          I'm sorry.

For the first time, Riggan turns to face the audience. He
smiles the most beautiful insane smile.

                    RIGGAN
          I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't
          exist. None of this matters.

Then he raises a trembling arm, and with his eyes full of
tears, he aims the gun at Mike.

                       RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Pum.

But he doesn't shoot. Then he turns and aims at Tabitha
Dickinson who is sitting on the second row.
                       RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          Pum.

Again, no shot. Slowly, Riggan raises the gun toward his own
head, suddenly a frightening explosion. Blood sprays. Riggan
falls. We stay with the shell-shocked audience. A moment of
tension, of uncertainty, until...

                       MAN
          Bravo!

The audience, one by one, jump to their feet, applauding
wildly. The sole exception is Tabitha, who remains seated, a
dazed expression on her face. We stay with the audience a few
seconds longer.

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

The sounds slowly vanish. After a moment of silence...
                    BIRDMAN (V.O.)
          You won't be hearing from him
          anymore.

                       MAN (V.O.)
          Is he...?

                       BIRDMAN (V.O)
          He's gone.
                                               10/29/14   /   107.

INT. WAITING ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAWN

One of the old Birdman films is playing on a small television
screen that hangs on a corner. The scene ends and a Morning
Show host appears. Behind him a picture of Riggan and a
caption that reads: "Nation in shock." A shot of a candle
vigil in Central park.

                    HOST
          What do we talk about when we talk
          about Riggan Thomson? When we come
          back, more on the actor who two
          nights ago shot himself during the
          opening performance of his new
          Broadway play...

We pan away from the TV to see that the waiting room is
filled with newsmen waiting for something to happen. There is
almost no room to breath.

We pan to see Jake emerging from an elevator, carrying a
newspaper under his arm. He walks through the dense mass of
newsmen with a serious expression on his face. We follow him
into...


INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

...a room. Jake peers in. Riggan lies on a bed, the bandages
on his nose cover most of his face. Sylvia is looking out the
window.

                      JAKE
          Is he...?

                    SYLVIA
          He's awake.

Jake enters the room.

                    JAKE
              (Serious.)
          I thought I lost you, buddy. Thank
          god you're a horrible shot! What
          the hell happened? I was watching
          you up on that stage, and all of a
          sudden you get that goofy look in
          your eye, and you were just like--

He starts to laugh.

                    SYLVIA
          What the hell are you laughing
          about? He tried to-- What is wrong
          with you?

                    JAKE
          I'm happy, okay? He's alive. My
          best friend is alive. And he is the
          man of the hour!

Jake holds the New York Times up in the air.

                    RIGGAN
          What is that?

                    JAKE
          You did it.

                    SYLVIA
              (Coming to them.)
          You have to be shitting me... She
          wrote a review?

Jake unfolds the newspaper and we see the headline of the
review: "The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance".
                    JAKE
              (To Sylvia.)
          Read it.

He hands her the newspaper. She begins to read to herself.

                    SYLVIA
          I don't believe this...

                    JAKE

          birth to a new form that can only

          audience alike. Red blood. The

              (Beat. To a smiling Jake.)
          You're happy about this?

She hands it to Riggan.

                    JAKE
          Happy? I'm fucking euphoric. This
          is the-- This is the kind of review

          He tried to-- He shot the nose off
          his face!

                    JAKE
          He's got a new nose! And if he
          doesn't like that one, we'll get
          him another one. We can use Meg
          Ryan's guy. Who gives a shit? Turn
          on the tv. There are people praying
          for him all over the country.
          They're lighting candles in Central
          Park. He did it. (To Riggan) You
          did it! The play's gonna run
          forever. It's gonna open in London,
          in Paris... The studios will call
          us again. We'll get book offers.

                    SYLVIA
          How do you know all that? You can
          see the future?
                       JAKE
                 (Euphoric.)
          Yes.

She slaps him in the face.

                    SYLVIA
          Did you see that coming? You're so
          full of shit, Jake.

Jake needs a few seconds to recover. Then he looks at Riggan
who just sits there, in silence.

                    JAKE
          Why aren't you saying anything?
          This is what you wanted wasn't it?
              (Riggan gazes at the
               review.)
          Riggan, this is what you wanted.
                    RIGGAN
          It's what I wanted.

                    JAKE
          Okay, listen. You're gonna get hit
          with a "brandishing a weapon"
          charge. If anybody talks to you, it
          was an accident and we're doing an
          internal invest--

A newsman comes into the room and takes a quick picture.


                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                              10/29/14   /   110.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
              (Chasing him out.)
          This is a hospital you motherfucker!

Jake rushes to the door, shoving the newsman and a few other
paparazzi out the door. Security guards. Chaos. Finally
silence. Sylvia steps up and looks Riggan in the eye.

                    SYLVIA
          Is that what it was? An accident?
Riggan just stares at her. His calm, sad eyes peeking through
the bandages. After a moment his gaze moves over her
shoulder. Sylvia turns and we discover Sam standing in the
doorway holding a bouquet of flowers. A bit of awkward
silence, and Sylvia decides to leave them alone.

She kisses Sam on the head and exits. Sam walks the flowers
to Riggan at the bed. She lays them on his chest.

                    SAM
          Alchemillas.

The hint of a smile on Riggan's face.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Are you actually smiling?
              (She smiles.)
          What's so funny?

                    RIGGAN
          I can't smell them.

A moment until the smiles turn to gentle laughter. She takes
out her cell phone and snaps a picture of him.

                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                    SAM
          I'm posting this picture on your
          Twitter page.

                    RIGGAN
          Very funny...

                    SAM
          Set it up today.

                    RIGGAN
          You're joking.

                     SAM
          I'm not.

                                                   (CONTINUED)
                                               10/29/14   /   111.

                    RIGGAN
          Let me see the picture.

                    SAM
          Absolutely not. You look hideous.

                    RIGGAN
          Thanks a lot.

                    SAM
          I'm just kidding. No, I'm not. You
          look hideous.
              (Working on phone.)
          You already have 80 thousand
          followers. In less than a day. And
          I'm about to scare the shit out of
          them.

                    RIGGAN
          Let me see.
                      SAM
          No. Done.

A moment between them. Sam picks up the flowers and kisses
him tenderly on the head. Riggan is pleasantly surprised by
that kiss.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Now, I'm going to find something to
          put these flowers in.

She heads out of the room. Riggan lies there for a moment,
tranquil. After a moment he reaches up and touches his
bandages. Finally, he climbs out of the bed. We follow him
into...


INT. BATHROOM - ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

...the bathroom. He stands before the mirror. He stares at
his reflection for a few seconds, and slowly begins to remove
the bandages. We can see that Riggan's nose has been
reconstructed. It is a crooked, incomplete nose, like the one
Javier Bardem has.

                    RIGGAN
          I do look hideous.

In the reflection, Riggan sees Birdman sitting on the toilet.
They look at each other, but say nothing. Riggan puts the
bandages back on and we follow him out to...
                                            10/29/14   /   112.

INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

...the room. He looks around, but Sam is gone. He ambles over
to the window, his ass hanging out of the back of his
hospital robe. He opens the window and feels the sun and the
breeze on his swollen face. We just hear the sounds of the
people standing down in the parking lot. Media trucks. Fans.
We stay with Riggan, who seems to be thinking about
something. He sees a flock of birds dancing in the sky. Then
he grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins to
step up onto the sill.
The camera pans away from him to a table that has some photos
propped on it: One of he and Sam when she was a child. One
with Sylvia and Sam. A copy of Carver's "What we talk About
When We Talk About Love" laying on the surface.

The camera continues to pan until it comes to the door. Sam
enters with a small vase. She looks around...

                    SAM
          Dad?

She goes to the bathroom and peers in... nothing.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Dad...?

She spots the opened window and registers the sounds from
outside. Tentatively she walks toward the window. She gets
there, summons her courage and looks down. Nothing. Slowly,
confused, she tilts her head up and looks up into the sky. A
smile, filled with pride, begin to wash over her face.

               OVER BLACK

               Sounds of the innerspaces rushing forward.

               Then a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture.

               It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted 
               curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside 
               of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undersea 
               world at night. HEAR a symphony of underwater sounds: 
               landslide, metabolic sounds, the rare and secret noises that 
               certain undersea species share with each other. Also, the 
               hint of familiar music, twisted and distorted by the depths.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BEACH � NIGHT � SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW � RISING OUT OF 
               THE WATER, LOOKING AT

               It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We 
               see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low 
               dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses. Hear a 
               number of voices singing. It sounds like an eastern 
               university's alma mater, no longer distorted.

               EXT. BEACH � NIGHT � ANOTHER ANGLE

               Around a blazing bonfire, a group of young men and women, 
               beer cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the bota 
               Spanish leather wine-bag much in favor by beach and ski-bum 
               types.

               The group is swapping sentimental alma maters, weepily singing 
               eastern Ivy League anthems -� Dartmouth, Cornell, Harvard, 
               Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the others. They

               are Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, there is 
               considerable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie are more 
               serious.

               TOM

               Makes a clumsy attempt at snaring Chrissie, cups her from 
               behind. She squirms playfully out of his grasp. We discover 
               he's not especially sober.

                                     TOM
                         Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?

               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH � NIGHT

               Tom and Chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted 
               against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is 
               plodding along in the sand, winded.

               Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water, 
               leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is 
               shedding her clothes. Tom is trying to trail her by her 
               clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.

               But Chrissie is way ahead of him.

                                     CHRISSIE
                         C'mon!

               She runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly 
               into the water with a light "Whoops!" as the cold water sweeps 
               over her.

               Behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery 
               chorus of alma maters.

               Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that 
               passes her a dozen feet away. A pressure wave lifts her up, 
               then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.

                                     CHRISSIE
                         Tommy? Don't dunk me...

               She looks around for him, finds him still on the beach, his 
               feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his 
               ankles. She starts to swim back in to him.

               EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATER

               Her expression freezes. The water-bulge is racing towards 
               her. The first bump jolts her upright, out of the water to 
               her hips. She reaches under water to touch her leg. Whatever 
               she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is 
               slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet, 
               up and down, submerging her down to her open mouth, choking 
               off any scream she might try to make. Another jolt to her 
               body, driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the 
               surface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible 
               jerking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swirls until we're 
               sure it's all over.

               EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH

               In his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned 
               circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to 
               have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from 
               a tight sleeve. As he turns, we hear the alma maters in the 
               background, from the fire.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

               A shaft of morning sun blasts through the crack between the 
               bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the 
               heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. It catches Martin 
               Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.  
               The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on 
               with local fisherman's report and weather.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Hayes Landing reports conditions 
                         good, with stripers and jacks. The 
                         Coast Guard has no storm warning 
                         from Block Island to Cape Hatteras; 
                         a light chop with freshening winds, 
                         continued clear and mild... (etc.)

               Ellen Brody burrows her head under the covers, avoiding 
               morning for a few precious minutes more.

                                     BRODY
                         How come the sun didn't used to shine 
                         in here?

                                     ELLEN
                         'cause when we bought the house it 
                         was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the 
                         dogs.

               We hear the scampering toenails of two cocker spaniels 
               scrabbling around the foot of the bed. Brody swings out of 
               bed, wearing shorts, socks, and tee shirt.

                                     BRODY
                         Right.

                                     ELLEN
                         Do you see the kids?

                                     BRODY
                         Probably out in the back yard.

                                     ELLEN
                         In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
                              (she gives it the 
                              Boston sound)

                                     BRODY
                         The kids are in the yahd, playing 
                         near the cah. How's that sound?

                                     ELLEN
                         Like you're from N'Yawk.
                              (gives it Brooklyn 
                              sound)

                                     BRODY
                         Give me 30 years, I'll get it.

               He leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen.

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN - MORNING

               Brody enters, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee, 
               starts to fill kettle to boil water, the cold water rushes 
               through and out the burnt-out bottom of the kettle.

                                     BRODY
                         Did you burn another kettle? Y'know 
                         you're a fire hazard? This is the 
                         third one!

                                     ELLEN (O.S.)
                         I never hear the whistle.

                                     BRODY
                         Feed the dogs.

               Ellen Brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, enters from 
               upstairs. She's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call 
               an "Instant-On" person. Mornings are not her best time.

                                     ELLEN
                         You want to go through those?
                              (she indicates bag of 
                              clothes)
                         I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.  
                         It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity.  
                         Pick out what you want to keep -- 
                         it's mostly your city clothes.

                                     BRODY
                              (looking through bag, 
                              remembering)
                         I used to wear this to the Garden. 
                         Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.
                              (he puts it all behind)
                         Ship it.

                                     ELLEN
                         Don't be silly -� You're going to 
                         make summer better for them...

               Before Brody can answer, Michael, his oldest boy, enters, 
               holding his hand. There is bright new blood on it, but he is 
               sensibly unconcerned. It's a normal childhood scrape.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.

                                     BRODY
                         On the swing? I told you not to play 
                         near there until I sanded it down.
                              (to Ellen)
                         See what your son did?

                                     ELLEN
                         Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band-
                         aid.

               Michael goes on out and upstairs. Ellen fumbles in her pocket 
               and produces Brody's new glasses, which she holds out to 
               him.

                                     ELLEN
                         Don't forget these.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, yeah.
                              (he puts them on)
                         How do I look? Older, huh?

                                     ELLEN
                         I think they make you look sexy.

               Brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss her lightly. Then 
               more seriously.

                                     BRODY
                         Sexy, hm? What was I before?

                                     ELLEN
                         Older, sillier.

                                     BRODY
                              (as he goes to make 
                              coffee, he fumbles 
                              with the new glasses)
                         I don't want to depend on these 
                         things, y'know -� sometimes you can 
                         weaken your eyes.

               He looks out the window to the view beyond, discovering some 
               new wonder in the fresh sunlit morning.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW � OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

               Sean, the younger child, is happily romping in the summer 
               air, enjoying the very air he breathes.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's see...

               The phone rings.

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN � DAY

               Brody answers one of two phones on the wall.

                                     BRODY
                         Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... 
                         Well, what do they usually do, float 
                         or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll 
                         meet both of you at the beach in
                              (checks watch)
                         ...20 minutes, okay? Okay.
                              (hangs up)
                         First goddamn weekend of the summer.

               Michael reenters in bathing trunks, with a towel on his 
               shoulder, his hand washed, holding a band-aid ready for 
               application. Ellen takes it, and bandages the finger with 
               care and affection.

                                     ELLEN
                         There.
                              (to Brody)
                         What was that?

               Michael heads toward the beach.

                                     BRODY
                              (struggling to get 
                              his shirt on over 
                              his glasses)
                         The office.

               He gets his shirt on with Ellen's help. She flicks imaginary 
               dust from the badge on his chest.

                                     ELLEN
                         Be careful.

                                     BRODY
                         Here? You gotta be kiddin'.

               He gives her a light kiss, starts to go, with his cup.

                                     BRODY
                         Love ya.

                                     ELLEN
                              (kissing him back)
                         Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.

               At the door, he takes a windbreaker off a peg and goes on 
               out.

               We can see the Amity Police shoulder patch as he goes to a 
               van parked outside.

               EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MORNING

               Martin Brody's Country Squire police wagon rushes past, taking 
               the view to an enormous billboard depicting a typical summer 
               day in Amity. A beautiful model splashes in the gold surf, 
               languishing in a Solarcaine sun. AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written 
               above her flailing arms.

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               Three small figures in the landscape, walking the beach. The 
               surf is rough and there is sea-floor debris strewn about 
               from the receding tide.

               CLOSER ANGLE

               Deputy Hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred 
               yards down wind. Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police 
               attire, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in 
               last night, walk down the beach. Brody fingers the missing 
               girl's shoes, purse and clothes. In the daylight, Cassidy 
               misconducts himself, wavering between inflated maturity and 
               tear-blown adolescence.

                                     BRODY
                         Christine what?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one 
                         ever died on me before.

                                     BRODY
                         You picked her up on the ferry.

                                     CASSIDY
                         I didn't know her.

                                     BRODY
                         And nobody else saw her in the water?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Somebody could've -- I was sort of 
                         passed out.

                                     BRODY
                         Think she might've run out on you?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman 
                         do that. I'm sure she drowned.

                                     BRODY
                         You from around here?

                                     CASSIDY
                         No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's 
                         in Tuxedo, New York, though.

                                     BRODY
                         You here for the summer?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Some friends and me took a house.

                                     BRODY
                              (genuinely curious)
                         What d'you pay for a place just for 
                         the summer?

                                     CASSIDY
                         A thousand apiece, something like 
                         that. There's five of us. And we 
                         each kick in a hundred a week for 
                         beer and cleaning, stuff like that.

                                     BRODY
                         Pretty stiff.

               A shrill whistle makes them turn. Hendricks is fifty yards 
               away, on his knees. He blows again, a feeble report this 
               time.

                                     BRODY
                         Maybe that's your girl.

               Brody runs toward Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows 
               with:

                                     CASSIDY
                              (pathetically)
                         You can't make me look -- !

               MASTER ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE

               A skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune.

               The booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible.

               Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet.  
               Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and 
               ventures up. Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying 
               something at the same time. Brody nods understanding and 
               steps up cautiously and looks down. He adjusts his glasses, 
               trying to make sense of what he is looking at.

               Whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique.

               Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry 
               horseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil over the 
               top of the dune and down its slopes.

               Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves 
               him over. He shakes his head. An awkward moment. Then Cassidy 
               shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes 
               looking everywhere but down. Brody says something else and 
               Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. Brody puts 
               his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder.

               Nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.

               He, too, can't make out what it is at first. Then he 
               understands.

               The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected. He falls 
               backward in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes -- 
               it's her. Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling 
               close. Hear his breathing. He looks around, envisioning the 
               week ahead of him....

               QUICK SHARP CUT

               Chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, horribly 
               bitten. (NOTE: See Hooper's dialog in Sc. 91 for complete 
               description of corpse.)

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody walks through the door and enters his office, holding 
               a fizzing glass of Alka-Seltzer. Polly, his sixty-one year 
               old secretary follows close on his heels with her shorthand 
               pad of messages and reminders.

               In the outer office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chairs, 
               sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

               Brody dips into file drawers for the appropriate forms. He 
               gently turns on Polly, who is behind him.

                                     BRODY
                         If this is going to work, you've got 
                         to keep current stuff out here, and 
                         put 'closed' files in there. The 
                         'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?

               Brody slips behind his typewriter, putting paper in the 
               machine with the effortless ease of years of practice. He's 
               obviously no stranger to paperwork. He touch types, hardly 
               ever looking down, checking his notes and listening with one 
               ear to Polly.

               He is affected by what he's seen, but there's work to be 
               done.

                                     POLLY
                         This is in no order of importance, 
                         Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity 
                         Town Council on Aging this Monday 
                         night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fire 
                         Inspector wants you to go over the 
                         fireworks site with him before he 
                         catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly, 
                         you have a batch of calls about that 
                         new Karate school.

               CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPORT

               Brody has just typed the girl's name. He skips the space for 
               Cause-of-Death, and just under it types the Next-of-Kin 
               information he has collected from her wallet.

                                     POLLY
                         Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale, 
                         Tisberry's Hardware... they say it's 
                         those nine-year-olds from the school 
                         practicing karate on all those nice 
                         picket fences.

               The phone rings and Polly picks it up.

                                     POLLY
                         It's the Coroner. Somebody pass away 
                         in the night?

               Brody nestles the phone between ear and collar, listening, 
               as he turns to the typewriter.

                                     BRODY
                         Jesus, Santos.

               INSERT - ACCIDENT REPORT

               Cause-of-Death line rolls into place. The hammers punch out: 
               SHARK ATTACK.

               BRODY

               leans forward, staring at what he just wrote. Polly cocks 
               her head and removes the phone from his ear.

                                     POLLY
                         What's the matter?

               Brody takes a breath. A new resolve comes over him.

                                     BRODY
                         Polly, I want to know what water 
                         recreation is on for today.

                                     POLLY
                         Right this minute?

               Brody gets up and moves hastily toward the door.

               BRODY'S OUTER OFFICE

               Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody enters.

                                     BRODY
                              (To Hendricks)
                         Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' 
                         signs?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         We never had any. What's the problem?

               A local merchant comes through the door.

                                     LOCAL MERCHANT
                         Glad I caught you. There's a city 
                         truck with New Hampshire plates parked 
                         right in front of my...

               Brody pushes past him and out the door.

               EXT. AMITY MAIN STREET � DAY

               In the busy center of a town preparing for the big Fourth of 
               July weekend, Brody wends his way around sidewalk activity, 
               purpose and haste in each stride. As he turns a corner a 
               little man in a white smock emerges from the Funeral Parlor.

               This is Carl Santos, Amity's part-time coroner. Santos looks 
               both ways before crossing Colonial Drive.

               Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkward 
               course through an odd assortment of Schwinns that line the 
               sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence. Keisel 
               intercepts Brody on the run.

                                     KEISEL
                              (he stares at Brody's 
                              face)
                         Wait-a-minute.
                              (stares some more)
                         Glasses, right?

               Brody nods yes, and starts to move away, but Keisel holds on 
               to him.

                                     KEISEL
                         Look at those fences! Little guys 
                         about eight to ten years old. And 
                         look at this!

               He holds up bicycle. The bicycle's spokes are bent and broken 
               from some sort of blows.

                                     KEISEL
                         They did that with their bare hands.

                                     BRODY
                         Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?

               ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - PORCH

               Santos emerges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thirties 
               editor of the Amity Gazette. Together they cut a beeline for 
               the other side of the street.

               ANGLE - AMITY STREET

               Past taverns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction 
               and July Fourth posters, Brody enters Hardware and Sporting 
               Goods... so overstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck 
               chairs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus of color 
               from the display window to the sidewalk.

               INT. HARDWARE STORE � DAY

               The store proprietor is busy at work on an inventory list 
               with a mainland delivery man.

                                     LYNWOOD
                         Stuff's no good to me in August when 
                         the Pilgrims come in June...
                              (to Brody)
                         Go on and help yourself to whatever 
                         you need, Chief. Can you work the 
                         register?

               EXT. HARDWARE STORE AND STREET - DAY

               Brody emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, 
               paint, and brushes to close every beach on the island. He 
               starts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the 
               street in the patrol jeep. He stops fast enough to call 
               attention, leans out the window.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Polly told me to tell you there's a 
                         scout troop in Avril Bay doing the 
                         mile swim for their Merit Badges. I 
                         couldn't call them in, there's no 
                         phone out there.

                                     BRODY
                              (hands him the sign 
                              material)
                         Get out of there � take these back 
                         to the office and make up some 'Beach 
                         Closed' signs, and let Polly do the 
                         printing.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         What's the matter with my printing?

               EXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY � DAY

               Revealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity, exchanging 
               anxieties with Ben Meadows and Coroner Santos and two other 
               city Selectmen. They come out in a group, reach the sunlight, 
               and squint down the street as Brody careens around the corner 
               and out of sight. Deputy Hendricks, laden with his arts and 
               crafts, passes them on the street front.

                                     VAUGHN
                         What have you got there, Lenny?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         We had a shark attack at South Chop 
                         this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta 
                         batten down the beach.

               Vaughn and group exchange horrified looks, but we get the 
               impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Who've you told this to, Lenny?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I just found out about it -- but 
                         there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the 
                         water a coupla miles down the coast 
                         from where we found the girl. Avril 
                         Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry 
                         them off.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Meadows)
                         Take my car, okay?
                              (to Hendricks)
                         You come with us, Lenny.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I've got all these signs here...

                                     VAUGHN
                         C'mon, it'll give us time to think 
                         about what they're going to say.

               They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dorado with Vaughn Realty 
               signs on the doors.

               EXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY

               A flotilla of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that 
               marks the official course. A rowboat with Scoutmaster using 
               a bullhorn keeps pace, and urges the boys on.

                                     SCOUTMASTER
                              (bullhorn effect)
                         Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofner. 
                         Boyle, keep your head up. Alberts, 
                         keep kicking...
                              (etc., ad lib)

               EXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY

               Two older Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboards, 
               while some Parents shade their eyes from the sun, watching 
               their offspring. Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep, 
               and starts toward the people. Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac 
               pulls up and skids to a stop. In it are Vaughn, Meadows, the 
               Doctor, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his arms still 
               full of sign material. Vaughn intercepts Brody, the others 
               circle around him, effectively slowing his progress through 
               the sand to the scouts.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin!
                              (he catches up with 
                              him)
                         Are you going to shut down the beach 
                         on your own authority?

                                     BRODY
                         Do I need any more authority?

                                     MEADOWS
                         Technically, you need the instruction 
                         of a civic ordinance, or a special 
                         meeting of the town selectmen...

                                     VAUGHN
                              (the good guy)
                         That's just going by the book. We're 
                         just a little anxious that you're 
                         rushing into something serious here. 
                         This is your first summer.

                                     BRODY
                         Now tell me something I don't know.

                                     VAUGHN
                         All I'm saying is that Amity is a 
                         summer town -- we need summer dollars, 
                         and if they can't swim here, they'll 
                         use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long 
                         Island.

                                     BRODY
                         So we should set out a smorgasbord?

                                     MEADOWS
                         We're not even sure what it was.

                                     BRODY
                         What else could've done that?

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Doctor)
                         Boat propeller?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I think, possibly... sure. A boating 
                         accident.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Some weekend tramp accidentally goes 
                         swimming too far, she's a little 
                         drunk, a fishing boat comes along --

                                     MEADOWS
                         Remember when Fred Ganz went 
                         scalloping in his BVD's? He was going 
                         to swim to New Bedford, he said.

               The men all laugh, ad lib their remembrances of this 
               foolishness.

                                     MEADOWS
                         ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him 
                         in his net...?

                                     BRODY
                              (interrupting the 
                              merriment)
                         Doctor, you're the one who told me 
                         what it was!

                                     DOCTOR
                         I was wrong. We'll have to amend the 
                         report.

                                     MEADOWS
                         We never had that kind of trouble 
                         here.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I don't think you can appreciate the 
                         gut reaction people have to these 
                         things.

                                     BRODY
                         I was only reacting to what I was 
                         told.

               Brody looks out to the water where the scouts are rounding 
               another buoy on the home stretch.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (taking Brody aside)
                         It's all psychological, anyway. You 
                         yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 
                         'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've 
                         got a panic on our hands. I think we 
                         all agree we don't need a panic this 
                         close to the 4th of July.

               Vaughn indicates the beach where the Scouts are flopping out 
               onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.

                                     BRODY
                         I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't 
                         you make Hendricks Chief? His family's 
                         been here since the Puritans -- half 
                         this island are his cousins.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, we hired the best man we 
                         could find.

                         We need someone who isn't prejudiced 
                         by old feuds or family ties, someone 
                         who can referee things.

                                     MEADOWS
                         You have our complete support.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Now then. We've got a vandalism 
                         problem we ought to talk about...

               The others surround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to 
               the cars, ad libbing their problem with the little karate 
               choppers.

               Hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's 
               Cadillac. Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmers 
               who are vigorously toweling off in the background.

               EXT. AMITY STREET - DAY

               In front of Amity's only Music Store, a battered old pick-up 
               truck pulls in to the curb. Quint and his mate cross silently 
               heading into the music store.

               INT. AMITY MUSIC STORE - DAY

               A gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance. Inside the 
               store, a ten-year-old boy is being shown a clarinet. He is 
               playing a mellow low tone, and running "Ode to Joy." Quint 
               looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets 
               his hand drop on the counter with a slap that sounds like a 
               club on flesh. The Shopkeeper abandons the little boy and 
               meets Quint.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         Hello, Mr. Quint.

                                     QUINT
                         Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, 
                         Okay? I ordered them.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                              (finding them under 
                              the counter)
                         Yessir, right here. What do those 
                         fish do, eat this stuff?

                                     QUINT
                         They choke on it.

               Without waiting for it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming 
               wire in his gnarled fist, and drops a bill on the counter.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         Bye now.

               No answer from Quint, who stops and sings along with the 
               boy.

               The little kid's music degenerates into a series of awkward 
               squeaks and blurps, as Quint stares at him. Quint continues 
               out the door, threading his way through the people in the 
               street like some great fish. As he gets up into the cab of 
               his pick-up, its door swings open so we can see a crude 
               stylized shark decorating its side. It slams behind him as 
               Quint gets in and drives away.

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               A plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean. There's 
               enough there to satisfy the most gluttonous shark. Buoyant, 
               joyful, she splashes away in abandon. From her, we pan off 
               to reveal other cheerful bathers enjoying that last 
               uncluttered weekend before the season starts in earnest.

               ANGLE ON THE WATERLINE

               A Man and his dog are romping at the water's edge. The Man 
               is throwing a stick out into the surf, the dog, a happy 
               retriever, is bounding into the waves after it.

               TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

               A Girl and her Boyfriend leave their blanket and run for the 
               water, playing tag, chasing each other, having a wonderful 
               time.

               ANGLE ON BIRTHDAY PARTY ON THE SAND - MARTIN AND ELLEN BRODY

               He is sitting stiffly in a beach chair, scanning the beach 
               with careful, cautious looks, eyeballing everything that's 
               going on.

               Around their particular blanket and umbrella are a number of 
               adults and their kids, the youngsters gathered to celebrate 
               Michael's birthday. Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake 
               from a cooler chest to the raucous 10-year-olds. Michael's 
               hand is still bandaged.

                                     MAX TAFT
                              (an adult)
                         Looks like another big season. Gets 
                         worse every year.

                                     MRS. TAFT
                         And none of them from the Island. 
                         Just a lot of bother.

               Brody (and we) hear a shrill scream from the water. He 
               stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening 
               out there.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

               The young lady is disappearing under the water, pulled under 
               the waves by some force. She is shrieking. She pops right up 
               again riding the shoulders of her boyfriend, who pulled her 
               under. She's laughing hysterically. Brody is unamused.

               THE ADULTS

                                     BRODY
                              (to Taft)
                         What?

                                     TAFT
                         Present company excepted, but off-
                         islanders are a pain in the butt. 
                         Pardon my French.

               Ellen captures Sean, and holds him playfully, an example.

                                     ELLEN
                         What about this kid? What if he were 
                         born here. That make him an islander?

                                     TAFT
                         Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an 
                         oven, it don't make them muffins.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!

               Brody rumples his hair and sets him off to play.

               ANGLE ON ANOTHER SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE

               It's Alex Kintner, and his mother, nearby, reading a novel.

               Alex is towing a funny rubber raft, and headed for the water.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you 
                         think you're going?

                                     ALEX
                         Water. Just once more, please?

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Let me see your fingers --

               He holds out his hands.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes 
                         more.

               Alex starts for the ocean. Behind him, Michael and his gang 
               are also heading for the inviting waves. Brody is watching 
               them go, his spine rigid with tension.

               MAN AND HIS DOG

               As Alex and the boys hit the water, we see the man throwing 
               his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly after 
               it.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Out beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing 
               around, out way too far, isolated from the other swimmers.

               UNDERWATER VIEW - EXT. - DAY

               A fish's-eye view of the bathers: lots of little kicking 
               legs, rafts with tasty arms dangling in the blue, slowing 
               circling, favoring one raft (little Alex's). The Kintner 
               boy's legs and arms are kicking and paddling, producing 
               bizarre underwater vibrations of more than passing interest.  
               Dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

               ON THE BEACH

               Brody is half-rising, looking out over the water. The Fat 
               Lady is not where he remembered her. He scans the water 
               anxiously.

                                     ELLEN
                         Do you want the boys to come in? 
                         Honey, if you're worried...

               A Black Object swims across the water. It's the dog, breasting 
               against the surf.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               It's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing. A black object swims 
               up to her. It's not the dog. It rears up out of the water.

               It's a man in a black bathing cap. They exchange distant 
               pleasantries, he strokes away.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - WATER

               Alex Kintner, paddling around, making boat sounds, tooting, 
               going "vroom, vroom."

               ANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIRL

               They kiss, embrace, kiss again. Strong stuff. They sink 
               beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace.

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS

               He's trying to salvage a soggy piece of birthday cake, holding 
               it above the water, paddling with his other hand. The bandage 
               has come part way loose, and his cut is trailing in the water.

               BRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH

               Ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing 
               himself to relax part way. His eyes still nervously scan the 
               beach in a constant surveillance. Mr. Keisel is coming out 
               of the water, toweling off vigorously, exclaiming to himself.

                                     BRODY
                              (to Keisel)
                         How's the water?

                                     KEISEL
                         Too cold. I'm going in again Labor 
                         Day. Hope we get this weather next 
                         weekend.

                                     ELLEN
                         You're very tight, y'know?
                              (digs in)
                         Right there.

                                     BRODY
                         Ow.
                              (he sees something)
                         He's gotta be more careful in the 
                         water...

               ANGLE ON THE GANG PLAYING IN THE WATER

               Michael has just been drenched. He splashes back. A big 
               waterfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the 
               water, shouting battle cries and karate whoops. Alex is 
               paddling around near them, but not involved with them.

               ALONG THE WATERLINE ON THE BEACH

               The Man with the Dog is whistling into the ocean, looking 
               for his dog.

                                     DOG MAN
                         Buster! Hey, Buster! Here boy!
                              (whistles)
                         He continues to ad lib calling his 
                         dog, but there's no answer, no dog 
                         in the water.

               THE WATERFRONT

               A huge splash explodes in the water near the gang, an eruption 
               of foam and spray that stops everyone cold for a moment.  
               They stop to see who was responsible.

                                     A KID (MATHEW)
                         Hey, no fair splashing in the eyes!

               Before anyone can answer, another kid (P.J.) renews the 
               battle, whooping a karate cry, and slashing at the water 
               with his hand like a little kung-fu warrior, advancing through 
               the waves.

               CLOSE ON MATHEW, SPLASHING BACK

               He hits the water, which sprays up suspiciously pink. He 
               stares at it, surprised.

               CLOSE ON P.J.

               His hands are dripping deep pink, the red matting his hair, 
               running into his eyes. He looks down. The boys are surrounded 
               with a deep pink slick, their little bodies ringed by a 
               spreading stain of blood.

               ANGLE ON SHORE, A TOURIST AND HIS WIFE

               He's pointing frantically out to sea.

                                     TOURIST
                         Something in the water. Right there! 
                         Didn't anyone see it?

                                     WOMAN
                         There's blood in the water.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               He leaps to his feet, nearly knocking Ellen over, and starts 
               for the water.

                                     ELLEN
                         What is it...?

               Brody is pelting towards the water. He kicks sand over an 
               annoyed Mrs. Kintner, who looks up, just in time to hear 
               Brody's bellow.

                                     BRODY
                         Michael! Sean! Out of the water. 
                         Everybody out of the water! Michael! 
                         Get out!

               His urgency communicates itself to the others. Ellen snatches 
               Sean up from where he's been playing in the sand. Other 
               parents are calling their kids, hysteria mounting. People 
               rush into the water, dragging their children and families 
               bodily out of the ocean. The first kids coming out of the 
               surf are frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off 
               their bodies. The sight of the red sends the beach into a 
               full panic.

               CLOSE ON BRODY

               He rushes into the water, up to his ankles, and suddenly 
               stops, unable to move into deeper water. He is urging Michael 
               out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through 
               the surf towards his dad. He stands there immobilized by the 
               water, nervously helping people out of it onto the beach.

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL

               As he emerges from the water, Alex Kintner's raft washes in 
               behind him, ripped in half, the water pink, the foam spreading 
               the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks.

               ANGLE ON MRS. KINTNER

               Her voice rising into panic and hysteria with each unanswered 
               cry.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Alex! Alex? Alex...!

               We are looking at the closed double white front doors of the 
               building, through which we can hear a rolling boil of agitated 
               conversation. After a beat, they open to reveal Mrs. Kintner, 
               looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of God; 
               in effect, she has. Her eyes are puffy and swollen from 
               weeping, her clothing is put on and fastened awkwardly, her 
               gait is not normal. As she walks toward us, Quint enters 
               with his back to us, they pass without notice; Mrs. Kintner 
               moving out of sight, Quint leading us through the doors into 
               the town hall.

               INT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               A crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway, 
               their voices a babble of confusion. Many of them are gathered 
               around a roughly lettered notice that has been posted on the 
               town's official bulletin board. It reads.

               "A $3000 BOUNTY TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO CATCH AND KILL THE 
               SHARK THAT KILLED ALEX M. KINTNER ON SUNDAY, JUNE 29, ON THE 
               AMITY TOWN BEACH."

               Vaughn and Brody are on the outskirts of the crowd, which 
               includes Meadows, some selectmen, and others.

                                     BRODY
                         Look, I've got to talk to her. This 
                         isn't a contest we want the whole 
                         country entering.

                                     MEADOWS
                         I agree. If she's going to advertise, 
                         I wouldn't recommend out-of-town 
                         papers. Amity people could take care 
                         of this.

                                     BRODY
                         I'm responsible for public safety 
                         around here...

                                     VAUGHN
                         Then go out tomorrow and make sure 
                         no one gets hurt.
                              (addressing the crowd)
                         Everybody, could I have your 
                         attention? Since this affects all of 
                         us, I suggest we move into council 
                         chambers, where there's more room...

               There is a flurry and a bustle as everyone rearranges 
               themselves and makes their way into the Amity Selectmen's 
               Council Chambers.

               INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

               The crowd is thronging into the large room. Already in the 
               room is a solitary figure, standing all the way in the rear, 
               watching everyone as they enter. Against the back wall is a 
               large blackboard used for town business during meetings.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Well, here we all are; anyone have 
                         any special questions?

                                     DENHERDER
                         Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in 
                         cash or check?
                              (laughter from all)

                                     VAUGHN
                         That's private business between you 
                         brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.
                              (to Brody)

                                     BRODY
                              (stepping in)
                         I'd like to tell you what we're doing 
                         so far. These are some of the steps 
                         I've taken as Chief of Police...

                                     MEADOWS
                              (leading the direction 
                              of the discussion)
                         What's going on with the beaches, 
                         Chief?

               All react.

                                     BRODY
                         I'll get to that in a minute. First, 
                         I plan to start our seasonal summer 
                         help early, and to use shark spotters 
                         on beaches open to the sea. I'd like 
                         cooperation from local fishermen, 
                         and I've also contacted the 
                         Oceanographic Institute over on the 
                         mainland.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (Interrupting -- sotto 
                              voice to Brody)
                         No need to involve outsiders in our 
                         business, Martin.

                                     WOMAN
                         Are you going to close the beaches?

                                     BRODY
                         Larry and I have also decided to 
                         close the beaches for a short time.

               Pandemonium. A collective nerve has been touched.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Only 24 hours!

                                     BRODY
                         I didn't agree to that!

                                     MRS. TAFT
                         That official business could take 
                         all summer!

                                     MR. KEISEL
                         Maybe it's better to close.

               Two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides 
               vociferously, ad libbing assent or dissent depending on the 
               point of view held forth.

                     THOSE IN FAVOR

                         MR. WISEMAN
                 We should make sure 
                 there is no danger.

                         MR. HASSETT
                 I didn't raise my kids to be some 
                 fish's lunch! 

                                                       THOSE OPPOSED

                                                       MRS. TAFT
                                               The motel is all I own -- 
                                               you pull the plug on this 
                                               town and I go down the 
                                               drain with it.

                                                       MR. POSNER
                                               Nobody's seen a shark.

                                                       MR. POLK
                                               We'll lose business, we 
                                               lose taxes, we lose our 
                                               shirts!

               ANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM

               He has just run his large, coarse fingernails over the 
               blackboard. He is a large, rough man, a professional fisherman 
               marked by daily physical toil, About 45 or 50, it's hard to 
               tell where the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin. There 
               is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killer-
               whale.

                                     QUINT
                              (after taking a deep 
                              breath)
                         You all know me. You know what I do 
                         for a living. I'll go out and get 
                         this bird for you. He's a bad one 
                         and it's not like goin' down the 
                         pond chasing blue-gills and tommy-
                         cods. This is a fish that can swallow 
                         a man whole. A little shakin', a 
                         little tenderizing and down ya' go.
                              (a look to Vaughn)
                         You gotta get this fellow and get 
                         him quick. If you do, it'll bring a 
                         lot of tourist business just to see 
                         him and you've got your business 
                         back on a paying basis.
                              (beat)
                         A shark of that size is no pleasure 
                         and I value my neck at a hell of a 
                         lot more'n 3,000 bucks.
                              (a deadly look)
                         I'll find him for three. But I'll 
                         kill him for ten.

               Crowd reaction.

                                     QUINT
                              (he rises up)
                         The bastard is costing you more'n 
                         that every day. Do you wanna stay 
                         alive and annee up the ten or play 
                         it cheap and be on welfare next 
                         winter.
                              (a final moment)
                         I'm gonna kill this thing... just a 
                         matter of whether I do it now -- or 
                         at the end of summer.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the 
                         Selectmen will take your offer under 
                         advisement

               INT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

               A riffly blur, color alternating with black and white. The 
               dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white 
               rendering of eight species of shark. The banner at the top 
               of the page reads: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATERS.

               The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of 
               scar tissue on six former shark victims. Riffling -- stop.

               Photograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools, 
               framed by the enormous jaws of a prehistoric shark from the

               BRODY

               his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library 
               books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. The 
               door opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's 
               mood.

                                     ELLEN
                         Can you stand something to eat?

                                     BRODY
                         Love a cup of tea. With lemon.

               Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window 
               which overlooks the south bay. It is the hour of dusk.

                                     ELLEN
                         Mikey loves his birthday present.

                                     BRODY
                         Where is he?

                                     ELLEN
                              (with a slight laugh)
                         He's sitting in it.

               Brody gets up, concerned, and joins her at the window.

                                     ELLEN
                         Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty 
                         with a double-knot.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school 
               chums are in the water, swimming around it. Brody opens the 
               window and calls down:

                                     BRODY
                         Son! -- Out of the water now!

                                     MICHAEL
                         My boat's neat, dad!

                                     BRODY
                              (turning to Ellen)
                         I want him out of the ocean.

                                     ELLEN
                         It's three feet deep, Martin

                                     BRODY
                              (angry now)
                         Michael! Come inside!

                                     ELLEN
                         It's his birthday present, and you 
                         closed the beach, Honey. I told him 
                         not to go in the water after what 
                         happened yesterday. I don't believe 
                         he'll ever do it again.

                                     BRODY
                         I told him not to go out until he 
                         memorized the handbook and the safety 
                         safety regulations, until he was 
                         sure of himself...

               Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying 
               a reproduction of the famous painting "The Gulf Stream," 
               showing a black fisherman in a small dinghy similar to 
               Michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man-eating 
               sharks, circling his boat.

                                     ELLEN
                         You heard your father! Out right 
                         now!

               SUNSET ON THE BEACH

               Hendricks and another deputy are assisting Brody. Silhouettes 
               of townspeople look on like mourners at a funeral.

               In the background some workmen are taking down the shutters 
               from a quaint summer cottage. They pause to watch the 
               declining moments of the day.

               Three Selectmen also stand watching. One of them seems to be 
               whispering bounty news to three youngish men on a nearby 
               dune.

               Sounds: Surf and hammering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN AND PIER - NIGHT

               Selectman Denherder and his buddy, Charlie, a professional 
               angler, row towards a tumble-down jetty that leads fifty 
               feet out into the black water.

                                     DENHERDER
                         You wanna call it a night after here?

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's only two-thirty. What, are you 
                         tired?

                                     DENHERDER
                         Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind 
                         three nibbles back.

               Denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the 
               wheelbarrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog 
               chain and a large patched inner tube. Charlie takes out a 
               monster hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the 
               rickety pier that is only about five feet across.

                                     DENHERDER
                              (reaching into the 
                              bag)
                         Leg of lamb this time?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!

                                     DENHERDER
                              (a hyena laugh)
                         We're blowin' half the bounty on 
                         bait --

               The splintered pier sways to and fro as the men reach the 
               end and start to work. Charlie baits the hook with a massive 
               chunk of sirloin while Denherder secures the loose end of 
               chain to a skinny piling. Charlie then fastens the inner 
               tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

                                     DENHERDER
                         One more after this, then I'm going 
                         home.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Set?

               Denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it 
               is. Charlie heaves the bait. Splash! The inner tube follows 
               and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward, the chain 
               playing out from the wheelbarrow.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tide's taking it right out.

               Charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling. He 
               turns on his transistor radio and loops one end around a 
               fractured board. Denherder paces, bored to death.

                                     DENHERDER
                         You do this all the time, right, 
                         Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Twenty years.

                                     DENHERDER
                         I can't believe that people pay money 
                         to go fishing. This is really dumb. 
                         This isn't even relaxing... it's 
                         just boring.

               CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

               Suddenly zipping out, faster and faster, as both men 
               straighten.

               Denherder is goggle-eyed.

                                     DENHERDER
                         Hey! What's this?

               The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the 
               wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty. A section of chain 
               tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into 
               the air. Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing 
               out to sea in a wake of white water, suddenly dips under.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Look at him take it!

                                     DENHERDER
                         Do I set the goddam hook?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!

               It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow 
               pilings.

               CLOSE - PILING

               A lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings SNAP with a 
               resounding CRACK.

               ANGLE - JETTY

               The end of the jetty is yanked loose. Denherder is flipped 
               like a chip over the side and into the cold night water, 
               where he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber.

               DENHERDER'S POINT OF VIEW

               The severed section of jetty, a joined platform of footboards, 
               is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top 
               of it, his lit pipe still going.

                                     DENHERDER
                         CHARLIE! JUMP!

               Charlie rolls into the water, sputters, turns to watch the 
               flotilla of wood draw away.

               CLOSE - CHARLIE

               looking seaward.

               CHARLIE'S POINT OF VIEW

               The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back 
               in his direction.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Holy Jesus Christ!

               Denherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out 
               of the water.

                                     DENHERDER
                         Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim!

               Charlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore. The jetty 
               is getting closer. Suddenly, an enormous black fin breaks 
               water like a periscope, making course corrections as it comes 
               for Charlie.

               Denherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his 
               balance on his way to help Charlie. Charlie has reached the 
               last pylon toward open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold. 
               But --

               INSERT - CHARLIE'S HANDS

               The algae is too slippery, and his fingers keep sliding back.

               That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky 
               and Charlie manages, with Denherder's desperate help, to 
               make it safely to shore. The remains of the pier float belly-
               up in the inlet.

               CLOSE ON THE HARBORMASTER OF AMITY - DAY

               He is sitting on a little canvas folding chair, eating a 
               bowl of Cheerios with milk and sugar, watching a panorama of 
               ineptitude and greed unfold before his old seaman's eyes.

               The Amity Pier area is a minor madhouse: out-of-state cars 
               elbow local vehicles for parking space at the foot of the 
               dock, and a parade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islanders, 
               off-islanders, tourist, and others shout and push their way 
               onto the crowded pier, each carrying some bizarre or 
               appropriate tool for the real or imagined capture of an 
               unarmed shark of indeterminate size.

               Rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, harpoons, 
               shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; every fishing supply 
               store and sporting goods house within a hundred miles has 
               been cannibalized to equip this weird array.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS ARRIVING ON THE SCENE

               Not having room to bring their police vehicle anywhere near 
               this mess, they are proceeding on foot into the confusion.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         ...So then Denherder and Charlie sat 
                         there trying to catch their breath, 
                         and figuring out how to explain to 
                         Charlie's wife what happened to her 
                         freezer full of meat.

                                     BRODY
                         That wasn't funny.

               Some of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of 
               recognition, or an ad libbed "Hi, Lenny," or "Hey, Lenny."

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in 
                         Field and Stream.

                                     BRODY
                         Looks more like the readers of the 
                         National Enquirer.

               ANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIER

               An argument is in progress between and Out-of-Towner and the 
               Boat Rental Man.

                                     OUT-OF-TOWNER
                         You're charging me double the usual 
                         rent! I didn't come up here all the 
                         way from New Rochelle to be gouged 
                         by some Yankee Cracker!

                                     BOAT RENTAL MAN
                         Prices go up June First every year. 
                         You want a nice cheap, leaky boat, 
                         you go down to the Hamptons.
                              (he sees Brody)
                         Right, Chief?

               ANGLE LOOKING OUT TO SEA

               Making its way through the channel towards the dock is a 
               sleek, expensive runabout with the name "Fascinatin' Rhythm" 
               on the stern. It's professionally handled, and rumbles in as 
               it coasts in towards the dock area. Some other boats clear 
               the way for it, zig-zagging in the harbor, causing an annoying 
               chop.

               CLOSE ON BOAT

               Matt Hooper, a bearded, bespectacled young man with an intent 
               look, is maneuvering the vessel peering through his windscreen 
               at the ragtag collection of seafaring loonies all around 
               him.

               BACK TO DOCKSIDE

               Hendricks is mediating the argument between the two men, and 
               we can hear a plaintive "But Lenny," from the local as Brody 
               sees something that makes him move towards the other side of 
               the dock. We see him cross to a little boat built for two or 
               three that is settling low in the water as a seventh man 
               climbs in with his gear.

                                     BRODY
                         Hey! You know how many men that's 
                         supposed to hold?

                                     MAN IN BOAT (WALTER)
                         Whatever's safe, right?

                                     BRODY
                         What you got ain't safe. You take 
                         some guys off or you don't go out.

               BEN GARDNER AND HIS BOAT, FLICKA

               Matt Hooper is gliding into the dockside, and Ben throws him 
               a line to help make fast as he moors. It's a small island of 
               courtesy in an otherwise discourteous mob. Hooper nods 
               politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

                                     HOOPER
                         Hello.

                                     GARDNER
                         Hello, back.

               He's standing near where Brody is finishing after his 
               encounter with the chummers.

               Brody approaches Ben Gardner.

                                     BRODY
                         You going out too, Ben?

                                     GARDNER
                         Might give it a try. That three 
                         thousand bounty beats working for a 
                         living.
                              (yells to his Mate)
                         We ready?

               The Mate nods "Yes" and starts to prepare to get under way.

               Ben and his Mate move away from the dock, headed towards the 
               channel and the open sea leaving Felix and Pratt to scamper 
               around the dock looking for another ride.

               ANOTHER DOCK AREA, CLOSE BY

               A particularly awkward moment between a small sailboat and a 
               couple of powerboats. The sailboat is trying to hoist sail 
               to make it away from the pier under sail, a real yachtsman's 
               conceit, since Hornblower himself probably couldn't navigate 
               through this mess. Brody, a landlubber for sure, is trying 
               to direct traffic to untangle this new mess.

                                     BRODY
                         Just back up! No, the other way! Cut 
                         it to your left! Your other left! 
                         The big boat, your front end is out 
                         way too far. Little boat, stay still!

               Amidst all this, we can hear the angry shouts of the entangled 
               crews.

                                     SKIPPER 1 (THE SAILBOAT)
                         Dammit, a vessel under sail has the 
                         right of way!

                                     SKIPPER 2 (MOTORBOAT)
                         You schmuck, you ain't under sail, 
                         you're goddam drifting!

                                     HOOPER
                              (stepping in to help)
                         Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well, 
                         scull it out!

                                     SAILBOAT SKIPPER
                         Tell that stinkpotter to belay!

                                     MOTORBOAT SKIPPER
                         Tell that ragsetter I'm going to 
                         poke him in the snoot!

                                     HOOPER
                         Just cast off in turn and make for 
                         the channel, OK?

                                     BRODY
                         Thanks.

               Brody starts back towards the shore, Hooper is by his side.

                                     HOOPER
                         Excuse me, I wonder if you could 
                         tell me...

               Before he can finish, Brody spots something on shore that 
               moves him to shout to his deputy.

                                     HOOPER
                              (noticing something)
                         Is that dynamite?

               Brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off.

               He holds out his hand.

                                     BRODY
                         If that's dynamite, give it here, or 
                         don't leave port.

                                     MAN
                         Aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks. Sharks 
                         like fireworks, it attracts them.

                                     BRODY
                         Hand it over.

               The man passes Brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks.

               Brody tucks the dynamite under his arm, and continues down 
               the pier. Hooper is still with him.

               All around them are two distinctly different breeds; the 
               quiet pros, like Ben Gardner, in well-worn, comfortable 
               clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateur 
               crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, silly 
               tourist clothing.

               INT. DOCK SHED - DAY

               Brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get 
               Hendricks' attention. He throws a handful of washers at the 
               window.

                                     HOOPER
                         There's a fantail launch out there 
                         that won't make it beyond the 
                         breakwater.

                                     BRODY
                         You're tellin' me. I swear, this 
                         town has gone crazy.

                                     HOOPER
                         Officer, I wonder if you could tell 
                         me where I could find Chief Brody?

                                     BRODY
                         Who are you?

                              (holds out his hand)

               EXTERIOR - OCEAN - DAY

               Ben Gardner's boat is in the lead with Gardner's shouting 
               derisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. The 
               armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fifteen 
               boats in all. One man heaves cherry bombs into the water. A 
               smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us 
               Barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while 
               his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup.

               A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading 
               instructions aloud from a book entitled "Sharks - East Coast, 
               Vol. I."

               boatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net 
               overboard, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals 
               look professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000 
               make it impossible for everybody. Collisions are barely 
               averted.

               THE RUBE GOLDBERG ERROR

               The Out-of-Towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and

               death struggle, his rod in a tight arc. His buddy leaps across 
               to lend a hand.

               Twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues.

               This time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop 
               fishermen. Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle 
               of tackle springs from the water. They have hooked each other.

               Joy turns to swearing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud 
               the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his 
               Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it 
               were a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes --

               Both the Out-of-Towners and the Scallop Fisherman falls over 
               backward --

               ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT

               Three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast 
               arc. A few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin 
               crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty 
               tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the other two 
               slapping the angler on the back.

               CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX

               They spot it and sour.

                                     PRATT
                         Well, get over there! He ain't caught 
                         it yet!

               The owner of Pratt's boat throws it forward and Pratt removes 
               a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt. He tests it, 
               firing once in the air. As they near the scene of the 
               struggle, eleven other boats begin converging, until --

               HARRY'S BOAT

               Everyone wants to get into the act. They are attacking the

               threshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his 
               automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun. There 
               are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck 
               from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shark 
               stops threshing.

               FELIX AND PRATT

               Their boat has moved close to the shark, closer than Harry's.

                                     PRATT
                              (exultant)
                         Hand me that pole! Quick!

               One of his party in the over-filled boat grabs a gaff and 
               leans out to grab the moribund shark. But Harry won't give 
               up the line, still reeling in.

                                     HARRY
                         Beat it! I hooked him!

                                     PRATT
                         How's the family, Harry?
                              (to the man with gaff)
                         Go on and do it!

                                     MAN WITH GAFF
                         We split down the middle?

               Pratt nods reluctantly. The man swings, lodges the gaff and 
               hauls the shark up onto the gunwale. A paroxysm of cheers 
               from the surrounding boats. Smoke flares are fired into the 
               air.

                                     HARRY
                              (a tug-of-war)
                         Let go my shark!

               It is a ten-foot tiger, and what a mess -- splattered with 
               bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices. 
               But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to 
               capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fires six times with his 
               .45. The bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and 
               split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water 
               rises. Everybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

               INT. MORGUE - DAY

               The Amity Morgue is also the Amity Funeral Home, a Victorian 
               house that normally serves as the community's mortuary. The 
               Coroner, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as 
               Hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder 
               with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measurement 
               with a calibrator or calipers.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

               With a shrug, the Coroner slides open the drawer.

               CLOSE ON HOOPER

               He is looking down as the drawer slides past him, still matter-
               of-fact, turning on his recorder.

                                     HOOPER
                         Victim One, identified as Christine 
                         Watkins, female Caucasian...

               The sheet has just been lifted, and Hooper stares down at 
               the lump on the slab. He stops, turns off his recorder as 
               emotions wage war with his senses. Rationality wins, and he 
               turns on the recorder again.

                                     HOOPER
                         ...height and weight may only be 
                         estimated from partial remains. Torso 
                         severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated 
                         with no major organs remaining. May 
                         I have a drink of water? Right arm 
                         severed above the elbow with massive 
                         tissue loss from upper musculature. 
                         Portions of denuded bone remaining.
                              (tense, to Brody)
                         -- did you notify the coast guard?

                                     BRODY
                         No, it was local jurisdiction.

                                     HOOPER
                         Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum 
                         and portions of ribcage intact.
                              (to Brody)
                         Please don't smoke. With minor post-
                         mortem lacerations and abrasions. 
                         Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy 
                         feeding pattern of large squali, 
                         possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or 
                         isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss 
                         and post-mortem erosion of bite 
                         surfaces prevent detailed analysis; 
                         however, teeth and jaws of the 
                         attacking squali must be considered 
                         above average for these waters.
                              (to Brody again)
                         -- Did you go out in a boat and look 
                         around?

                                     BRODY
                         No, we just checked the beach...

                                     HOOPER
                              (turns off the recorder)
                         It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a 
                         boat propeller, or a coral reef, or 
                         Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It 
                         was a shark.

               EXT. DOCK AREA - DAY

               We open close on ugly, open shark's jaws, still oozing blood 
               and gore. As the shark is hoisted up into the air on a gin-
               pole hoist dockside, Meadows is seen passing with his 
               secretary and a photographer from the Amity Gazette. A crowd 
               of returning fishermen from the Armada and townspeople are 
               gathering around the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the 
               classic sports fisherman's trophy shot.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Ginny, get this out on the state 
                         wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New 
                         York. Have one of them pick it up 
                         for the national and call Dave Axelrod 
                         in New York and tell him this is 
                         from me and he owes me one... let's 
                         get a picture.

               As he and the photographer turn to mob, we see Hooper and 
               Brody arriving from the morgue. Hooper immediately heads 
               towards the shark, while Brody pauses and we see a look of 
               relief and delight cross his features.

                                     HOOPER
                         Well, if one man can catch a fish in 
                         50 days, then I guess 50 of these 
                         bozos can catch a fish in one day -- 
                         beginner's luck.

                                     BRODY
                              (crossing to men around 
                              shark)
                         You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch 
                         this?

               Men ad lib "No, I caught it..." "I hooked him," etc.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Okay, everybody, I want to get a 
                         picture for the paper -- could 
                         everyone clear out of the way?

               He continues to call directions and move people out of the 
               way to set up his shot. Hooper is measuring the shark.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Could you get out of the shot, young 
                         man?

                                     HOOPER
                         Who, me? Okay...
                              (he drifts off)

               The men (Felix, Pratt, et al) get Brody to join them in the 
               shot. The whole town and the Armada fishermen all line up in 
               a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the 
               victorious fishermen kneeling in front, and the rest of the 
               Armada and Townspeople arranged behind them. Hendricks hold 
               up the "Beach Closed" sign in ironic victory.

               ANGLE SHOWING VAUGHN APPROACHING THE DOCK

               Brody spots the Mayor coming towards the dock, and detaches 
               himself from the group to join him.

                                     BRODY
                         Larry, if you'd see these clowns 
                         leave, you'd never believe they'd 
                         come back with anything. But they 
                         got him!

                                     VAUGHN
                         That's good. That's real good. Ben 
                         Meadows getting pictures for the 
                         paper.

                                     BRODY
                         Sure he is.

               HOOPER AND THE FISHERMEN

               The men who landed the monster are in a tight cluster, 
               debating something with Hooper, who is dwarfed by the big 
               beer bellies and ham-fisted hands all around him. It's 
               probable we don't even see him.

               The Men ad lib "What kind of shark is this?" "It's a shark 
               like in the movies they got sharks." "It's a man-eater, for 
               sure." "I bet it's a record-breaker," etc.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)
                         It's a tiger shark. Very rare in 
                         these waters, and definitely a 
                         maneater.

               Hooper enters the circle, and picks up where he left off, 
               measuring the shark's teeth. Others watch him. Charlie and 
               Denherder walk over to the shark. Charlie punches it.

               BRODY AND VAUGHN

               They are walking down to the shark together.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Who's that young man?

                                     BRODY
                         Matt Hooper, the specialist they 
                         send down from the Oceanographic 
                         Institute.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (speaking to everyone)
                         I think we all owe a debt of gratitude 
                         to these men for catching this 
                         monster.

               Brody and Vaughn are by now near the circle of fishermen, 
               who are surrounding Hooper, raising their voices at him.

                                     PRATT
                         Whadya mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's 
                         that?

                                     GAFFER
                         Teeth are teeth, right?

                                     HOOPER
                         I didn't say this wasn't the shark, 
                         I just said I wasn't sure this was 
                         the one...

                                     BRODY
                         What d'ya mean?

                                     HOOPER
                         There are hundreds of different kinds 
                         of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, 
                         white-tips... any one of them could've 
                         attacked. Look -- shark digestion is 
                         slow. We could open this one up, and 
                         find whatever he's been eating is 
                         still inside.

                                     VAUGHN
                         That's disgusting! This is the 
                         largest, meanest, most vicious shark 
                         ever landed off Amity Island, and a 
                         known maneater!

                                     HOOPER
                         Let's just cut him open and see what's 
                         inside...

                                     BRODY
                         Why not, Larry? We could get a 
                         positive confirmation that way.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't 
                         the time or the place to do some 
                         kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. 
                         Ben...
                              (to Meadows)
                         do you have all the pictures you 
                         need?

                                     MEADOWS
                         Plenty.

                                     HOOPER
                         Wait a minute...

               Felix, Pratt and the others ad lib disagreement. "You're not 
               gonna cut up my trophy," etc.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (seeing something 
                              offstage, with low 
                              intensity)
                         I am not going to stand here and 
                         watch this fish cut open and see 
                         some kid fall out on the dock. 
                         Besides...
                              (he indicates off)

               We see Mrs. Kintner approaching, dressed in black.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Brody)
                         Chief, I'll take responsibility for 
                         this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch 
                         down before he stinks up the whole 
                         island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl 
                         take him out and dump him right in 
                         the drink.

               MRS. KINTNER JOINS THE GROUP

               She seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Chief Brody?

               He nods, she slaps him full across the face. There is an 
               embarrassed silence. Some people leave, following a trend 
               that began with the first mention of cutting open the shark.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         My Alex was a beautiful little boy 
                         and you killed him. Did you know 
                         that? You knew there was a shark out 
                         there. You knew a girl got killed 
                         here last week. I just found that 
                         out. But you knew. You knew it was 
                         dangerous, but you let people go 
                         swimming anyway. You knew all those 
                         things, and still my boy is dead now 
                         and there's nothing you can do about 
                         that. My boy is dead. I wanted you 
                         to know that.

               She stops, unable to continue. Her father takes her arm and 
               leads her away. Pratt, Harry and the others trail off after 
               her. During the rest of the scene, the camera tightens in on 
               Brody to the exclusion of the others.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, 
                         terrible state.

                                     HOOPER
                         Look, maybe this is the wrong time 
                         to pursue this, but I'm not sure...

               Before Hooper can finish, Brody's shoulders slump and he 
               goes slack.

                                     BRODY
                              (almost to himself)
                         She's right.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Let's all get out of here, this place 
                         stinks.

                                     BRODY
                         I'm going home.

               He turns and leaves abruptly, surrendering the dock to Vaughn 
               and Hooper, who eye each other with mutual dis-admiration.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM

               Brody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinner.

               Brody's plate is untouched, a virgin meatloaf. His glass, on 
               the other hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff 
               scotch and ice. He is staring across the table at the 
               youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him. He makes a face 
               back.

               They play this game together for a few minutes.

                                     BRODY
                         C'mere and give Daddy a kiss.

                                     SEAN
                         Why?

                                     BRODY
                         Because he needs it.

               Sean gives Daddy the kiss. Brody shoos him and Michael off 
               to bed. Ellen, who is feeling progressively more left out 
               with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and clears a few 
               dishes. Brody is not letting her into his world for the 
               moment, and it shows. There's a knock at the door.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)
                         Martin Brody residence?

               Ellen opens the door for him.

                                     HOOPER
                         Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband 
                         is here, I'd like to talk to him.

                                     ELLEN
                         So would I. Come on in.

               Hooper enters. He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine 
               which he picked up in town. He sits down near Brody.

                                     ELLEN
                         Would you like something? Some coffee?

                                     HOOPER
                              (seeing Brody's plate)
                         Is anyone having this...?

               He starts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go 
               ahead."

                                     HOOPER
                         Dynamite!
                              (to Brody)
                         How was your day...?

                                     BRODY
                         Swell.

               They exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly 
               desperate, but shared laughter.

                                     HOOPER
                              (producing wine)
                         Here... one red, one white.

               They laugh some more. Ellen is again left out of it.

                                     HOOPER
                              (boning his fish)
                         Ummm. Really good.

               Brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a 
               corkscrew, etc.

                                     ELLEN
                         My husband tells me you're in sharks.

                                     HOOPER
                         I wouldn't put it that way. But I 
                         love sharks.

                                     ELLEN
                         You love sharks?

                                     HOOPER
                         I do.
                              (he tells a story 
                              about his boyhood 
                              and a shark)
                         But you've still got a problem here, 
                         there's a shark just off the island 
                         somewhere.

                                     BRODY
                         How come you have to tell them that?

                                     ELLEN
                         Excuse me, but what are you talking 
                         about? Didn't they catch the shark 
                         this afternoon? It was on the Cape 
                         station news.

                                     HOOPER
                         They caught a shark, not the shark. 
                         Big difference. I could've proved it 
                         this afternoon, by cutting that one 
                         open and examining his stomach 
                         contents. Also, his bite was too 
                         small.

               Brody has the cork out of the wine. Pop.

                                     HOOPER
                         I was lucky to find that in town -- 
                         it's an estate bottled vintage year...

               Brody takes the fine wine, and pours it into his drink glass 
               filling the tumbler to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch, 
               and the wine.

                                     HOOPER
                              (as Brody pours)
                         We ought to let it breathe... 
                         Whatever.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's all have a drink.

               He extends the bottle to Hooper, who politely accepts a token 
               sip. He takes some for himself, and offers some to Ellen.

                                     BRODY
                         You too, sweetheart...

                                     ELLEN

                         Here's to your husband, the only 
                         other rational man on the island. 
                         Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, 
                         and he'll be the only one.

                                     ELLEN
                         You're leaving?

                         Going out on the 'Aurora.'

                                     ELLEN
                         Is that a boat?

                                     HOOPER
                         Is it! The best-funded research 
                         expedition to ever study the shark... 
                         around the world in 18 months.

                                     ELLEN
                         Like those Cousteau specials on 
                         television? I think it's for the 
                         kids, but I love them.

                                     HOOPER
                         Better than Cousteau, or Compagno 
                         with computers, telemetry, Defense 
                         Department funding...

                                     ELLEN
                         I saw a show with sea otters, and a 
                         big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made 
                         me promise to get him one. Will you 
                         live on the boat?

                                     HOOPER
                         Yep.

                         Martin hates boats. Hates the water. 
                         On the ferry to the mainland, he 
                         sits in the car the whole way over. 
                         He's got this childhood thing, there's 
                         a clinical word for it.

                         Drowning. Lemme ask you something. 
                         Is it true most attacks take place 
                         in three feet of water, around 10 
                         feet from the beach?

                                     HOOPER
                         Yeah. Like the kid on your beach.
                         I wish I could've examined that shark 
                         they caught...

                                     BRODY
                         Something else. Do most attacks go 
                         unreported?

                                     HOOPER
                         About half of them. A lot of 'missing 
                         swimmers' are really shark victims.

                                     BRODY
                         There's a kind of a lone shark, 
                         called, uh...

                                     HOOPER
                         Rogue?

                                     BRODY
                         Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where 
                         there's food and hangs out there as 
                         long as the food supply lasts?

                                     HOOPER
                         It's called Territoriality. It's a 
                         theory.

                                     BRODY
                         And before 1900, when people first 
                         starting swimming for recreation, 
                         before public bathing and resorts, 
                         there were very few shark attacks, 
                         cause sharks didn't know what they 
                         were missing?

                                     HOOPER
                         You could say that.

               Brody digests all this; confirmation of facts he has gleaned 
               in his newly acquired knowledge of the shark species.

               There is a long pause.

                                     BRODY
                         Why don't we have one more drink, 
                         you and I, and then we go down and 
                         cut open that old shark and see for 
                         sure what's inside him, or not.

                                     ELLEN
                         Can you do that?

                                     BRODY
                         I am Chief of Police. I can do 
                         anything I want.
                              (to Hooper)
                         You want to come?

                                     HOOPER
                         I'm flattered you should ask.

               He gets up and they both start out. Ellen watches them go.

               INT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT

               Dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange 
               silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding. At one end, the 
               large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a 
               tarp. A single dark figure is bending over the dead shark.

               The large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open, 
               and the Shadowy Figure moves abruptly away from the shark.

               The new entrants move into the shed. It is Hooper and Brody 
               and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car on 
               the way over.

               As the Shadowy Figure moves silently into a vantage point 
               against one wall, he passes through the light from a window; 
               it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize 
               him as he backs against the wall.

                                     HOOPER
                         ...And it was Dartmouth Winter 
                         weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, 
                         and I was her date; then she got 
                         into the fact that her family had 
                         more money than my family, and she 
                         was right -- her great-grandfather 
                         was in mining, and my ancestors were 
                         Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up 
                         and I went home with some beatnik 
                         from Sarah Lawrence.

                                     BRODY
                         What stinks so bad?

                                     HOOPER
                         Our friend, the shark.

               They bend over the shape like 18th century graverobbers.

                                     HOOPER
                         We always had a summer place on the 
                         water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I 
                         figured I'd major in something I 
                         knew about. Oceanography, marine 
                         biology. It was that, or design racing 
                         yachts like my older brother. Hmmm. 
                         He we go. Up the old alimentary canal. 
                         Hold the light.

               We hear a slurp and a squish as Hooper produces a big knife 
               and dips into the shark with a major incision.

                                     HOOPER
                         We open the abdominal cavity and 
                         check the digestive tract. Simple.
                              (he attends to his 
                              work)

               From his vantage point, Quint watches, unseen by the two 
               men.

               Brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex, 
               fascinated by the bizarre ritual.

                                     BRODY
                         What's that?

                                     HOOPER
                         Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap 
                         bag... a paint can... aha!

                                     BRODY
                         What? What?!

                                     HOOPER
                         Just as I thought. He drifted up 
                         here with the Gulf Stream, from 
                         southern waters.

                                     BRODY
                         How can you tell?

                                     HOOPER
                              (showing it)
                         Florida license plate.

                                     BRODY
                         He ate a car?

                                     HOOPER
                              (laughs)
                         No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage 
                         cans of the ocean. They eat anything. 
                         But this one didn't eat any people. 
                         There's nothing here...

               He kicks the remains around below camera.

                                     HOOPER
                         ...Nothing.

                                     BRODY
                         What do we do?

                                     HOOPER
                         If you're looking for a shark, you 
                         don't look on land. You go out and 
                         chum for him.

                                     BRODY
                         Chum?

                                     HOOPER
                         Only one sure way to find him -- 
                         offer him a little something to eat. 
                         Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, 
                         anything. They can sense it miles 
                         away. If he's out there, we might be 
                         able to get a closer look at him.
                              (checks his watch)
                         It's a good time, too. They're night 
                         feeders...

               EXT. ABOARD HOOPER'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

               We see Brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiously 
               as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at 
               night. His glasses are already flecked with the white salt 
               of dried seawater. He is wearing a life-preserver.

               Hooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, his 
               eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and 
               gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding 
               and "fish-finder" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green glow 
               shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-circuit 
               TV cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures onto 
               monitors in the dash.

               In the aisle between the seats is a large container filled 
               with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for signs 
               of shark, and chumming.

                                     HOOPER
                              (indicating distant 
                              flashing beacon)
                         That's the Cape Light -- we're on 
                         the stretch where he's feeding, if 
                         he's still here.

               Brody, bored, tired, and slightly queasy, is trying to 
               concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. He stares 
               at the sophisticated electronics displays.

                                     BRODY
                         What is all this stuff?

                                     HOOPER
                              (ticking them off)
                         Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, 
                         closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- 
                         RDF, single side band...
                              (points to themselves)
                         And two loose nuts behind the wheel.

               Hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time 
               dropping the engines into neutral, and then reverse. The 
               sudden change throws Brody to his knees.

               ANGLE FROM HOOPER'S BOAT: GARDNER'S BOAT "FLICKA" AWASH AND 
               FLOATING DEAD IN THE SEA

               It's what they've just run into -- flooded to the gunwales, 
               loose debris floating around, a tangle of lines and gear 
               looking like floating garbage in the cockpit. Hooper's light 
               sweeps across it.

               Hooper cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampers out to 
               the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flicka.

               INSIDE THE COCKPIT OF HOOPER'S BOAT

               The electronic display is showing increased activity, but 
               only Brody, who is clinging to a support for dear life, can 
               see the blips and hear the chatter. Hooper is leaning out to 
               look at the Flicka.

               Hooper is examining the Flicka, tying a towline to it.

               The light picks its way across the ruined boat. The rail 
               where a cleat once was is broadly scarred down to the raw 
               timber, and the heady cleat has been torn bodily out of the 
               hull, ripped out screws and all.

               death-grip.

               Hooper goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling 
               on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight.

               long, hard look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the

               fascinated by the sea like a bird facing a cobra. He is very

               UNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER

               Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles. Warily he turns a 
               full circle with his hotlight. At first we see nothing out 
               of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low in 
               the water. But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for 
               damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the way 
               forward.

               The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood 
               around it has been bashed and splintered. Hooper explores 
               the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath 
               and begins to dig at something. Whatever it is comes free in 
               his hand. As he studies his find, his light wanders upward, 
               pointing directly into the dark hole. Hooper looks up...

               roar in the ears. His mask fills with water as he flails for 
               the surface. Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his 
               own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with 
               adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried 
               loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the 
               eternity of the ocean bottom. He finally bursts through the 
               surface.

               Brody sinks weakly into a chair. Brody huddles in the stern, 
               Hooper kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a-shiver 
               with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to 
               port.

               Behind the billboard, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn to

                         in the waters around Amity Island, 
                         and that he will continue to feed

                         It happened like this before, in

                         Come here, I want to show you 
                         something.

               He leads Brody around to the front of the billboard, on which 
               we see that some pranksters have painted a huge shark fin in 
               the water behind the swimmer, so she looks now like a frantic 
               bather fleeing a pursuing monster.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a 
                         deliberate mutilation of a public 
                         service message! I want those little 
                         paint-happy bastards caught and hung 
                         up by their baby Buster Browns!

                                     HOOPER
                              (who has followed 
                              them around)
                         That's it! I'm standing here arguing 
                         with a guy who can't wait to be a 
                         hot lunch. Goodbye.

                                     BRODY
                         Wait a minute! I need you.

                                     HOOPER
                         Out there is a Perfect Engine, an 
                         Eating Machine that is a miracle of 
                         evolution -- it swims and eats and 
                         that's all. Look at that! Those 
                         proportions are correct.
                              (indicates fin)
                         I know sharks.

                         You'd love to prove that. Getting 
                         your name in the National Geographic.

                                     BRODY
                         Larry, we can re-open the beaches in 
                         August.

                                     VAUGHN
                         August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, 
                         and we are going to open for business.  
                         It's going to be our best summer in 
                         years. If you're so concerned about 
                         the beaches, you two, you do whatever 
                         you have to to keep them safe, but 
                         with you or without you, the beaches 
                         stay open this weekend.

               INT. FERRY BOAT - DAY

               Two cavernous iron doors. Then a crack of vertical light as 
               six burly crewmen muscle them apart. The Amity ferry landing 
               is approaching, people in colorful outfits waiting dockside 
               for the first filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summer season 
               and --

               Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this 
               wholly visual montage of disembarkation. The next two minutes 
               should be treated like a "short film" taking into account 
               all of the colors, episodes, faces and behavior of a variety 
               of Americans who colonize Eastern resort communities for the 
               ninety-day season.

               Intercut with this montage is Brody's home, where Ellen, 
               Hooper and Brody are in sweaty, gritty all-out effort to 
               enlist some support. Elements in this montage include:

               A.  A train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumper to bumper.

               B.  Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, NYU, wearing 
               knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs, 
               energized children, senior citizens holding hands on the 
               pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchairs.

               C.  Hooper, bent over the phone: "I know it's a long weekend, 
               could you get me his home phone number?

               D.  Sidewalk vendors hawking "Shark Killed" souvenirs, big 
               photo "Personality Posters" of the dead tiger shark hung on 
               the dock.

               E.  Brody: "You're acting senior officer? Where's Chief Petty 
               Officer Feldman? Where's the Coast Guard Executive Officer?"

               F.  Souvenir stands selling Genuine Sharks Teeth from The 
               Amity Killer Shark, Captured This Week.

               G.  Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas lined up with their 
               college student drivers like a bomber wing.

               H.  Hooper:  "Well then, operator, could you try him in the 
               dining room?"

               I.  Brody: "All I get is a recording. Is there some other 
               number I could try...?"

               J.  Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously 
               to the window. Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm, 
               their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years 
               before.

               K.  Hooper: "When did he check out? Did he leave another 
               phone number?"

               L.  Brody: "How can I reach him in Chambers if he's not in 
               Chambers?"

               M.  Little Karate Hands breaking picket fences.

               N.  Some local delinquents about 10 or 12 years old, towing 
               behind their bicycles a little dead sand shark with signs: 
               "Amity Monster Shark." "Killed Here." 5 Cents a Hit." Etc.

               Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend 
               the ramp. They all wear Men's Club Lifeguard patches and 
               matching collegiate windbreakers. They scour the landing, 
               looking for someone to save.

               The boat is empty. Everybody heading inland, anticipating 
               the best Fourth of July ever. Already there is debris on the 
               docks and the cleaning crew works away at it.

               INSIDE THE FERRY

               As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six burly crewmen lean their 
               combined weight against the Cathedral doors, closing out the 
               light and locking in the trade. The doors latch shut with a 
               resounding clang!

               ANGLE ON BRODY, NERVOUSLY WATCHING THE BEACH

               He is studying everything, trying to make sure he has it 
               covered as well as possible. He almost doesn't hear the 
               approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down 
               behind him, and a Flying Officer gets out, starched, pressed 
               fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dark 
               aviator's sunglasses. The Steve Canyon of Amity. He presents 
               Brody with a clipboard.

                                     OFFICER
                         Martin Brody?
                              (Brody nods)
                         I'll need your signature here... 
                         here... and here.

                                     BRODY
                         What is this?

                                     OFFICER
                         Authorization for direct payment of 
                         flight expenses not directly connected 
                         to a normal mission of this command.
                              (Brody doesn't 
                              understand)
                         You pay for the gas.

               Brody signs. The Officer shakes his head as Brody makes an 
               error.

                                     BRODY
                         I signed on the wrong line...

                                     OFFICER
                         Just erase your signature and initial 
                         your erasure.

               Brody complies, shaking his head. The Officer snaps him a 
               salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copter, buckles in, 
               and gives Brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a flurry of 
               sand and ice-cream wrappers.

               EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

               And this is it -- the Dawn Patrol, the only forces that the 
               frantic phone calling produced. Hendricks, and the regular 
               summer extra deputies. The lifeguards. Half a dozen state 
               troopers. Some deputies from neighboring towns, and a Coast 
               Guard ensign with a handful of regulars in work dungarees.

               Some of Hooper's friends from the institute.

               Brody and Hooper, badly in need of sleep, are watching the 
               crew straggle in. Already the first of the holiday beach-
               goers are piling out of their cars in a brightly colored 
               cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, portable bar-b-
               ques, radios, sun visors, reflectors, rafts, balls, tubes, 
               and newspapers.

               Hooper watches one such group: A Family of Ten getting out 
               of a camper-van. He watches in dismay as the family bumbles 
               onto the beach for a day of fun in the sun.

               Brody addresses his troops, such as they are.

                                     BRODY
                         I want to thank you guys from local 
                         agencies for cooperating, and I hope 
                         we won't actually be needing your 
                         services. But I'm glad to have you 
                         here.

               The Men ad lib responses: "Happy to do it," "Any time," 
               "When's lunch?" "I hate holidays," etc.

                                     ENSIGN
                         I want to get our lines and repellent 
                         out, so we better shove off.

               He nods to his men, who head for some Boston Whalers (or 
               similar boat with surf-riding capability) and push off into 
               the surf to patrol the swimming areas.

                                     BRODY
                              (a last caution)
                         We're all on one channel, so let's 
                         keep radio traffic to a minimum, 
                         okay?

               Everyone kind of nods acknowledgment.

                                     HOOPER
                         I hope we get some more help.

                                     BRODY
                         I wish it would rain...

               EXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AREA - CLOSE OF SHARK MACHINE

               In a shed near the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and arcade 
               machines sucking quarters from holiday beach-goers. A 
               mechanical shark traverses the screen, is hit with an electric 
               harpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating a 
               hit.

               Sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. Meadows is 
               there writing it all up for the paper. A move away from the 
               screen of this particular machine reveals the arcade, the 
               parking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panorama of 
               the beach that July 4th has created.

               EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOURTH OF JULY

               four foot surfer's swell curls and crashes on shore, 
               riderless. The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summer color 
               as one thousand vacationers practice fun in the sun, but not 
               in the water. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors are 
               everywhere.

               ANGLE - LIFEGUARD STATIONS

               A half-dozen lookout lofts. As many handsome lifeguards with 
               Walkie-Talkies strapped to their trunks and loud-hailers at 
               arm's reach. Bored, two of the hot dogs train their binoculars 
               on some local color.

               ANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT

               A TV Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to cameras, 
               a camera with a big sports zoom sitting on the platform atop 
               the truck, a spiffy announcer-type in a blazer with his 
               station's call letters on the pocket. Inside the darkened 
               control room, we can see the pale blue squares of monitors 
               in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcher.

               AT SEA

               Hooper is methodically patrolling in his boat. Tactically 
               flanking a three-hundred-yard apron of black repellent are 
               four small watch-boats. A tiny pleasure boat darts around 
               the repellent line. Farther out, crossing back and forth, 
               are patrol boats. To top it all off, a Coast Guard helicopter 
               hovers and patrols three hundred feet above.

               INT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT

               At least eight monitors, reflecting the outputs of three 
               cameras and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and 
               effects monitors.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathers 
               as they unpack their gear, wave to camera, run into the water.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast 
               Guardsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping 
               repellent into the ocean.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Close on the Bandstand, where Amity's 
               band is playing lilting patriotic airs.

               After we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's 
               going on: the preparation of the tape segment for the six 
               o'clock news.

                                     TV DIRECTOR
                         Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2. 
                         1. Roll.

               On the "Tape 1" and "Line" monitors, we see Vaughn being 
               interviewed by the Announcer in the blazer.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         ...and with me is the Mayor of Amity, 
                         Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how 
                         about those rumors?

                                     VAUGHN
                         How about them indeed. I'm pleased 
                         and happy to repeat the news that we 
                         have, in fact, caught and killed a 
                         large predator that supposedly injured 
                         some bathers here. As you can see, 
                         it's a beautiful day, the beaches 
                         are open, and the folks here are 
                         having a wonderful time. Amity, 
                         y'know, means 'Friendship.'

               MONITOR: CAMERA 1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitors, 
               the monitor for Camera 1 pans over to show a Sightseeing Bus 
               pull up in the parking area, and a horde of media vultures 
               spilling out, carrying cameras with long lenses and tripods, 
               telescopes, sunshades and parasols, all the equipment of the 
               curious and none of the equipment of the holiday bather or 
               swimmer.

               TAPE 1 AND LINE MONITORS: Close on the Announcer, Vaughn out 
               of the picture.

                         Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard?

                                     HOOPER
                         What I've heard and what I've seen 
                         are two different things. I believe 
                         there is a large Great White Shark -- 
                         Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters 
                         off this very beach, that he has 
                         killed and that he will kill again...

               Hooper's voice fades off as someone at the mixer panel dials 
               his mike off, and brings up the Announcer's lavalier.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                              (moving into center 
                              frame)
                         And there you have it -- two different 
                         opinions, by men of good will. The 
                         holiday crowd here at Amity seems to 
                         be making up its own mind...

               The camera pans off him to a happy family headed for the 
               beach.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tuba 
               player.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 2: Brody and the Announcer.

               MONITOR: TAPE 1 and LINE: Back on the Announcer, his lips 
               moving, but his sound turned off. We hear, instead, the sound 
               from Monitor Camera 2, Brody and the same Announcer.

                                     BRODY
                         I'm sorry, I just don't have the 
                         time.

                                     TV DIRECTOR
                         Recue the machines. 2, pan off the 
                         Chief and show me some tits and ass. 
                         1, get me some cute kids. 3... see 
                         if you got a shot at the water.

               MONITORS: CAMERAS 1, 2 and 3: The cameras seek out the 
               appropriate activity as the Director calls for it.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                              (holds up stopwatch)
                         Mayor, 43 seconds, Biologist 45 
                         seconds. That's equal time, right?

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Right.
                              (he presses "Talkback" 
                              button to his 
                              announcer)
                         Jerry, come on in and look at this.
                              (to his headset)
                         Roll 2. In five, 4. 3. 2. 1.

               TAPE 2 - MONITOR:

               Starts showing us the assembled interview segment we've just 
               seen, starting with the Announcer's opening remarks.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O. MONITOR)
                         Amity Island is famed for its clear 
                         air and white sand beaches. But a 
                         cloud appeared...

               His voice is dialed under as the Announcer himself appears 
               in the control room to watch himself on the monitors.

                                     ANNOUNCER (LIVE)
                         Look at that shine on my nose. It's 
                         a beacon.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Close enough for remote.

               As Vaughn begins his spiel again, the other monitors show us 
               the action on the beach.

                                     VAUGHN (V.O.)
                         ...I'm pleased and happy...

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Think we ought to stick around?

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         What else you got?

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         Teachers' strike downtown.

                                     CAMERAMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Christenson, this is Al. Union says 
                         time for Engineering Five.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         That's five minutes, guys. Coffee.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               Vaughn is in his shirtsleeves, having slipped out of his 
               jacket.

               He mops his brow, and surveys the beachfront. At this moment, 
               there's nobody swimming. He approaches a familiar Selectman, 
               nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Why don't you get in the water?

                                     SELECTMAN
                         I don't want to wash off my suntan 
                         lotion. I'll get a burn...

                                     VAUGHN
                              (some urgency)
                         Nobody's going in!

               On an adjoining blanket, a spirited Ruth Gordon type is 
               sitting, watching brightly as her manservant, a polished 
               Eric Harrison type, prepares some tea from a thermos.

                                     WOMAN
                         Is there nobody going in? What a 
                         shame. Arthur, should I be going in?

                                     ARTHUR (THE BUTLER)
                              (pouring tea)
                         If you'd like.

               He puts down the tea service, and leads her towards the water.

               At the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (as he enters the 
                              waves)
                         It's very nice. Not too cold... Quite 
                         refreshing... Very pleasant....

               He ducks his head under for a final look around. His dripping 
               head rises triumphantly from the surf.

                                     ARTHUR
                         No sharks, m'lady.

               She starts into the water, he takes her parasol, escorting 
               her the rest of the way into the ocean.

                                     WOMAN
                         This is marvelous! Arthur, I want to 
                         come back to this very spot. Will 
                         you make a note of where we are?

               WIDE - ON THE BEACH

               Encouraged by the sight of the Woman and Arthur, and Vaughn's 
               quiet urgings, people begin to wander into the surf, a few 
               at first, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin 
               enjoying the pleasures of ocean bathing. The Selectman goes 
               in, his family follows, Vaughn watches it all, beaming.

               BOAT #7

               Hendricks is on the radio while a Coast Guard spotter works 
               the sonar.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. 
                         Over.

               Pan to the water.

               UNDERWATER

               As before, 400 pairs of enticing, yummy swimmers' legs, 
               kicking like animated hors d'oeuvres.

               INT. HELICOPTER - AERIAL VIEW

               A breathtaking view. The copter spotter looks down with naked 
               eye and binoculars.

                                     COPTER SPOTTER
                         Nothing from up here, Daisy. Over.

               CLOSE - HENDRICKS

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         False alarm. Must be this glare.

               ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY

               He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the 
               happy hordes. Meadows nods "hello."

                                     VOICES
                         Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up 
                         to your knees, yeah -- So come with 
                         me -- I'll go again.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Beautiful day, Chief!

               A group of youngsters playing with Michael Brody's dinghy.

               They are hauling it toward the surf.

                                     BRODY
                         Hey Mikey -- !

               Michael turns as Brody trots toward him.

                                     BRODY
                         You're not going to the ocean with 
                         that, are you son?

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm all checked out for light surf 
                         and look at it.

                                     BRODY
                         Do me this favor just once. Use the 
                         ponds.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.

                                     BRODY
                         Just a favor for your old man.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (confused)
                         Sure, Dad.

               TV CREW - NEAR WATER

               TV cameramen are packing up their gear. For them it's a wrap

               REPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN

               Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copter Spotter's 
               voice overloads the speaker.

                                     COPTER SPOTTER
                         Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four!

               BOAT #7 - HENDRICKS

               Guns are up, heads turning everywhere.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         Where -- ?

                                     COPTER SPOTTER
                         Went under your -- There!

               The Coast Guard sonar operator spots it and pales. A slick 
               black dorsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming area.

                                     SONAR OPERATOR
                         Jesus Christ -- Shark!

               BEACH - BRODY

               Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying 
               to transmit.

                                     BRODY
                         Everybody out! Out of the water, 
                         please -- leave the water, please --

               A lifeguard in a loft behind him begins blowing on his 
               whistle.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               shouting hysterically.

                                     BRODY
                         No whistles! No whistles!

               THE BEACH

               Dozens of bathers halfway out of the water, turn to see. 
               More whistles, and they start toward shore. We hear panicky 
               voices ad-libbing; "Shark," "Look Out," etc. The loudhailers 
               sounding more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one 
               person after another. Entire groups of people begin pulling 
               toward shore, some of them obviously trying to control a 
               growing hysteria in others.

               BOATS #6 AND #7

               are converging, heading toward the repellent line as if 
               tracking an underwater shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent 
               cordons and heading into the crowds.

               HOOPER'S BOAT

               Caught on the other end of the line, he is wheeling in a 
               broad, hot-dogger's circle turn, headed back.

               THE WATER - BATHERS

               People begin screaming. Kids are suddenly separated from 
               their parents. Others seem to forget how to swim. One myopic 
               little girl has her glasses bumped off and she begins to cry 
               in blinded panic. Ellen Brody looks around frantic.

               BOATS #2, #3, #4

               The riflemen in the boats are trying to get a bead, but too 
               many civilians create a hazard. The Coast Guardsmen attempt 
               to sever the repellent cord to gain access to the bathing 
               area and the heaving fin.

               THE WATER - BATHERS

               This is a confirmation of our worst dread -- a full-blown 
               headlong water panic. Screaming vacationers claw their way 
               over the bodies of the less able. Some literally attempt to 
               walk over the bobbing heads and glistening backs of others 
               pulling for dry land.

               CLOSEUPS - PANIC

               Horrified faces. Some are stunned and wandering in slow, 
               tentative circles, while others are helped out by friends.

               Five people try to mount a rubber raft.

               Ugly reminders that each of us is Number One.

               Brody enters shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone 
               charges past him to help an old man out of the water.

               EXT. THE BEACH

               Dragging the helpless from the surf. Tears well in Brody's 
               eyes. The screaming is deafening. The TV unit is hopping up 
               and down in rage and frustration.

                                     TV DIRECTOR
                         Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody 
                         get that!

               One thousand survivors pack the beach, standing absolutely 
               still. A numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against 
               each other.

               Muted sobs, whimpering, coughing.

               The six burly lifeguards huddle together like Cub Scouts.

               ANGLE - BATHING AREA

               The monstrous black fin turns a slow circle as two Coast 
               Guardsmen manage to cut their own repellent line. All boats 
               converge on the dynamic fin. Men raise their guns to fire. 
               Others adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated 
               fashion.

               CLOSE - FIN

               It slips sideways, revealing for the first time a tiny blue 
               snorkel. Then appears the faces of two youngsters whom we 
               will recall from the coven behind the dune. The fin bobs 
               back, a beaverboard replica attached to a partially submerged 
               surfboard. One youngster looks up and is greeted by:

               YOUNGSTER'S POINT OF VIEW

               Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed directly at him. 
               Surrounding him on three sides. Some of the policemen start 
               to lower their guns -- struck dumb.

               HOOPER IN HIS BOAT

               He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his 
               eyes still restlessly searching.

               CLOSE - YOUNGSTER

               his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his 
               hands in unconditional surrender.

               ANGLE - ESTUARY

               The narrow estuary leading into the half-mile is rough today.

               Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach 
               panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little girl 
               points.

               BLACK DORSAL FIN

               is cruising through the narrows and toward the busy pond.

               HOOPER IN HIS BOAT AGAIN

               He sees it, and jams his throttle forward. He steers with 
               one hand, fumbling urgently for his walkie-talkie with the 
               other.

               AERIAL VIEW

               The circle of boats around the little pranksters, the crowds 
               huddled on the beach, Hooper's boat suddenly arrowing towards 
               the estuary, leaving a huge boiling wake.

               CLOSE ON VAUGHN

               He catches Hooper's boat out of the corner of his eye. 
               Curious, he follows its progress. It's urgency finally 
               communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot 
               across the dunes towards a rise overlooking the estuary.

               OVERLOOKING THE ESTUARY

               Vaughn gets there just in time to see the disaster. He 
               watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath. Stunned.

               ANGLE - POND

               Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit.

               Kit is admiring the shark's tooth necklace around his own 
               neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by 
               it.

               The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They are 
               not yet aware. The fin seems to circle and return. It heads 
               toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its 
               way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of coffee 
               when he is "bumped." The entire boat is overturned. Michael 
               sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow 
               lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side.

               Michael and Kit are thrown head first.

               Three heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between 
               them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes directly 
               at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could 
               touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and 
               panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That 
               all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream -- 
               the head and upper torso of the novice passing Michael swiftly 
               as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing 
               behind.

                                     THE VICTIM
                              (passing a horrified 
                              Michael, who half 
                              extends one hand, as 
                              if to help)
                         It's no good. I'm dead...
                              (and he is)

               A renewed cry of shark!

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He turns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand.

               CLOSE - ELLEN

               A sudden turn. She runs.

               CLOSE - HOOPER IN BOAT

               He's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                                     HOOPER
                         Block the estuary! The estuary!

               Three boats racing to carry out the orders. The black fin re-
               passing the two children, racing to get out. Hooper reaches 
               the mouth before the others. The fin won't veer off. It smacks 
               into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left 
               racing into open water. Blood leavings. Hooper leaping over 
               the side, slogging towards Michael.

               WIDE ON WATER

               Copter roars in buzzing the shark, but too late.

               CLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN

               They are pulling Michael out of the water as Hooper splashes 
               up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at 
               nothing.

                                     BRODY
                              (feeling his face)
                         He's in shock. Get blankets!

               People gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of their 
               hands. They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet 
               raised above his head.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Michael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen are there.

               Sean is sleepy in Brody's arms. Vaughn is waiting in the 
               hall.

                                     NURSE
                         The doctor said it's okay -- mild 
                         shock. He can come home in the 
                         morning.

                                     ELLEN

                         Hey, big guy -- you want anything 
                         from home?

                         Take him home.

                         No. Home here.

               Ellen exits.

                                     BRODY
                              (crossing to Vaughn)
                         Got a pen on you?

                         Why?

                                     BRODY
                         There's only one thing you're good 
                         for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. 
                         Here. It's an authorization to employ 
                         a contractor.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I don't know if I can do that without 
                         a...

                                     BRODY
                              (interrupting)
                         I'm going to hire Quint to kill the 
                         fish. I want to see that shark dead.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Maybe we can save August...

                                     BRODY
                         Forget it. This summer's had it.
                         Next summer's had it. You're the 
                         mayor of Shark City. You wanted to 
                         keep the beaches open. What happens 
                         when the town finds out about that?

                                     VAUGHN
                         I was acting in the town's best 
                         interests...

                                     BRODY
                         The best interest in this town would 
                         be to see that fish belly-up in the 
                         water with a hole in his head. You 
                         do the right thing. You authorize 
                         me.
                              (indicates paper)
                         Right there. Whatever it costs.

                                     VAUGHN
                         My kids were on that beach...

                                     BRODY
                         Just sign it, Larry.

               Vaughn signs, and Brody takes the paper and exits.

               QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY

               Brody and Hooper are approaching Quint's house. They enter 
               through the big wooden doors, into another circle of Hell.

               Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting over fires 
               fills the air. Quint and his mate, Herschel, are grinding 
               pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on 
               the floor, its ruined carcass adding to the stench of other 
               sharks being boiled in the drums, their tails suspended in 
               the air.

               Diesel fumes and decay fill the air, and tools, ropes, broken 
               bits of iron and engine parts litter the floor. Wall hangings 
               of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear all 
               conspire to frame the killing floor.

               Brody and Hooper navigate the obstacle course.

                                     BRODY
                         This has got to be one big 
                         violation...

                                     HOOPER
                              (handling some gear)
                         This is quite a place.

                                     QUINT'S VOICE
                         Keep your hands off my stuff.

               He emerges from the steam and smoke.

                                     QUINT
                         Did you bring a check?

                         What?

                                     QUINT
                         Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake 
                         and a promise?

                                     BRODY
                         I'm authorized by the township of 
                         Amity to hire you as an independent 
                         contractor. We'll meet your price.

                         And my regular daily rate -- $200, 
                         whether we catch him or not.

                                     BRODY
                         You got it.

                                     QUINT
                         And incidental damages, if any...

                                     BRODY
                         You got it.

                         And you get the Mayor off my back 
                         with this zoning crap. Nobody tells 
                         me how to run my property.

                                     BRODY
                         You got it.

                                     QUINT
                         And, uh, a case of apricot brandy 
                         and you buy the lunch.

                                     BRODY
                         Two cases. And dinner when you land.

                                     QUINT
                              (pours drink)
                         Try some of this. I made it myself.

               Brody tastes.

                                     QUINT
                         Here's to swimmin' with bowlegged 
                         women.

               Herschel interrupts. He's stopped working, and is wiping his 
               hands on a bloody rag.

                                     HERSCHEL
                         Mr. Quint...

               Quint wheels to face him.

                                     HERSCHEL
                         I'm not goin'. No sir.

                                     QUINT
                         You want to get paid, you go.

                                     HERSCHEL
                         Forget the money. You can't pay me 
                         enough. I ain't crazy. I worked some 
                         big mean fish with you, but I ain't 
                         goin' on this one.

                                     QUINT
                         This is the last time I hear from 
                         you. I don't want anyone with piss

                         and top off the fuel tanks, and finish 
                         up in the morning. Then you're on 
                         the beach.

               Quint turns to see this new voice, and starts walking towards 
               him.

                         pleasure boating. I'm talking about 
                         working for a living. Sharking.

               Hooper ties the knot effortlessly.

               He takes Hooper's hands in his own big bloody fists, and 
               feels them as he talks.

                         comes Mr. White, and makes it look 
                         like a kiddy scissors class has gone 
                         to work on it and made paper dolls.

               a wagon behind him are two long-haired Research Assistants 
               from the Institute. On the wagon, among other things, is a 
               big shark cage. At dockside, Hooper checks his list, as he 
               signs for his issue.

               Brody nods, and holds her hand for a wordless moment.

               Its diesels chugging, the Orca pulls away from the pier.

               Ellen has already resolutely turned her back on it, and is 
               walking off the dock back onto dry land.

               ABOARD THE ORCA

               Quint has set a course out towards the open sea. He lashes 
               the wheel, and jumps down to address Hooper and Brody, who 
               are standing together in the stern.

                         I'll throw your ass through that 
                         little round window.

               He laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells 
               all his charters.

                         fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her 
                         Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner. 
                         You'll jump when I holler. We're 
                         doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't

                         Cross me, and I'll slap you upside 
                         your heads. Now -- if you boys are 
                         ready -- let's go fishin'.

               He starts moving gear around, preparing chum barrels, setting 
               hooks, Hooper gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON

               It is quiet as the Orca drifts along in the current, a wide 
               chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread 
               along our perspective show us the miles the boat has gone.

               Quint spots something in the water -- a small blue shark 
               attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of 
               bait, and throws it over the side.

                         Here's something for you...

               The shark takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently 
               sets the hook, and reels the shark alongside. He hauls it 
               part way out of the water, and sticks it with a gaff. Hooper 
               and Brody watch.

               INSERT - SHARK WRIGGLING ON HOOK

               Tailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shark is 
               immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his 
               big knives and poses for a moment beside the struggling fish.

                                     QUINT
                         These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat 
                         their own guts.

               He slices into the shark's underbelly. We hear the sound of 
               entrails plopping into the water. Brody is almost retching, 
               and Hooper is just displeased.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               The gutted shark swimming in circles biting at its own 
               entrails.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Fins closing in on the wounded shark.

                         Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em 
                         where you got it!

               SHARK FRENZY

               A boil of water and the flash of fins and teeth as the local 
               sharks erupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood 
               spewing, a sudden display of the fury and blind predatory 
               drive of the fearsome species.

                         What's that supposed to prove?

                         Just a little appetizer. I want our 
                         porker to know we're serving. I want 
                         to put some iron into that big yap...

               HOOPER AND BRODY REACT AS WE

               EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTERNOON

               The Orca is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin, 
               the sun sucking heat waves from its surface. Brody at the 
               stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further 
               sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt:  
               the ladling out of chum. There are several empty chum barrels. 
               A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to 
               be tossed over the side. Brody is reeling with nausea. He 
               opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and 
               some Old Spice after-shave. He pours the after-shave into 
               the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hooper is also in the 
               stern.

                         Keep that chum line going -- we've 
                         got five good miles. Don't break it.

                                     BRODY
                         Who's driving the boat?

                                     QUINT
                         Nobody. We're drifting with the 
                         current.

                                     HOOPER
                              (using the fish finder)
                         Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Hell, in the old days we went out 
                         with good charts, good sounding lead, 
                         and a damn good compass. Nowadays, 
                         these kids are afraid to go out 
                         without depth finders, radar, radio, 
                         electric toothbrush, every stupid 
                         thing...

               Quint opens a can of beer and drains it in one long pull, 
               crushing the empty and throwing it over the side. Hooper 
               drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his 
               hand with a silly "plup." He stows the pieces in an empty 
               chum barrel.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Get a fresh barrel.

               Brody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figure out 
               the knots. He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all 
               comes loose... barrel, shark cage, and, most important, 
               Hooper's tanks, clattering and rolling on the deck.

                         Real fine stuff but it won't mean a 
                         thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he 
                         didn't go to schools in electronics. 
                         He was born with what he does best. 
                         Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course 
                         he might eat this stuff, but then 
                         I've seen him eat a rocking chair, 
                         too.

               LATER

               The men are in different positions on the boat. Hooper on 
               the flying bridge. Quint in the stern, Brody hanging over 
               the rail, puking.

               Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnarled 
               squid from the garbage pail, and searches for a No. 2 hook 
               rig. He holds up a strip of whale.

                         The expert don't approve. What do 
                         you thing? You're closer to the 
                         situation.
                              (laughs)

               Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.

                              (croaky)
                         Why are we way out here, when the 
                         shark's back there?

                              (to himself)
                         Easy for you -- they got a brain the 
                         size of a radish.

               Quint sits in the fighting chair. He casts off, murmuring as 
               the line feeds out.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Now if he weren't around, we'd of 
                         hooked something else by now, wouldn't 
                         we? But he scared 'em all away. Big

               Quint at ease in his chair, Brody near him, practicing tying 
               knots. The line starts to move, a few feet at a time; both 
               men watch. Then the line whizzes off the reel. Brody jumps 
               up. Hooper springs to the deck. Quint puts his hand on the 
               drag and addresses the situation softly.

                         Hooooooo!

               Quint tightens drag and strikes. The line goes whizzing out.

               Brody runs to Quint's side. Hooper springs up to the flying 
               bridge.

                                     BRODY

                         Wet my reel, quick!

               Brody goes to get water, the boat surges, he staggers. Brody 
               pours water on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now.

               Hooper is turning the boat around and the line changes 
               direction.

               He ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes 
               out and there is less tension. Quint is horsing up and down, 
               reeling in.

               The line is almost vertical, and Quint shows a hint of 
               bafflement. He reels in suspiciously.

               The leaders show above the water line. Brody is wide-eyed,

               Before he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily 
               clutching at the big rod, appalled. Quint skips away for a 
               flying gaff. He picks one, turns...

               That's when the leader lashes free, sending Hooper crashing 
               backward in a serious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's 
               forehead, drawing blood. Quint snatches up the rod and reels 
               in.

               The wires have been bitten through.

                                     QUINT

                         A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't 
                         ever tell me my business again. Get 
                         back up on the bridge.

                                     HOOPER
                              (stunned)

                         Don't tell me my business!
                              (to Hooper, points)
                         Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.

               Hooper shakes off his dizziness and obeys. Brody watches 
               Quint rig up a new leader, hook up the same bait.

                                     BRODY

                         How -- if they're gonna keep on

                         What I do is trick him to the surface, 
                         got that? Then I can jab him, 
                         understand?

                         Think I'm gonna haul it in as if 
                         he's a catfish, like everyone else 
                         does?

               Brody goes inside to inspect his forehead.

               ON BRIDGE - HOOPER AND QUINT

                                     QUINT
                              (suddenly, pointing)

                         What do you see?

                              (still looking)
                         At least you handle the boat all 
                         right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.

               Hooper cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down. He stands 
               stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent.

               Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it 
               over to the chair. About to sit down, he freezes.

               CLOSE - QUINT

               looking hard at something.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               staring, eyes widening.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               moving in, surprised, interested, fascinated.

               THEIR COMBINED POINT OF VIEW

               We see the shark. First the fin... then the head and upper 
               jaws, ten or twenty yards off the side of the boat. It finally 
               submerges, its tail giving a final slap.

               ANGLE ON QUINT

               He puts his rod away and stares at it. And stares. And stares.

               Hooper is the first to break the silence.

                                     HOOPER
                         20 feet, if it's an inch...

                                     QUINT
                         25 feet. And three tons of him there.

               Hooper is nearly beside himself with a strange ecstasy. He 
               leaps toward his gear.

                                     QUINT
                              (quietly, to Brody)
                         I never saw one that big.

                                     BRODY
                         What do we do? Get some help? Radio 
                         in?

               Quint ignores him and moves off into the pilot house, where 
               he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin 
               to assemble something inside it. Brody is alone on the deck 
               with Hooper.

                                     BRODY
                         How're we gonna handle this?

               Hooper is contained in his own excitement. He has finally 
               come up with what he was looking for -- an expensive Nikon 
               through which he peers intently at the shark alongside. He 
               is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range finder 
               and focus.

               He is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional 
               boil.

                                     HOOPER
                              (very, very high)
                         There's a formula! Girth, about 150 
                         inches, squared, divide by 800 -- 
                         son of a bitch, they are not going 
                         to believe this! -- divide by 2000... 
                         three tons!
                              (after Quint)
                         You're right, you old fart! Three 
                         tons!
                              (ad libs ecstasy)

               CLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE

               He is assembling the Greener harpoon gun, deftly screwing on 
               the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft 
               with the wicked barbs, the frame all rigged with line. Past 
               him, on the deck, we can still see Hooper. As Quint is working 
               with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.

                                     RADIO VOICE (V.O.)

                         to Orca...

               Quint snaps the mouthpiece to his lips.

                         I just wanted to know if you were 
                         all right... the Coast Guard let me 
                         use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?

                                     QUINT
                         He's busy.

                                     ELLEN'S VOICE
                         Well... is everything all right?

                                     QUINT
                         Just fine, Missus. We'll be back 
                         soon. Everything's fine. We haven't 
                         seen anything yet. Orca out.

               He snaps off the radio, and, for good measure, pulls the 
               plug from the power source.

               ANGLE FROM DECK

               The big shark is slicing through the water just below the 
               surface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the 
               teeth gleaming.

               ANGLE - INCLUDING FOREDECK

                                     HOOPER
                              (on deck)
                         Damn it! I need something in the 
                         foreground to give it some scale. 
                         Martin! Stand here! No, to your left!

               He is positioning Martin frantically, trying to include Brody, 
               the shark, and the Orca in the same frame. Quint finishes 
               with the gun, and as a final gesture, snaps an explosive 
               cartridge into the breech. He empties the box of cartridges 
               onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them 
               into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound for the bow 
               pulpit.

               ON DECK

               Quint appears with the harpoon gun. He throws one end of the 
               line to Hooper.

                                     QUINT
                         Here. Rig this to the forward keg up 
                         there.

               He indicates the barrels on the foredeck.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Get up there and steer her. Follow 
                         my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've 
                         got to get a clean shot at that 
                         porker's head.

               Quint moves up toward the bow, Brody goes up to the flying 
               bridge to take the wheel, Hooper starts for the foredeck, 
               but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as he 
               desperately hunts for something.

                                     QUINT
                         Hurry up, rig the line!

               ANGLE ON HOOPER

               He finds what he's looking for. A small, powerful strobe 
               unit, waterproofed, a miniature signal beacon. He triggers 
               it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in 
               the sun.

               Hooper scampers to the foredeck and begins to rig the light 
               to the first barrel, as the shark begins to surface near the 
               bow.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady 
                         now...

               He guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries urgently to 
               get it right, not to oversteer, to try to hold the big boat 
               with its throbbing diesels on the course that Quint is 
               indicating.

                                     QUINT
                         The line, man, the line!

               Hooper is rigging like crazy.

               FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

               Brody steering f.g., Hooper on the foredeck with the barrels, 
               Quint leaning out over the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the 
               shark crossing inexorably in front of them.

               CLOSE ON QUINT

               Agonizing over his shot as the shark approaches, glancing 
               back to see if the line is properly rigged and Hooper is 
               clear of it.

                                     QUINT
                         Get clear, damn you!

               The shark is in position, Hooper shouts, a moment too late.

                                     HOOPER
                         Clear!

               Quint fires. The harpoon slams into the shark behind his 
               head, half-way along the back in front of the big dorsal 
               fin.

                                     QUINT
                         Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!

               INSERT - COILED ROPE AND BARREL

               The rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion, Hooper jumps 
               back, and the barrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the 
               line rigged to the harpoon. It bounds forward and into the 
               sea, past Quint, who is already reloading, mounting another 
               steel shaft. In the distance, the barrel bobs and skips 
               violently in the water, dragged by the shark in his merciless 
               moves.

               THE FOREDECK - QUINT

                                     QUINT
                         Now you've done it, you piss-ant. 
                         Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to 
                         my gear. Let the bastard fight the 
                         keg for a while. He can't stay down 
                         with that on.

               Hooper, furious with himself, runs for the flying bridge to 
               take the helm from Brody.

               THE FLYING BRIDGE, BRODY AND HOOPER

               Hooper has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle 
               forward as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree turn.

                                     HOOPER
                              (to Quint)
                         Rig another keg! I'm bringing her 
                         around!

               His eyes dart about the ocean, looking for the barrel, as he 
               hot-dogs the ship around in a violent expression of his own 
               disgust with himself.

                                     HOOPER
                              (to himself)
                         God damn it! We had him!
                              (to Quint)
                         I'm coming about!

               He spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle 
               like a formula speedster. The decks tip and the rigging sways 
               under the sudden strain. Brody is caught unaware, and tumbles 
               off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against a 
               wall. the M1 Rifle is close to his hand. He stares at it.

               FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

               Hooper is anguished, intense, trying to find the shark, 
               spinning the wheel, compounding his error, tipping the boat 
               in rolling turns as he crosses his own wake. Quint has turned 
               his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at 
               Hooper, staring at him, excluding everything else.

               As Quint folds his arms and stares at Hooper, we realize the 
               sun is going down, and it's getting dark.

                                     BRODY
                         Why don't we go in? Get another crack 
                         at him tomorrow.

                                     QUINT
                         We got a barrel on him. We can't 
                         lose him. We stay out here until we 
                         find him.

               Hooper throttles back, and the roar of the diesels subsides 
               and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly circling the ocean.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's call in -- we can radio and 
                         have a big boat here in an hour...

                                     QUINT
                              (grim)
                         You hired me, remember? It's my 
                         $10,000. It's my shark...

               EXT. ORCA - OPEN SEA - NIGHT

               Throttled back to slow ahead, the boat circles the water 
               endlessly, staying over the shark like an avenging angel. 
               Its running lights gleam in the night, and a glow lights the 
               interior of the pilot house. A bright strobe glints on the 
               water winking once like a firefly.

               INT. PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

               Brody and Hooper at the table, Quint at the wheel, keeping 
               his eye on the light.

                                     QUINT
                         He's up again.

               He corrects course slightly to keep the barrel buoy in sight.

               Hooper is sitting at the table, morose. Brody is staring at 
               a couple of open cans of beans or beef stew, or some other 
               crappy rations Quint has on board. Dirty spoons stuck in the 
               open cans show us this has not been a formal dinner. Quint 
               fumbles on the chart shelf and produces some of his home 
               brew.

               He takes a pull, and hands it to Hooper, who takes a double.

               Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his forehead, where the 
               fishing rod caught him.

               Quint bends forward and pulls his hair aside to show something 
               near the crown.

                                     QUINT
                         That's not so bad. Look at this: 
                         ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, 
                         in Boston, where some sunovabitch 
                         winged me upside the head with a 
                         spittoon.

               Brody looks politely. Hooper stirs himself.

                         Steve Kaplan bit me during recess.

               Quint is amused. He presents his own formidable forearm.

                         Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay

                         suit.

               Brody is fascinated. Quint and Hooper take a long pull from 
               the bottle.

               He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scar.

                         a nutmeg grater...

               Brody is drawn into their boasting comparisons. He secretly 
               checks his own appendix scar, decides not to enter the 
               contest.

                                     HOOPER

                         And I'll drink to yours.

               They toast each other. Brody looks around, sees the strobe 
               blink once through the darkened window.

                                     QUINT

                         Just look. Don't touch...

               He starts lowering his pants to reveal a place on one hip 
               where the tissue is scarred and irregular.

               Hooper is pulling at his shirt, trying to get it off, but 
               it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone.

                         Gimme a hand, here. I got something

               Brody lends a hand. The shirt slips part way off.

               The two men raise their mugs in a toast.

               He drinks, Hooper follows.

                         Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis.
                         June 29th, 1945, three and a half 
                         minutes past midnight, two torpedoes 
                         from a Japanese submarine slammed 
                         into our side. Two or three. We was 
                         still under sealed orders after 
                         deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima 
                         bomb...we was goin' back across the 
                         Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn 
                         near eleven hundred men went over 
                         the side. The life boats was lashed 
                         down so tight to make the bomb run 
                         we couldn't cut a single one adrift. 
                         Not one. And there was no rafts. 
                         None. That vessel sank in twelve 
                         minutes. Yes, that's all she took. 
                         We didn't see the first shark till 
                         we'd been in the water about an hour. 
                         A thirteen-footer near enough. A 
                         blue. You measure that by judgin' 
                         the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't 
                         know... of course the Captain knew...I 
                         guess some officers knew... was the 
                         bomb mission had been so secret, no 
                         distress signals was sent. What the 
                         men didn't know was that they wouldn't 
                         even list us as overdue for a week. 
                         Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't 
                         an officer -- just as well perhaps. 
                         So some of us were dead already -- 
                         in the water -- just hangin' limp in 
                         our lifejackets. And several already 
                         bleedin'. And the three hundred or 
                         so laying on the bottom of the ocean. 
                         As the light went, the sharks came 
                         crusin'. We formed tight groups -- 
                         somewhat like squares in an old battle -- 
                         You know what I mean -- so that when 
                         one come close, the man nearest would 
                         yell and shout and pound the water 
                         and sometimes it worked and the fish 
                         turned away, but other times that 
                         shark would seem to look right at a 
                         man -- right into his eyes -- and in 
                         spite of all shoutin' and poundin' 
                         you'd hear that terrible high 
                         screamin' and the ocean would go 
                         red, then churn up as they ripped 
                         him.  Then we'd reform our little 
                         squares. By the first dawn the sharks 
                         had taken more than a hundred. Hard 
                         for me to count but more than a 
                         hundred. I don't know how many sharks. 
                         Maybe a thousand. I do know they 
                         averaged six men an hour. All kinds -- 
                         blues, makos, tigers. All kinds.
                              (Pause)
                         In the middle of the second day, 
                         some of us started to go crazy from 
                         the thirst. One fella cried out he 
                         saw a river, another claimed he saw 
                         a waterfall, some started to drink 
                         the ocean and choked on it, and some 
                         left our little groups -- our little 
                         squares -- and swam off alone lookin' 
                         for islands and the sharks always 
                         took them right away. It was mainly 
                         the young fellas that did that -- 
                         the older ones stayed where they 
                         was. That second day -- my life jacket 
                         rubbed me raw and that was more blood 
                         in the water. Oh my. On Thursday 
                         morning I bumped up against a friend 
                         of mine -- Herbie Robinson from 
                         Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it 
                         seemed he was asleep but when I 
                         reached over to waken him, he bobbed 
                         in the water and I saw his body upend 
                         because he'd been bitten in half 
                         beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it 
                         went on -- bombers high overhead but 
                         nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides, 
                         sharks, and all this goin' crazy and 
                         dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day, 
                         Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung 
                         around and came in low. Yes. He did 
                         that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And 
                         early evenin', a big fat PBY come 
                         down out of the sky and began the 
                         pickup.  That was when I was most 
                         frightened of all -- while I was 
                         waitin' for my turn. Just two and a 
                         half hours short of five days and 
                         five nights when they got to me and 
                         took me up. Eleven hundred of us 
                         went into that ocean -- three hundred 
                         and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen 
                         hundred and forty five. June the 
                         29th.
                              (pause)
                         Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

               EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

               Quint has just finished his story, and we are looking across 
               the quiet night sea to the Orca slowly circling in the night, 
               the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the figures 
               of the three men inside, the red and green running lights 
               winking along the ship's flanks. We hear the distant boom 
               and drawn-out hoot of a whale.

               INT. ORCA PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     BRODY
                         What the hell?

                                     HOOPER
                         It's a whale out there.

               There's a brief, eerie pause. Quint breaks the silence by 
               muttering into song, which he slowly swells.

                                     QUINT
                              (singing)
                         Show me the way to go home... I'm 
                         tired and I want to go to bed. I had 
                         a little drink about an hour ago, 
                         and it went right to my head.
                              (etc.)

               Gradually, Hooper and Brody join in, and the pilothouse 
               becomes a warm cozy place.

               EXT. OCEAN

               The Orca and its song in the night. In the foreground, the 
               barrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them, 
               the big dorsal fin surfaces, and glides ominously towards 
               the ship.

               INT. PILOT HOUSE

               The song is continuing, and we hear the barest hint of a 
               scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. Quint's 
               eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the first to 
               hear the abrasion of his ship. Things vibrate on the shelves.

               Quint stops singing, Hooper and Brody continue a duet. The 
               scraping repeats, and Hooper now senses it. He drops out of 
               the song, leaving Brody singing solo.

                                     QUINT
                              (quietly, to Hooper)
                         Start the engines.

               As Brody hears this and is about to stop singing, the boat 
               is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping turns 
               to a violent assault somewhere on the understructure of the 
               vessel. Water bubbles up into the hold. Brody starts, and 
               looks at the radio. He is about to move towards it when 
               Quint's urgent instructions stop him.

                                     QUINT
                         He's busting the shaft! Start the 
                         pump!

                                     BRODY
                         Where...?

                                     QUINT
                         The bilge pumps. There --

               He leaves Brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck, 
               grabbing his M-1 rifle as he goes. Brody hits a switch and 
               we hear the pumps starting.

               ANGLE ON THE ORCA

               Hooper is on the flybridge, starting the engines, but the 
               diesels sound wrong.

                                     QUINT
                         Cut the engines!

               Hooper does.

                                     HOOPER
                         Rudder bearings?

               The boat is assaulted again. Quint fires over the stern, 
               emptying a clip into the water.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Get up forward! Watch for him!

               Brody moves cautiously up to the bow.

                                     QUINT
                         Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hooper!

               Hooper stands ready on the bridge, Quint pacing the stern 
               deck.

                                     QUINT
                         Nobody sleeps! Nobody.

               He jams a fresh clip into the M-1. The men scan the seas 
               around them. Quint resumes their song, louder this time, 
               more defiant.

                                     QUINT
                              (sings)
                         Show me the way to go home... I'm 
                         tired and I want to go to bed.
                              (etc.)

               Hooper and Brody join in from their respective positions.

               EXT. OCEAN, WIDE ON THE ORCA

               The men in place, singing, the water sparkling towards the 
               horizon, the stars twinkling above. The sound of a distant 
               whale in distant counterpoint.

               EXT. THE ORCA - DAWN

               Brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while Hooper and 
               Quint have a hatch up on the stern, and are working together 
               to repair the damaged rudder controls torn loose by the shark. 
               Hooper is bucking the steel rod, while Quint is hammering 
               away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin.

               The engine is idling. Bits of iron clutter the deck, along 
               with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.

                                     QUINT
                         More left rudder! More! Left hand 
                         down now, Chief.

               Brody tries to comply.

                                     HOOPER
                              (shifting his grip)
                         Lemme get a better angle on it. Now.

               Quint hammers again.

                                     QUINT
                         He's bent the housing. You can hear 
                         it.

               And we can. The Orca's diesels are no longer smooth. Brody 
               suddenly sees something, and points.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

               The barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them, just off the 
               port side. They are drifting up to it.

                                     BRODY
                         The barrel!

               The strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand:  
               "Quiet!"

               Everything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up 
               on them.

                                     QUINT
                         It's him.

               He takes a killing lance from the rack. Hooper gets a 
               boathook.

                                     QUINT
                         He's under the keg. Careful --

               Hooper leans out gingerly, snagging the barrel with the hook.

               It bobs lightly in the water, an innocent bystander. Hooper 
               shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.

                                     QUINT
                              (suspicious)
                         Easy -- just want to goose him up. 
                         The minute he runs, drop it or you'll 
                         lose your hands.

               Hooper gets the line and starts hauling it up. No resistance.

               It comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck.  
               He and Quint exchange looks.

                                     QUINT
                         Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's 
                         been doin'.

               WATER - ANGLE

               Both men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching 
               the water on the aft side. From the opposite starboard 
               direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great 
               White. First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper 
               border of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the water 
               in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed 
               toward the unsuspecting men.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquired sense of 
               direction.

                                     BRODY
                              (top of his lungs)
                         Shark! Starboard!

               CLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT

               They turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them 
               from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom, 
               the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-
               off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it 
               passes.

               Past the stern the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope 
               out of Quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint, 
               peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze letters 
               out of "Orca." The shark begins an arc to sea, its fin cutting 
               the water, and starts circling the boat. Quint notices his 
               cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing 
               it.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us!
                              (then to Brody on the 
                              bridge)
                         Start the engine!

               The diesels start with a terrible grinding.

                                     QUINT
                         Easy! It'll tear right out!

                                     HOOPER
                              (hauling)
                         The shaft is giving.

               Hooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing 
               the deck for action once again.

                                     BRODY
                              (on bridge)
                         That's it! Radio in for help!

                                     QUINT
                         Shut up! Just pump her out!

                                     BRODY
                              (coming down off the 
                              bridge)
                         Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a 
                         call.

               Brody heads for the radio in the pilot house.

               QUINT - CLOSE

               A perfectly terrible look comes over him. He raises up and 
               starts after Brody. Brody disappears into the cabin. Quint 
               pauses outside and sees:

               INSERT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTERED BASEBALL BAT

               his calloused hand grabs it up fiercely.

               INT. RADIO SHACK

               Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on 
               the complex console.

                                     QUINT (O.S.)
                         Beg your pardon --

               ANGLE - DOORWAY

               Quint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door, 
               raising his bat.

                                     QUINT
                         Duty first and pleasure after --

               CLOSE - BRODY

               looking up in horror, covering his face.

               CLOSE - QUINT

               Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon.

               Crash!

               Sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of 
               metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the 
               ship-to-shore radio.

               Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the 
               bat.

                                     QUINT
                         Excuse me!

               Brody's adrenaline turns his fear into rage. His glasses are 
               cracked or broken by flying pieces of radio. He seizes the 
               bat, and pound the shattered radio for emphasis.

                                     BRODY
                         Some great idea! Now where are we?  
                         Some goddamn skipper you are. You're 
                         certifiable, y'know that? You're a 
                         real treat! Certifiable! Bananas!

               His tirade is interrupted by an urgent bellow from Hooper.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               Pointing at the fin.

                                     HOOPER
                         Coming right to us!

                                     QUINT
                         No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, 
                         he'll hit us head on --
                              (the engine clanks)
                         Slower! Throttle back ---

               ANGLE - OVER THE BOW

                                     QUINT
                              (raising harpoon)
                         Hard to port!

               Hooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot 
               at the upward rolling flank. He sinks it with careful 
               precision.

                                     QUINT
                         Try shakin' that out!

               Brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard, and 
               the barrel, changing over, catapults into the air before 
               plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.

                                     BRODY
                              (shouting to Quint)
                         Did you get him in the head?

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         No! No! No!
                              (to Hooper)
                         Swing around! After him!

               ON THE FLYBRIDGE

               Hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel. Diving 
               down. Up again -- Quint prepares another iron. Brody is 
               digging in his bag. He comes up with his 2" .357 service 
               revolver.

                                     QUINT
                         More gas... go to half! Get me right 
                         alongside him --

               The engine thuds and knocks.

                                     HOOPER
                              (shouting down)
                         We can't rev it up this high --

               Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca.

                                     QUINT
                         Watch it!

               Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

                                     QUINT
                         Atta boy!

               Quint leans to one side, harpoon over his head. The Great 
               White breaks water and...

                                     QUINT
                         Take two, they're small!

               He sinks it deep. We hear shots. As the new rope whips out, 
               Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation 
               police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands, 
               firing at the shark's head.

               Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the 
               barrel goes over.

                                     HOOPER
                              (shouting at Brody)
                         Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy 
                         on his own blood already!

                                     BRODY
                         I can't stand here doing nothing!

                                     QUINT
                         Order in the court!

               WATER LEVEL ANGLE

               He has seen the two barrels pop to the surface.

                                     QUINT
                              (racing over)
                         Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble 
                         with two!

               He yells to Hooper and Brody as he swings behind the controls.

                                     QUINT
                         Grab yourselves a couple of poles!

               Quint steers "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvers 
               toward the moving barrels. Quint peers down, steering closer 
               and closer.

                                     QUINT
                         Get ready! Now snag 'em!

               Together Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for 
               dear life as the shark changes course.

                                     QUINT
                         Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto 
                         the transom -- free ride.

               Brody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint 
               helps out by wheeling in a circle. He laughs to himself, 
               enjoying the spectacle.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               securing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang 
               overboard. Brody ties his now-perfect bowline adjacent cleat.

               WIDE ANGLE - ORCA

               The boat is jarred violently from side to side as the 
               underwater force of the Great White jerks and heaves them to 
               and fro, up and down, side to side...

               ANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY

               are both torn off their feet as the boat is thrust forward.

               FLYBRIDGE - QUINT

               sees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat.

                                     QUINT
                         Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a 
                         little reverse for you!

               The shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is 
               both horrifying and awesome. Its jaws break water, snapping 
               at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated.

               Quint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down:

                                     QUINT
                         Haul in -- watch the prop!

               With that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting another 
               shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and 
               balance. The shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing 
               closer.

                                     QUINT
                         Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us 
                         to pieces.

               He fires the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing 
               shower of spray.

               HOOPER AND BRODY

               They are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are 
               stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat

               on the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over 
               objects, skeetering across the deck. A tight jerking motion, 
               and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards. And 
               much too fast. Water is splashing up over the transom in its 
               backward wake. The engines groan and complain.

                                     QUINT
                         Damn head is too far away. He's too 
                         big.

               Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet.

               CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

               A moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength.

               The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood 
               spraying -- and the barrels fly over the water. They disappear 
               beneath the turbulent grey surface.

               The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat, 
               look out at the blank water.

               ANGLE - OCEAN

               Pop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the barrels surface -- 
               ready for more.

                                     QUINT
                              (amazed at the shark's 
                              strength)
                         He can't go so deep. Not with all 
                         those on him.

               Brody looks down at his feet. There is salt water up to their 
               shoe tops.

                                     BRODY
                         What about us?

                                     QUINT
                              (mentally assessing 
                              the damage)
                         Have to pump her steady, s'all.

               The barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water, 
               pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Follow him --
                              (to Brody)
                         You start pumpin' out here.

               Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and 
               checks the load.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)
                              (on bridge)
                         He's heading under -- !

                                     QUINT
                              (incredulously)
                         No way! He can't!

               ANGLE - OCEAN

               The barrels approaching the Orca dip below the surface, one -- 
               two -- three.

                                     BRODY
                         Where'd he go?

               Brody looks around. Hooper on the flying bridge searching in 
               all directions. Quint is looking more appalled every second.

                                     QUINT
                              (helplessly)
                         He can't stay down with three barrels 
                         on him! Where is he?!

                                     BRODY
                         Have you ever had one do this?

                                     QUINT
                              (and he means this)
                         No!

               Booming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and 
               Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms.

               WITH HOOPER ON THE FLY BRIDGE

               It seems the only place out of reach of the shark. Quint 
               climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol.

               Just then, the barrels pop up ahead, veer left, and duck 
               under.

                                     QUINT
                         Follow him!

                                     HOOPER
                         He's under!

               BRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW

                                     BRODY
                         There!
                              (points wildly)

               The barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow 
               sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless. Violent scraping 
               sounds.

                                     BRODY
                         He's trying to sink us!

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Dead astern! Zig-zag!

               Quint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the 
               fight of (and for) his life.

               The Orca taking evasive action. But the three barrels are 
               closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying 
               themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft.

                         BRODY
                 He's chasing us! I 
                 don't believe it. 

                                                       QUINT
                                               Full throttle! To port!

               ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

               Hooper is jamming the throttle forward, but the engine is 
               pounding and knocking wildly. The barrels circle and move 
               in. Quint has his rifle ready.

                                     HOOPER
                              (suddenly giving Quint 
                              the wheel)
                         Hold her.

               He leaps to his gear, trying desperately to get his dart 
               gun.

               Just then, the shark attacks, breaking water and rising over 
               the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectoral fins, belly, 
               falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fires 
               into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

                                     HOOPER
                              (loading)
                         Keep him there! Keep him!

               The Orca shudders from side to side. From Hooper's point of 
               view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws, 
               shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to 
               side, trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull. Quint has 
               reloaded and is firing into the fish. Brody has a wicked 
               pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing 
               and gouging it, trying for the eyes. The killing lust is on 
               all three men.

                                     QUINT
                         Throttling back!

               The boat surges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench, 
               and disengages. The dorsal fin circles off, beginning a wide 
               loop around the boat.

               The engine quivers and dies, the boat without power, rolling 
               half awash, a wounded victim.

               The fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath 
               the waves. There is complete silence.

               THE THREE MEN ON DECK

               In the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the 
               hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and 
               pops of the cooling, dying engines.

               QUINT AND THE TRANSOM

               He eyes the stern. Huge cracks and broken timber testify to 
               the fury of the attack.

                                     QUINT
                              (very quietly, to 
                              Hooper)
                         What can that gun of yours do?

                                     HOOPER
                         Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine 
                         nitrate. If I can hit him. I can 
                         kill him. But I gotta be close.  
                         Very close.

                                     BRODY
                              (the awful realization)
                         You gotta go in the water...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ON DECK, LATER

               Quint and Hooper are assembling the shark cage, its shiny 
               bars the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is working 
               too, bolting the sections together.

                                     HOOPER
                              (in command now)
                         Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.

               The men are speaking in near whispers, quiet in the silence 
               that surrounds them. Hooper is in his wet suit, adjusting 
               weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stern.

               Quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section.

               Hooper climbs in though the top.

                                     HOOPER
                         Take me up.

               Brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hooper into the 
               air. Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hooper crouching in 
               the cage, examining it for stresses; satisfied, he holds out 
               his hand. Quint puts the spear gun into it.

               CLOSE ON HOOPER IN THE CAGE

               He examines his weapon, checking the power load, with the 
               big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razor 
               point.

                                     HOOPER
                         Lower away, Chief.
                              (then, to Quint)
                         Try and keep him off me till I'm 
                         under.

               Hooper inside, looking out the bars of the cage, gives Brody 
               a reassuring smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his 
               teeth and checks his regulator. Brody steps back, and with 
               Quint guiding the cage, begins lowering it off the gin pole 
               boom arm into the sea alongside the boat.

               Brody and Hooper stare at each another as their faces pass, 
               Hooper sliding down into the cold grey ocean.

               As Hooper disappears beneath the surface, Quint and Brody 
               exchange a long look between them.

               UNDERWATER - CAGE

               HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

               Submerging. The sky, horizon, water line, clean fresh sea 
               air then... the magnificent innerspaces, with bubbles 
               sparkling in front of us.

               ANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE

               as he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking around 
               360 degrees. He removes the rubber guard from the needle and 
               waits.

               EXT. THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

               Their turning heads tell us that the barrels are still 
               circling.

               Suddenly, both heads stop turning.

               THE SEA

               The barrels have come to a stop. Delicately, they change 
               course and meander toward the lowered cage.

               UNDERWATER - HOOPER

               His back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep 
               and turns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on 
               something monstrous... and fascinating.

               HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

               The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in 
               the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- 
               comes the shark. It moves with no apparent effort, sinuous 
               beyond comparison. As it nears the cage, it turns, and its 
               ghastly length passes right in front of him: first the snout, 
               then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

               Hooper tentatively reaches out. It is too far for the 
               strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, 
               iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge 
               the passing currents with pink.

               SURFACE

               The trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orca 
               above. Brody and Quint leap back.

               HOOPER - CLOSE

               The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hooper, 
               expecting the shark to attack out of that same general 
               direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars, 
               breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and... 
               we see that the shark attacking from behind him.

               The cage is sent careening. Hooper grabs the bars for dear 
               life. The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal 
               jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending 
               the bars like clothes hangers. Hooper can't turn the pointed 
               end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the 
               non-rational attacker as possible.

               Hooper is trapped.

               The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges 
               again. The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars, 
               the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso, 
               the tail thrusting it forward. Hooper drops the strychnine 
               pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture 
               depth.

               All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating 
               Hooper at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hooper 
               fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out of 
               the cage. The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad 
               head won't shake loose.

               Hooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole.

               ANGLE - SHARK

               The shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after 
               Hooper.

               Hooper nearly recovers the pole. Again it slips from his 
               frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss.  
               Hooper turns and looks up.

               The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

               SURFACE

               One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls 
               taut.

               HOOPER - DEEP

               Turning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a 
               moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward.

               SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

               The Orca is listing dangerously aft, the ginpole bent almost 
               to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul 
               up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a 
               hand-winch. The ginpole is splitting.

                                     QUINT
                         Let go of it!

               The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale... 
               the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging 
               it, but Quint won't give up the winch. Brody hauls on the 
               rope barehanded.

               UNDERWATER - HOOPER

               maneuvering downward, away from the jaws... Suddenly the 
               crazed shark veers upward for the surface.

               SURFACE - QUINT

               The winch is working faster now, Quint demonically winding 
               it in. The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks 
               water.

               Brody is horrified. The cage is empty!

                         QUINT
                    (a horrible scream)
                 He's comin' up -- !

                                                       BRODY
                                               He's taken him!

               MASTER ANGLE

               The shark breaks water right beside the Orca, rising with a 
               great whooshing noise. It rises vertically, towering overhead, 
               blocking out the sun. The pectoral fins seem to reach forward.  
               The shark, in all of its monstrous glory, falls onto the 
               stern of the boat with a shattering crash, narrowly missing 
               Quint and Brody. It drives the stern underwater, the ocean 
               pours in over the transom. The jaws snap from side to side.  
               Brody flounders backwards away from it.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He is clinging to the mast for dear life, as the ship begins 
               to tilt to stern, and everything starts to break loose around 
               him.

               NIGHTMARE ANGLE - DECK OF THE ORCA

               The giant jaws are snapping irresistibly at everything: great 
               chunks of wood torn out of the deck and superstructure.

               Deck chair, irons, rope, gear, beercans, bottles, Brody's 
               bag, all are food for the insatiable maw blindly churning 
               away.

               Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at 
               this ultimate violation of his territory. He snatches up a 
               lance and hurls himself at the shark with a wordless bellow.

               The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a 
               treacherous incline, slippery with blood and seawater. Quint's 
               footing falters and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell, 
               the big teeth seize him and snap.

               Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is 
               clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and 
               legs suddenly contort as the shark's teeth meet across his 
               torso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his body 
               tumble from the shark's mouth.

               Brody sees the horror, hears the screams -- in his 
               desperation, he tears loose one of Hooper's remaining air 
               tanks, and hurls it at the monster. It tumbles into the bloody 
               well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel 
               blocking the cruel jaws.

               The shark's head shakes even more violently, trying to clear 
               the cold iron, but the tank is in to stay.

               DECK OF THE ORCA, LISTING BADLY

               To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling 
               deck, bracing himself in the cabin door to avoid pitching 
               down into the bloody mouth. He fights his way into the cabin, 
               already a shambles.

               Below him, on the deck, the shark lunges again, shifting 
               weight so that the boat in now stern down, and listing to 
               the side. Water from the sea pours into the cabin.

               Another lunge by the shark. The huge snout and jaws slam up 
               against the doorframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

               More seawater. To stay in the cabin is to go down with the 
               ship.

               Brody clambers as far from the shark as he can, against the 
               forward wall of the pilothouse. He sees the window Hooper 
               used before. It's blocked by barrels and debris. He breaks 
               the side window highest above the water, edges out onto the 
               battered bridge.

               The shark rolls around, now half in the water. The ship is 
               sinking, the sea is not a viable alternative. Brody climbs 
               up into the flying bridge.

               The shark is still lunging and snapping. Brody is forced to 
               climb higher and higher as the ship slowly sinks beneath 
               him.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He scrambles for his life onto the flying bridge, sees the M-
               1 stuck there, seizes it.

               OVER BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STERN

               He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on 
               the steel tanks, silver gleaming in the bloody shark's mouth.  
               He fires. And fires. Bullets shatter the shark's teeth, 
               punching holes in the dripping snout.

               WIDE ON THE ORCA � EXPLOSION

               With a muffled boom, the perfect symmetry of the shark is 
               suddenly blown apart in a geyser of steel and blood as Brody's 
               shot hits the pressurized tank. A 30-foot cloud of water, 
               steel, shark and debris covers the sky.

               A gigantic convulsion hurls the Great White's mangled body 
               into the sea. The Orca slowly begins to turn over in its 
               death roll.

               UNDERWATER

               The shark's carcass floating down in a cloud of blood and 
               debris.

               A shadow clouds the waters, and the Orca's mass begins to 
               slip into the frame.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               Emerging from beneath the surface, he raises his mask, spits 
               out his mouthpiece and kicks toward Brody.

               SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER

               Brody is holding onto a cushion, barely afloat, relieved the 
               shark is dead, yet stunned to see Hooper is still alive. The 
               two men share weak laughter, which soon trails off.

                                     HOOPER
                         Quint...?

                         No...
                              (notices something 
                              O.S.)
                         You think we can get back with those?

               SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER - ANOTHER ANGLE

               They swim through the debris, using two barrels as floats, 
               as dozens of seagulls feast on shark remains on the surface.

                                     BRODY

                         think.

                                     BRODY

EXT.  NIGHT - HOLLYWOOD HILLS, LOS ANGELES
    
Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree. Then the headlights turn - a
street sign is suddenly brightly lit. The words on the sign
read... "Mulholland Drive." The car moves under the sign as
it turns and the words fall once again into darkness.

EXT. NIGHT - MULHOLLAND DRIVE
    
Gliding we follow the car - an older black Cadillac limousine
- as it winds its way up Mulholland Drive through the
darkness of the Hollywood Hills. There is no one else on the
road. As we drift closer to the car...

Two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat. A
beautiful, younger, dark-haired woman sits in back. She sits
close up against the door and stares out into the darkness.
She seems to be thinking about something. Suddenly she turns
and looks ahead. The car is slowing and moving off to the
side of the road.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		What are you doing? You don't stop
		here ...
    
The car stops - half on, half off the road at a dark, blind
curve. Both men turn to the woman.
    
				DRIVER
		Get out of the car.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT.  FURTHER UP MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
    
Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.
    

    
The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
Mulholland Drive.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. EXT. - CADILLAC LIMOUSINE
    
The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out
of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid.
The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets
up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down
below. She clumsily starts down toward it.

HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at
Franklin Avenue. A car races by and its headlights flare on
her face. Her expression shows fear and panic. She doesn't
know where she is or where to go. She runs frantically across
the street. She moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her
into a residential area.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman crosses Sunset Boulevard. Coming up Sunset in the
distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going.
She hurries into the darkness of another residential area. A
car turns onto the street and comes toward her. She
instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes.
  
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
As if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves
desperately down another residential street. A drunken couple
round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward
her. She runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front
of an apartment building. The couple passes by without
noticing her. Feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion
overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep.

EXT.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE   - NIGHT
    
Police, paramedics surround the wreckage. Two detectives,
HARRY MCKNIGHT and NEAL DOMGAARD (both mid 40's to 50), stare
at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the
crime scene lights. A coroner's van pulls out just after an
ambulance. The ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds
off. The coroner's van cruises slowly. Detective Harry
McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring. They
do not look at each other. They are each motionless for a
long moment.
  
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		You feel it?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Yeah.
    
They continue to stare.
    
 
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along
		the shoulder ... man up the road said he
		saw two cars drag racin'...then you got
		that blind corner.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		The boys found this on the floor in back
		of the Caddy.
    
Neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Yeah, they showed me
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Could be unrelated.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Could be...any of those dead kids wearin'
		pearl earrings?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		That's what I'm thinkin'.
    
Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy.
He looks out and wonders.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - EARLY DAWN
    
The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. It is just getting
light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a
suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its
trunk open. The cab driver appears with two suitcases which
he sets down next to the car. The red-headed woman and the
cab driver both go back through the iron gate. The woman in
the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into
the courtyard of this apartment building. She sees the red-
headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come
back out with more luggage.

    
They leave the apartment door open. When the red-headed woman
and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the
bags into the trunk and backseat. Their backs are to the
woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly
into the courtyard and through the open apartment door.

The woman comes into a living room where a single trunk
remains. She goes further into the apartment and crouches
down in a back corner of the kitchen. She listens as
footsteps come across the courtyard. She hears the red-headed
woman and the cab driver get the trunk. She hears them set it
down once they have it in the courtyard. She hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. She
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. Remaining
frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red-
headed woman walks right past her, grabs a set of keys off
the kitchen counter, then leaves the apartment. The woman can
hear the door being locked. She lets go, slides to the
kitchen floor, and passes out.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT , HOLLYWOOD - MORNING
    
Two well-dressed men HERB and DAN (mid 30's) are sitting at a
table drinking coffee. Herb has finished eating his
breakfast, but Dan hasn't touched his bacon and eggs - he
appears too nervous to eat. A blonde waitress with a
nameplate saying "DIANE" lays the check on their table
smiles, then walks off.
    
				HERB
		Why did you want to go to breakfast if
		you're not hungry?

				DAN
		I just wanted to come here.

				HERB
		To Denny's? I wasn't going to say
		anything, but why Denny's?
    
				DAN
		This Denny's.
    
				HERB
		Okay. Why this Denny's?
    
    
				DAN
		It's kind of embarrassing but,
    
				HERB
		Go ahead.
    
				DAN
		I had a dream about this place.
    
				HERB
		Oh boy.
    
				DAN
		You see what I mean...
    
				HERB
		Okay, so you had a dream about this
		place. Tell me.
    
				DAN
		Well ... it's the second one I've had, but
		they were both the same......they start
		out that I'm in here but it's not day or
		night. It's kinda half night, but it
		looks just like this except for the
		light, but I'm scared like I can't tell
		ya. Of all people you're standing right
		over there by that counter. You're in
		both dreams and you're scared. I get
		even more frightened when I see how
		afraid you are and then I realize what it
		is - there's a man...in back of this
		place. He's the one ... he's the one
		that's doing it. I can see him through
		the wall. I can see his face and I hope
		I never see that face ever outside a
		dream.
    
Herb stares at Dan to see if he will continue. Dan looks
around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.
    
				DAN (cont'd)
		That's it.
    
				HERB
		So, you came to see if he's out there?

				DAN
		To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
    
				HERB
		Right then.

    
Herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to
pay. Dan just sits.
    
As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan
is turning to look at him. From Dan's point of view Herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream.
Herb gets a strange feeling, turns back and finishes up with
the cashier. He motions for Dan to follow him. Dan rises
reluctantly and he and Herb make their way outside.

EXT. DENNY'S
    
Now Herb waits for Dan to lead the way.
    
				DAN
		Around here.
    
Dan takes Herb across the front of Denny's to a narrow
sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back.
    
They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a
payphone. Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear
corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.
    
CLOSER ON DAN
    
Beads of sweat cover his face. He finds it difficult to
breathe. Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but Herb can feel something himself.
    
The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
    
Suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into Dan's eyes.
    
Dan lurches back. All his breath is suddenly gone. He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. Dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
    
Herb looks up - the man is gone. He looks down to Dan.
    
				HERB
		Dan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan!
    
He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse
in the neck. He listens for breathing. His friend is dead.
    

    
				HERB (cont'd)
		My God!

A blonde girl walking with an old woman approaches us. As the
blonde's face fills the screen we move with her and stay with
her as she goes. Her face is bright and her eyes move here
and there taking in everything. She can hardly believe she's
in Los Angeles - the City of Dreams. She and the old woman
pass under a sign which reads "WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES."
The girl smiles and looks around excited by every detail.

The girl and the old lady exit the terminal with their bags.
An older gentleman has joined the old lady. They stop at the
taxicab stand. The old lady takes the blonde girl's hand.
    
				OLD LADY
		It's time to say goodbye, Betty. It's
		been so nice travelling with you.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and
		nervous. It was sure great to have you
		to talk to.
    
				IRENE
		Now, remember I'll be watching for you on

		Okay Irene. Won't that be the day.

				IRENE
		The best of luck to you, Betty. Take

				BETTY
		Okay I will. Thanks again.
    
Betty and Irene give each other a hug. The old gentleman nods
to Betty and takes Irene off. Betty smiles after them.
Suddenly someone is grabbing her bags. She turns abruptly to
find she is next in line and her cab is waiting. She turns
once more and waves at Irene as her bags are loaded into the
trunk of the cab.
    
				CAB DRIVER
		Where to?
    
				BETTY

		1612 Havenhurst.

They get into the cab and close their doors. The cab pulls

Betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of
the cab looking at every building, tree and sign. Each street
sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to
herself as they pass by. She sees La Tijera, La Cienega,
Venice Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Wilshire
Boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach Fountain and turn
right. Betty's heart is pounding when she sees Havenhurst
and the cab turns left. In the middle of the block on the
right the cab pulls over and stops. Betty sees her new
home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building,
built during the golden age of cinema.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. 1612 HAVENHURST
    
The cab driver puts Betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to
her. She can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away.
Betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center. A sign on a door to her right reads
Manager and she rings the bell.

    
An older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door.
An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door.
    
				MANAGER
		Hi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.

				BETTY
		I am, Mrs. Lanois. It is Mrs. Lanois
		isn't it?
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		In all my living glory, baby.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		You can call me Coco ... everybody does.
		Stay there, I'll get the key.
    
				BETTY
		Okay, Coco.
    
Coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling
a huge drag off her cigarette. She starts off into the
courtyard and Betty picks up her bags and follows. As Coco
speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
    
				COCO
		I guess it was your grandfather, was
		it ... he called me to check in, said you
		were on your way and for you to call when
		you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
    
				BETTY
		Yes, he is. He raises corn.
    
				COCO
		Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood
		these days too.
    
				BETTY
		Well, I ...
    
				COCO
		You don't have to tell me. It's written
		all over that pretty face of yours.. You
		came here to be an actress. I just hope
		you'll remember there's never been a
		great poem called "tits and ass."
    
    
				BETTY
		I...
    
				COCO
		You probably don't remember her, but
		Louise Bonner lives right over there in
		number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs
		a damn good acting class.
    
				BETTY
		Have many famous actors and actresses
		lived here? I was meaning to ask you
		that.
    
				COCO
		Honey, all the great ones came through
		here at one time or another.
    
A haunting music begins to swell.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
    
		People say in the springtime when the
		wind blows the smell of the jasmine you
		can still feel the presence of everyone
		of them.
    
				BETTY
		I guess I've come to quite a place.
    
				COCO
		Sweetheart, you don't know the half of
		it.
    
The music fades.
    
Coco looks down suddenly. On the cobblestone courtyard in
front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
			(yelling up)
		WILKINS! ... (no answer) ... THAT DOG CRAPS

		You don't have pets do you?

    
				BETTY
		No, I don't.
    
				COCO
		That's good. They're allowed, but I
		don't like 'em...for obvious reasons.
		One man used to live here that had a

where the dark-haired woman can be seen showering through
rippled glass. There's the sound of a door opening. We see a

We can hear the dark-haired woman's frightened breathing as

		Wow!

		Everybody in this building's pretty much

		If you want, later I'll introduce you

		Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

				COCO
		You got it! See you later honey.
    
Coco leaves and closes the door behind her. Betty begins to
explore the apartment.- After walking a circle in the living
room she passes through the kitchen. She moves down a
hallway looking at paintings and posters. She goes into the
bedroom. She smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge
ornately carved head and foot board. She notices the soiled
dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. She
stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has
all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling
tiles. As she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in
the mirror above it. Suddenly something catches her eye and
she opens the shower stall. There before her is the naked,
beautiful dark-haired woman.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my!
    
She quickly closes the shower door.

There's a silence.

		There was an accident. I came here.

There is another silence.

		Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get

Betty goes to the bathroom door and is closing it when she
stops and looks back in.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What's your name?
    
We see a close-up of the dark-haired woman. We see her eyes
widen with a kind of fear. She's frantically thinking -
searching her mind for an answer.

		We should get a doctor.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
				BETTY
		But, this could be serious.

				RITA
		No...I need to sleep.
    
				BETTY
		If you have a concussion you shouldn't
		sleep.
    
				RITA
		It will be okay if I sleep. I need to
		lie down and sleep.

				BETTY
		All right, but...I'm going to check on
		you.
    
Rita lies down and is instantly asleep. Betty leans over her
and listens to her breathing. She gets a blanket and drapes
it over the beautiful sleeping Rita, then leaves the room.

EXT. - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LOW RENT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
The street level of the office building is filthy and houses
stores selling racks of cheap toys. Up above we see office
windows and a big sign saying "Office Space For Rent" along
with a telephone number to call. We drift in toward one of
the windows on the sixth floor.
    
							CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE ON SIXTH FLOOR
    
Two men are in the room, JOE and ED. Joe leans up against a
rack of filing cabinets. He is in his late twenties. He
looks like a run down, heavy metal rocker - wears a blue
denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and
motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious.
    
The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.
    
				JOE
		So man, that's unheard of ... an accident
		like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
    
				ED
		Unreal ... so, you're looking good.
		Whatcha doin' these days?
    
				JOE
		Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff
		for this guy.
    
				ED
		Making ends meet, huh.
    
				JOE
		Hardly.
    
				ED
		Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
    
				JOE
		Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope
		you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
    
				ED
		It was just a thing. The story made you
		laugh.
    
				JOE
		Yeah, that's a funny story.
    
Looking like he's rubbing the small of his back Joe moves
over to Ed at his desk. Joe looks down to the surface of the
desk - to a small worn black book.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		So, there it is ... Ed's famous black book.

    
				ED
		Yeah, the history of the world in phone
		numbers.
    
Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view
holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out
and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains
out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down
on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the
wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window
behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and
places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's
right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the
finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled
scream.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh...man!
    
With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves
slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the
corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.
He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy
set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and
cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he
begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on
a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with
her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling
her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her
into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man
with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		Hey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here
		and use the phone. Help me out. You
		gotta call the hospital.
    
The man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's
seeing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		I mean it! Get down here quick! She's
		hurt and I can't do everything myself,
		man.

    
Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back
down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,
pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long
thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office
with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line
between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She
starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe
grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,
but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		No, no, no. You gotta be turned around.
    
He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her
around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two
silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the
vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.
The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him
and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be
screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet
into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out
the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the
building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh ... man!
    
Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor.
    
				VOICES
		What the hell .... what happened? What's
		this cord doing here? It's the vacuum.
		It's the vacuum what did it.
    
Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
Eddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger. Joe picks up
the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CENTURY CITY BUILDING - DAY
    
We see three men sitting at a conference table RAYMOND(RAY)
HOTT -president of production, wearing a crisp blue
suit,VINCENT DARBY -senior vice-president, wearing a crisp
green suit and ROBERT SMITH -talent manager, wearing a crisp
brown suit. Ray and Mr. Darby sit at the head of the table
and Robert Smith sits along the side. A younger man -ADAM
KESHER enters and sits down, with an arrogant nonchalance,
next to Robert Smith. Adam is dressed in a frumpy old
fashioned plaid shirt, worn jacket, dark blue cotton slacks,
and a pair of old brown wing tips. As he sits he is holding
and twirling a vintage "7-iron" golf club.
    
				ADAM
		So what's the problem?
    
				RAY
		There is no problem.
    
				ADAM
		So why did you idiots bring me
		here? ... I'm in the middle of making a
		picture.
    
Silence for a moment. A man enters through a rear door and
whispers something to Mr. Darby and shows him something on a
piece of paper. Mr. Darby studies the piece of paper.
    
				MR. DARBY
			(to man who entered)
		What was it last time?
    
The man who entered points to something on the paper.
    
				MR. DARBY (cont'd)
		Okay, let's try the next one.
    
The man nods and leaves.
    
				RAY
		He isn't gonna like it.
    
				MR. DARBY
		We'll see.
    
				ADAM
		Hello ... who're we talkin' about here?
    
Robert Smith shuffles nervously in his chair next to Adam.

    
				ROBERT SMITH
		You see Adam... there are some suggestions
		which are to be brought forward ... and I
		know you said you would entertain
		suggestions and that's all anybody here
		is asking you to do.
    
				ADAM
		What're you talking about?

EXT. CENTURY CITY - DAY
    
Before us is a huge modern office building of glass and
steel. Two men in dark suits have exited a large limousine
and are walking up into the building. We drift up the facade,
higher and higher moving in toward the top of the building.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
The men exit an elevator and move through a lobby where a
plaque beneath an enormous bronze sculpture reads "Ryan
Entertainment". Gliding we travel behind the two men down a
wide, carpeted hallway with blonde wood and glass on each
side. They enter through two large blonde wooden doors to the
conference room.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
    
The men in dark suits go in as if they owned the place. Ray,
Mr. Darby and Robert Smith stand immediately. Adam remains
seated. Mr. Darby is the only one near enough to attempt a
hand shake, but when he offers his hand it is not taken. The
men in dark suits sit down without wasting a movement and
without acknowledging anyone. One of the men in a dark suit
opens a briefcase. Ray has been trying to make
introductions.
    
				RAY
		Ah... the Castigliane brothers. Let me
		introduce you around ... please ... sit down.
		(after they've already seated
		themselves) ... this is Mr. Darby whom you
		know and this is the director Adam
		Kesher and his manager Robert Smith
    
The Castigliane brothers do not acknowledge any of this,
however, during the introductions the one with the briefcase
removes a photo of a girl and sets it in front of Ray.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Ah... she's very pretty.
    
We see the photo of the girl - of a nice looking blonde -
someone we've never seen before. Adam looks like he doesn't
know what's going on and he's getting upset about not
knowing. His manager, Robert Smith, is beginning to see the
makings of a confrontation - he's starting to panic.
    
				MR. DARBY
			(referring to Castigliane
			brothers)
		May I offer you gentlemen anything?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Espresso.

				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Nothing. 
    
				ADAM
		Uh  what's the photo for?
    
				MR. DARBY
			(picking up phone and speaking)
		One espresso ... no, that's it.
			(sets phone down - addresses
			Castigliane brothers)
		I think you're going to enjoy your
		espresso this time... I've been doing
		quite a bit of research knowing how hard
		you are to please... this one comes highly
		recommended.
    
				ADAM
		What's the photo for?
    
				RAY
			(to Adam)
		A recommendation... a recommendation to
		you Adam.
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Not a recommendation.
    
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		What girl? For what? What is this Ray?
    
Ray, still standing with a forced smile, turns to the
Castigliane brothers.
    
				RAY
		We'd be happy to put her in the pile for
		considerations ... you'd be pleased to know
		there's quite a lot of interest in this
		role.
    
				ADAM
		Interest?! There's six of the top
		actresses that want this thing.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		Ray...you better take care of this.
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		Hold on ... hold on, Adam.
    
				ADAM
		Hold on!!!!!!!! There's no way, there's
		no way!!!
    
Luigi Castigliane's espresso is brought in by the man who had
been in earlier. The man sets the espresso down in front of
Luigi and takes a step back. The room becomes silent -
watching the Espresso Man and Luigi. Without looking up Luigi
speaks softly.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
			(leading forward to hear)
		Pardon?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
		Of course. Excuse me.
    
The Espresso Man leaves the room. Luigi looks at the
espresso. Vincenzo stares at Adam.
    
Adam is doing his best to stare down Vincenzo. The Espresso
man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the
espresso.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN (cont'd)
		Will that be all, Sir?
    
Luigi doesn't answer and after a moment of standing very
still waiting, the Espresso Man turns and leaves the room.
    
Adam is stared down by Vincenzo and averts his eyes to the
espresso cup. He looks around at Ray and Mr. Darby - seeing
them stare at the espresso cup.
    
Vincenzo keeps staring at Adam.
    
Luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand.
With his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it
above the napkin. He brings the cup and napkin to his mouth.
He takes a sip of espresso. A small fleeting expression forms
on Luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is
going to vomit. His mouth opens and he allows the espresso
to fall and dribble onto the napkin. He pushes any remaining
espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. He holds it in
that position for a moment.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Is shit!
    
Luigi Castigliane stands up.
    
				RAY
		I'm sorry. That was a highly
		recommended...
    
				MR. DARBY
		That's considered one of the finest
		espressos in the world , Sir.
    
Luigi just stands there. A small thread on his left suit
jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back
into the fabric. Vincenzo closes his briefcase, takes out a
hankerchief and cleans his nose - then stands, placing the
handkerchief back in his pocket.
    
				ADAM
		Wait a minute!! What's going on here?
    
Vincenzo just stares toward Adam as if he's not even there.
    
				ADAM
		There's no way that girl is in my movie!
    
Silence.

    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		That is the girl.
    
The Castigliane brothers begin to leave. Adam stands up
trembling with anger.
    
				ADAM
		Hey!!!!! That girl is not in my film!!!
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		It is no longer your film.
    
Adam turns white and stands very still as this sinks in. The
Castigliane brothers leave. As the big blonde wood doors
close behind them Adam starts to boil.
    
				ADAM
			(screaming)
		You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
    
				RAY
		I'll speak to someone.
    
				ADAM
			(turning to his manager)
		And you'd better speak to someone
		too ... or find yourself another client!!
		This smells like a set-up to me!
			(back to Ray)
		And by the way, Ray, I don't know who
		these guys are kidding, but every foot of
		film I've shot is in a vault at the lab
		that only I can access. No one's getting
		that film!!
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		This is a catastrophe...
			(turning toward Ray)
		you told me they might insist on a girl,
		that's all.
    
				ADAM
		Why didn't you tell me, Robert? That's
		what I mean ... you set me up! I woulda
		never come here.
			(standing)
		I'm leaving. I'm a director you don't
		want to lose ... you guys better fix this!!
    
Adam storms out of the room.

    
				RAY
			(standing)
		Well...I didn't know that was going to
		happen.

EXTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - CENTURY CITY - DAY
    
Adam exits the building carrying his 7-iron. An attendant
takes his valet parking ticket. While Adam, still fuming,
waits for his car he notices the big limo standing off to one
side. He stares at the car and the huge limo driver leaning
up against the front driver's side door.
    
Adam's car arrives - a late model Porsche. Before Adam gets
into his car he addresses the attendant.
    
				ADAM
		Did the Castigliane brothers get out of
		that limo?
    
				ATTENDANT
		They two guys in dark suits?
    
Adam nods and walks over to the limo. The limo driver eyes
him and his 7-iron suspiciously.
    
				ADAM
		Castigliane brothers?
    
				LIMO DRIVER
		Beat it!
    
				ADAM
		O.K.
    
Adam raises his 7-iron and smashes out the limo's windshield.
He whacks two big dents in the hood, then smashes out a
headlight. The limo driver starts towards him. Adam laughs,
runs to his car and takes off.

INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - LATER DAY
    
Betty is stretched out on the big leather couch in the living
room. A half eaten sandwich and chips are on a plate on the
coffee table next to her. She is talking on the phone.

    
				BETTY
		No Grandpa, you wouldn't believe it.
		It's more beautiful than I ever
		dreamed ... no she left me a lot of food.
		The refrigerator's full ... Aunt Ruthie
		said she'd call me when she got
		settled... it was real smooth. I sat next
		to a lady who gave up her first class
		seat to a boy with a broken leg. She was
		so nice to me. She invited me to her
		house sometime. It's in Bel Air which is
		a place where people have a lot of
		money... I will. Everybody's telling me
		to be careful, but I sure love it here
		Grandpa. Thank you for helping me get
		here ... yeah, it's long distance. I love
		you. Say hello to Grams. Give her a big
		kiss for me. Okay, I love you
		Grandpa ... bye.
    
Betty hangs up the phone, takes a big bite of her sandwich
and lays flat out on the couch, chewing and smiling up at the
ceiling. She suddenly remembers Rita and her promise to look
in on her. She gets off the couch and goes into the bedroom.

Satisfied that all is well, Betty quietly leaves the bedroom.

INT. - EXT. APARTMENT - DAY
    
Betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself
a cup of coffee. She takes the coffee outside to the
courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway.
She sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun.
Across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in
one of the apartments. She drinks her coffee and listens to
the music.
    
Some birds fly by overhead. She takes another sip of coffee.
The blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in
tempo and volume. The phone inside rings. Betty takes her
coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind
her. She crosses to the leather couch and picks up the
phone.
    
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Hello ... Aunt Ruth!! I can't tell you how
		happy I am. Your place is so fantastic!
		Yes ... Coco...what a character. I really
		like her... that's too bad...waiting in an

		mosquito plane? ... Oh I get it. How long
		does that take from Montreal? ... Well,
		you'll sleep good tonight ... Hudson Bay
		sounds beautiful ...oh well, I hope you
		packed your coat. (laughs). You mean

		Aunt Ruth... I'll try. I'll study those
		lines until I know them inside out.
		Yes, either right here on this fabulous
		leather couch or I'll take them with a
		coffee in the courtyard like a regular
		movie star. (laughs). Oh! I got a real
		shock to find your friend Rita here. She
		was in the shower and I opened the
		door ... Rita ... what do you mean? She was
		in an accident ... your friend Rita. No,
		Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't
		see her. She's sleeping. No... she's
		very nice. I'm sure there's some
		explanation, Aunt Ruth... I don't think we
		have to do that. Please don't worry.
		I'll take care of it. No, I'll let you
		know. Where can I ... okay I'll get it

		No, please don't worry... thank you so
		much for letting me stay here. You've
		made me so happy... thank you, thank you.
		Please don't worry... Aunt Ruth we don't
		need the police. I'll call you when you
		get to Hudson Bay. Please...
		please ... Goodbye Aunt Ruth.
    
Betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. She sits for a
moment listening. Silently she stands and moves toward the
bedroom. As she approaches the bedroom door she stops at
something she sees. Rita is sitting on the edge of the bed
crying quietly. Betty goes into the bedroom. Rita looks up
at her with desperation.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You're awake... I think I misunderstood
		you. I thought you knew my Aunt and
		that's why you were here. I just talked
		to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me
		to call the police.

    
Rita starts crying harder, bows down, covering her face with
her hands.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Rita?
    
				RITA
			(crying harder)
		I'm... sorry. I ...

Betty's heart softens.
    
				BETTY
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(still sobbing)
		I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke
		up... I thought sleep would do it ...
    
Betty kneels down in front of her.
    
				BETTY
		What's wrong?
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I don't know who I am.
    
				BETTY
		What do you mean? You're Rita.
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I'm not. I don't know what my name is.
		I don't know who I am!!
    
Betty looks down at the purse next to Rita's dress. She picks
it up and hands it to Rita.
    
				BETTY
		This is your purse. Your name must be in
		your purse.
    
Rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation. She hesitates.
Something is worrying her. She looks at Betty for help.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You want to know don't you?
    
				RITA
		I ... yes, but ... I ...

    
				BETTY
		Open it!
    
Rita slowly unzips the purse. The pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.
    
Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing. They look at each
other, then back to the money.
    
Rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed. She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... A BLUE KEY. Betty
sees Rita's expression change to a kind of <U>horror</U>.
(note: This blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key.)

INTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
Ray crosses a carpeted closed area. He mounts a flight of
stairs. At the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood
door. Ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it.
The door opens automatically. Ray passes through and goes
down a narrow hall. At the end of the hall there is a small
elevator. Again Ray punches in a code. The elevator opens and
Ray goes in. The elevator door closes, but the elevator does
not move. Ray waits. Finally, a woman's voice comes through a
speaker.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
		Who is it please?
    
				RAY
		Raymond Harris ... 20743.
    
The elevator begins to move up. When it stops, the door opens
and Ray walks into a windowless reception area where a
beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern,
built-in desk.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
			(very quietly)
		You may go right in, Ray.
    
Ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. The
receptionist pushes a button behind her desk - chimes sound
as the double doors open to an enormous office with no
windows. Heavy rich brown curtains line the walls.
    
    
Ray enters and the doors close behind him. Ray takes a few
steps forward, then stops. There is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. Cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. Beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. The man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. His head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. His suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. His manservant stands in the shadows behind him.
    
				RAY
		Good afternoon Mr. Roque. (pronounced
		Rowk).
    
Mr. Roque stares at Ray silently.

		Do you want him replaced?
    
Mr. Roque continues to stare.
    
				RAY
		I know they said...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Then?
    
				RAY
		Then... I guess it's so .... alright, but
		that means we should ...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Yes?
    
				RAY
		Shut everything down ... Is that something
		that...do you want us to shut everything
		down?
    
Silence. Ray doesn't know what to do. He struggles to
interpret Mr. Roque's silence. He waits. Mr. Roque does
nothing but stare.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Then we'll shut everything down.
    
Silence.
    
Ray turns. The doors open as he approaches them and he
leaves the room. The doors close.

EXTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - CENTURY CITY
    
Vincenzo and Luigi are staring silently and without
expression at the broken windshield of the limousine. The
limousine driver suddenly starts signaling to a car entering
the driveway to the building. He turns to the Castigliane
brothers.
    
				LIMO DRIVER
		The other car is here sirs. Please allow
		me.
    
The limo driver opens the rear door of the new limo, then
hurries around and opens the other rear door. The new driver
gets out of the car.
    
				LIMO DRIVER (cont'd)
		Here's the key to the car. Take it
		straight to the garage. They're waiting
		for you.
    
The limo driver closes both back doors after the Castigliane
brothers are seated within. He then gets in himself and
maneuvers the big limo out into traffic.

PINK'S CHILI DOGS - DAY
    
Two guys, JOE ( the guy who killed Ed in the sixth floor
office) and BILLY another unkept, rocker type delivery man
are standing waiting for their chili dogs with a girl, LANEY,
who could be very good looking but she seems to be in poor
health. Her hair is long and stringy. She's wearing a
tight, short sleeve blue sweater, black jeans and boots.
    
				BILLY
		Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

				JOE
		No, no, no, I told you. They're fine.
		They're all real happy.

				BILLY
		My next delivery is up that way, so I'll
		be getting down to it real soon.
    

				JOE
		You're so easy.
    
				BILLY
		Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
    
				JOE
		Yeah, what for?
    
				BILLY
		Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's
		all.
    
The chili dogs arrive and they pay for them.
    
				BILLY (cont'd)
		Can we eat in the van?
    
				JOE
		What's  the matter now?
    
				BILLY
		Nothing... I don't like being out in the
		open like this.
    
				JOE
		It must be just so pathetic being you.
		Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in
		the van.
    
The three make their way to the van. Joe looks over at
Laney.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		You sure you don't want anything?
    
				LANEY
			(hesitantly)
		Not here...no thanks.
    
				JOE
		Not a coke or anything?
    
				LANEY
		No ... thanks though... I'll take a
		cigarette if you have one.
    
				JOE
		Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
    
As Laney is getting her cigarette and lighting it..

    
				JOE (cont'd)
		Any new girls on the street these days?
    
				LANEY
			(taking her first big drag)
		No.  I haven't seen any.
    
				JOE
		A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
    
				LANEY
		No...
    
				JOE
		You'll keep your eyes open for me won't
		you baby?
    
				LANEY
		Sure.
    
Joe spanks her butt as she gets in the van.

Mr. Roque, in his wheelchair is still in the center of the
huge softly lit, windowless office. His manservant standing
silently behind him. The small built-in wheelchair phone
rings. Mr. Roque pushes a button on a small intricate remote
device he holds in his right hand. A slender streamlined
microphone rises from the arm of the chair.

He listens through a high-tech earplant which we now see.

skin is pale white, almost translucent. The fingers are long
and seem slightly too large. At the ends of the fingers and
thumb are stretched tapered high gloss red fingernails which
slightly curve downward. The forefinger of the hand presses
a button on the phone. A small tone sounds - followed by a
very modern sounding coded signal.

BEVERLY HILLS CITY STREETS - DAY
    
A car - a late model generic sedan is moving toward us. Two
men dressed in suits and wearing dark glasses are driving
slowly. As they go each man is scanning sidewalks,
buildings, passing cars as if hunting for someone. They pass
by us and as we turn we leave them and pick-up Adam driving
in the opposite direction in the other lane. We stay with
Adam.
    
Adam drives his Porsche up a palm lined street.

The girls are still sitting on the leather couch as before,
but now silently off in their own worlds. After a moment...

		I wonder where you were going.
    
Betty's question hangs in the air. Slowly we move close to
Rita who is on the verge of remembering something.

    
Suddenly -

Adam pulls into his driveway, but is blocked from entering
the garage by a poolman's truck. He gets out of the car and
looks at the truck - sees the insignia on the door which is a
blue square with the word "Gene" above and the word "Clean"
below. Adam hears steps behind him and turns. A JAPANESE
GARDENER is coming toward him smiling and bowing.
    
				JAPANESE GARDENER
		Ah, Mister ... you remember me. I am Taka.

He hears a noise, something falling. He walks in the
direction of the noise. It leads him to his bedroom. His
expression darkens as he approaches the closed door. He
hears voices as he throws the door open.
    
LORRAINE and the poolman GENE are in bed.

over to the dresser and opening the top drawer. He removes a
large case.

Adam leaves the kitchen and goes out into the garage. He
turns on the light and looks around. He spots some paint
cans on a shelf and grabs one and goes back into the kitchen.
He can hear Lorraine calling his name. She seems to be
coming closer. He sets the jewelry case and the paint can on
the floor, kneels down and opens the paint can with his car
key. Just as Lorraine enters the kitchen, he opens the
jewelry box and empties the 3/4 full gallon can of Hot Pink
paint into her jewelry case.
    
				LORRAINE
		WHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???
    
He puts his hands into the paint and jewels and smushes them
about. Lorraine rushes toward him.
    
				LORRAINE (cont'd)
		STOP IT!!!
    
Lorraine grabs hold of him. Starts pulling his hair,
slapping his face. She tears his jacket. Adam stands all at
once and with his wet Hot Pink hands he pushes Lorraine and
slams her into the kitchen counter just as Gene the poolman
enters. Gene grabs ahold of Adam, cocks back and slams his
huge suntanned fist into Adam's face.
    
				GENE
		That's not a way to treat your wife,
		buddy. I don't care what she's done.
    
Adam gets up off the floor bleeding from the nose and tries
to hit Gene. Gene blocks his punch and slams Adam again,
knocking him down to the kitchen floor where he lands and
spills the jewelry case. Adam, now covered with paint, is
picked up by Gene and thrown out toward the front door.
    
				LORRAINE
		Throw him out!
    
Lorraine opens the front door while Gene picks Adam up, moves
him across the carpet and heaves him out onto the front lawn.
Lorraine slams the door behind him.
    
Adam picks himself up, severely dazed and bleeding pretty
badly, he heads for his car.

    
Taka stops gardening and smiles and bows at Adam as he gets
into his car.
    
Adam drives away - pink paint and red blood all over.

They look around the room... There's a hatbox in the closet
above the clothes rack. Betty brings it down, takes out the

excitement about life lifts Rita's spirits.
    
Coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people - a middle-
aged woman and a young boy around 10 years old. The boy is
very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking
awkwardly on crutches. As the two groups pass each other on
the sidewalk Betty is struck deeply by the boy's brilliant,
luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with
wisdom.

		No. Just the coffee.
    
				BETTY
		We'll take our check.
    
Diane searches through her many checks to find Betty and
Rita's.
    
The manager of Denny's, standing with a woman in a blue
dress, calls Diane's name. Diane turns and looks to the
manager and the woman. A fleeting fear goes through her
eyes. She surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes
out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Betty's
check as she places it on their table. She does this very
quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty
noticing. Diane walks quickly over to the manager and the
woman in the blue dress. Betty turns and watches a heated
conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in
the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then
leaving.

    
The manager says something to Diane and Diane turns her
pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the
manager showing him her innocence. He waves her off and she
goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. Betty
stops watching and turns her attention to Rita, who is tense
and lost in a thought.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(without moving a muscle)
		Shhhh.
    
At that moment Diane the waitress reappears at their table.
Diane looks Betty in the eye and while looking at Betty her
left hand slides the Mont Blanc out from under the check and
back into her pocket.
    
				DIANE
		Thank you. Come in again.
    
Betty holds her gaze.
    
				BETTY
		You're welcome. We will.
    
Relieved Diane leaves and goes about her business. Betty
looks over at Rita waiting for her to tell her something.
Rita slowly turns and focuses on Betty.

a car moving slowly up Havenhurst toward us. We notice two
men in the front seat who seem to be looking around for
something.

Betty and Rita are sitting next to each other on the leather
couch. Betty is rifling through the phone book. She finds
the listings for Selwyn. Her finger drifts down and finds D.
Selwyn followed by an address and phone number. It is the
only Selwyn with a D. first name. She hands the phone to
Rita.
    
				BETTY
		Strange to be calling yourself.
    
				RITA
		Maybe it's not me.
    
				BETTY
		Call the number.
    
Betty reads the number off and Rita pushes the corresponding
buttons. Each tone seems to be louder than the last. The
ringing seems deafening. There's a click and the phone is
answered - by a machine. A woman's voice is heard - loudly.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(coming from answering machine)
		Hi ... this is me. Leave me a message.
    
Betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also -
straining to hear everything. The machine starts recording.
Betty hangs up the phone immediately.
    
				RITA
		It's not my voice ... but I know her.
    
				BETTY
		Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn.
		Maybe that's your roommate or if it is

Taka is bowing and smiling and nodding to someone we don't
see.
    
TAKA'S POV - A man, KENNY, in a sharp black suit is walking
down the driveway past Gene the Poolman's truck to the front
door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo
with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back.
    
Kenny knocks on Adam's front door. Lorraine answers.
Lorraine's hands are covered with pink paint. Pink paint is
on her face and clothes.
    
				KENNY
		Adam Kesher...he...
    
				LORRAINE
		Yeah, right ... get lost!
    
She slams the door, but Kenny's foot stops it and pushes it
back with a force that shakes the wall as the door slams open
once again. Kenny enters the house.
    
				KENNY
		This is Adam Kesher's house. Where...
    
				LORRAINE
		Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!!
    
Gene comes out of the kitchen fast, his hands covered with
pink paint.
    
				GENE
		I guess you don't understand English.
		She asked to leave. Here's the door.
    
Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door.
Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for
his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back
up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to
the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there.
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor.

    
And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink
water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box -
spilling out onto the kitchen floor. Finishing his work with
the vintage golf clubs - Kenny leaves.

		I'm her niece. She's letting me stay

Coco comes up and grabs hold of Louise. She turns over to
Betty.
    
				COCO
		This is Louise Bonner. I'm sure she
		meant well.
			(looking over to Louise)
		This is Betty, Ruth's niece. In fact and

		How...  how'd they know I was here?

		So, what did they say?

		Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're

		Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea

		Something tells me this guy is connected

		Cynthia...what's going on?

		It's been a very strange day.

		And getting stranger. Where do I meet

		Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the

		Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day.

		I'm just offering a place to stay.

Adam, in his Porsche, makes his way up the canyon.
    
INT. PORSCHE
    
Adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon
road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area
gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a
dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in
a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral.
His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No
one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling
stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from
the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the
brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light
is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled
unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red
embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string
tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The
Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front
of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl.
    
				COWBOY
		Howdy!
    
				ADAM
		Howdy to you.

    
				COWBOY
		Beautiful night.
    
				ADAM
		Yeah.
    
				COWBOY
		Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the
		way up to see me from that Beverly Hills
		Hotel.

				ADAM
		No problem. What's on your mind?
    
				COWBOY
		Well now, here's a man who wants to get
		right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it
		are ya?
    
				ADAM
		Whatever.
    
				COWBOY
		A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes
		some ways toward how a man's life will
		be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
    
				ADAM
		Sure.
    
				COWBOY
		Now... did you answer cause you thought
		that's what I wanted to hear or did you
		think about what I said and answer cause
		you truly believe that to be right?
    
				ADAM
		I agree with what you said...truly.
    
				COWBOY
		What did I say?
    
				ADAM
		That a man's attitude determines to a
		large extent how his life will be.
    
				COWBOY
		So since you agree I guess you could be a
		person who does not care about the good
		life.
    
				ADAM
		How's that?

    
				COWBOY
		Well, just stop for a little second and
		think about it. Will ya do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Okay, I'm thinking.
    
				COWBOY
		No. You're too busy being a smart aleck
		to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think
		and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya
		do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Look ... where's this going? What do you
		want me to do?
    
				COWBOY
		There's sometimes a buggy. How many
		drivers does a buggy have?
    
				ADAM
		One.
    
				COWBOY
		So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy
		and you fix your attitude and you can
		ride along with me.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
				COWBOY
		Now I know a few things. I know you have
		had a rough day. You're probably thinkin'
		I don't know the half of it, but in
		actual fact I know every part of it. The
		business of gittin' thrown off your
		movie, the heartache of seeing your wife
		with another man... losin' access to that
		precious film vault...
    
Adam suddenly looks stunned, unsure.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		... realizin' you don't have hardly a
		nickel to your name and then add on to
		that the sickenin' feeling some men are
		gonna catch you and hurt you bad for
		bustin' their vehicle. Some days are like
		that. They are rough, but what will
		tomorrow bring? Will it be better than
		today? The same ... or worse?
		A lot of that is up to us individually.
		Up to us and our attitude. When the
		Castigliane brothers said "This is no
		longer your film," they meant it, but
		they didn't mean you were not going to
		direct it. I want you to go back to work
		tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead
		actress anyway ... audition many girls for
		the part. When you see the girl that was
		shown to you earlier today, you will say
		" This is the girl." The rest of the
		cast can stay- that is up to you, but
		that lead girl is not up to you. Now,
		you will see me one more time if you do
		good. You will see me two more times if
		you do bad. Good night.
    
The Cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness.
Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door
opening and closing, then another opening and closing and
then the sound of the car driving away. Adam walks up in the
direction the Cowboy took, but he sees no sign of a car nor
any dust nor any road. He goes back down past the barn and
stables to his car. There standing by his Porsche is the
Cowboy.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		You thinkin' this'll work out, cause I
		was thinkin' it just might.
    
				ADAM
		It will work out.
    
				COWBOY
		Good then, but, just in case, that bank's
		gonna stay closed a bit longer. You
		understand that?
    
				ADAM
		I understand.
    
				COWBOY
		You're an understandin' fella.
    
				ADAM
		So, this is the last time I see you then
		unless I do bad?
    
				COWBOY
		No, this one doesn't count. It's part of
		the original one. So then ... until we meet
		again.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
Adam gets in his car and drives off leaving the Cowboy
smiling behind him.

		it comes from a good place. I'll trust

		against Ruth. She's got enough to worry
		about up there in Canada. If she asks-
		I'm going to say everything is okay, and
		you make sure it is.

			Betty's shoulder and squeezes
			it)
		If you need any help you know where to
		find me.
    
Betty puts her hand on Coco's shoulder and gives her a
squeeze.
    
				BETTY
		You're really something Coco...thank you.

				COCO
		Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise
		Bonner says there's trouble in there.
		You remember last night. Sometimes she's
		wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid
		of it.

    
Coco turns and walks away. Betty studies her and thinks
about what she said before turning and going back inside.

INT. HOLLYWOOD POLICE STATION - DAY
    
Detective Neal Domgaard throws two wallets down on the desk
in front of Detective Harry McKnight. Harry pauses in the
middle of a large bite of grilled cheese sandwich with bacon
and tomato. He looks down and studies the wallets.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
			(biting in and chewing)
		Nice wallets.
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony
		credit cards ... off the two guys in the
		Caddy.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		The one of 'em still alive?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You
		remember Dr.Scott.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Oh yeah.

    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Well he said...  you know in his way... you
		know what I mean? Besides the guy
		gettin' rolled up under the kids car
		which busted him up pretty bad, there was
		this little knife-like torn piece of
		metal, you know, off the car body, rolled
		out and slid up through this guy's neck
		and just kinda slit his aorta, you know,
		but they didn't find it right away, so
		the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you
		know, to the brain - all this time cause
		it was just like this thin little
		puncture wound on the surface of his neck
		that kinda sealed itself, he said, while
		inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty
		steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's
		laughin' you know like he does 'cause he
		knows we want to talk to this guy. He's
		laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a
		bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was
		kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we
		were all laughin'...the nurse was
		laughin'. You know how he is.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Find out who they are?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't
		match up anywhere.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
			(another big bite - chewing)
		Interesting.
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Yeah ... and they both use the same

Betty is coming out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. She calls
back in to Rita.
    
				BETTY
		I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.
		Don't drink all the coke.

				RITA
		Good luck!

		When I get back I'll have the cab

				RITA
		Okay.
    
Betty closes the door and heads across the courtyard. She
knocks on Coco's door and in a moment Coco answers.
    
				BETTY
		Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
    
				COCO
		It's all right gorgeous. Something
		wrong?
    
				BETTY
		No, no. I'm on my way to my audition.
		Before I go I wanted to ask you if you
		could remember the man's name ... Aunt
		Ruthie's friend who helped put this
		together. It completely went out of my
		mind.
    
				COCO
		His name's Wally Brown .... great guy.
		Been in the business since forever.
    
				BETTY
		Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
    
				COCO
		Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give
		him a good performance and he'll be happy
		and I've got a feeling you'll do just
		that.
    
				BETTY
		Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.

    
				COCO
		Get going. You don't want to be late.
    
				BETTY
		Right. See ya.

The cab pulls up to the gate. Betty pays the driver and gets
out. She-stands for a moment staring at a dream.
    
She walks through the gate and as she goes is stopped by a
PARAMOUNT GUARD.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		And where do we think we're going, Miss?
    
Betty stops and turns.
    
				BETTY
		To my audition.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		And who are we auditioning for today?
    
				BETTY
		Wally Brown.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		And do we know which of the fifty-seven
		buildings Wally Brown is in?
    
				BETTY
			(smiling)
		No, we don't.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		Well, now we've got to figure that out
		first don't we?
    
				BETTY
		Yes, Sir.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive
		Building on the second floor. We want to
		go in and turn right at the first street.
		Then we want to walk three blocks down
		past Stage 17 to the white Executive
		Building. Once we're on the second floor
		the receptionist will take us from there.
		Now do we have name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty Elms.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		Let's see if we have a pass for Betty
		Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good

				BETTY
		Thank you... thank you very much.

INT.   EXECUTIVE BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
    
Betty finishes climbing some stairs and crosses to the
receptionist. She hands over her pass. The receptionist
looks at it, hands it back to Betty and points down the hall
to her left.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Number 43, on the left.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you.
    
Betty walks down the long corridor past several offices. The
door to office 43 is open when she arrives and she enters a
large sitting room with a receptionist at a desk off to one
side.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		May I help you?

    
				BETTY
		My name is Betty Elms. I'm here to
		audition for... Mr. Brown
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Good. Perfect timing. Have a seat and
		I'll get Mr. Brown.
    
The receptionist stands, walks to a door, knocks twice, then
enters.
    
She closes the door behind her and Betty is alone in the
sitting room. She sits on a couch and looks at the old
movie posters covering all four walls.
    
In a moment the same door opens again and an elderly,
distinguished looking gentleman WALLY BROWN comes out
smiling. Betty stands up immediately.
    
				WALLY
		Betty Elms?
    
				BETTY
		Yes.
    
				WALLY
		I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear
		friend of mine so it's particularly nice
		to meet you.
    
				BETTY
		Very pleased to meet you.

				WALLY
		Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
    
As they walk into Wally's office...
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		I took the liberty of inviting an extra
		person to see your audition. She saw
		your resume picture and was very
		interested in meeting you.
    
Inside Wally's office several people rise out of chairs when
Wally enters with Betty.
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		Betty Elms this is Jack Taft, my
		assistant, Jimmy Katz who we've already
		cast for the part of "Chuck". He'll be
		doing the scene with you.
		This is Julie Chadwick and Bob Brooker,
		the director, and our surprise guest is
		Sarah James. We couldn't afford her to
		cast our picture, but as casting agents
		go she's the best.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Why thank you, Wally. Hello Betty.
    
She and Betty shake hands.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		This is Nicki, my assistant.
    
Nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat-eyed glasses
nods coolly to Betty.
    
				WALLY
		And this is Martha, Martha Johnson, who
		you met out front.
    
Betty nervously smiles to the room.
    
				BETTY
		Hi.
    
				WALLY
		Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like
		a water or a coffee before we begin?
    
Betty's hands are beginning to sweat.
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I'm fine.
    
				WALLY
		Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty
		why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play
		the scene. Is there anything you'd like
		to say Bob... something to Betty before
		they begin?
    
Betty stops on her way across to Jimmy and looks to Bob the
director.
    
				BOB
		No ... it's not a contest, see, the two of
		them with themselves, so don't play it
		for real until it gets real.

    
Betty doesn't know what to say. She catches Sarah's
assistant, Nicki, rolling her eyes.
    
				BETTY
		Okay.
    
Betty continues walking toward Jimmy who opens his arms to
her as she approaches. He's old enough to be her father.
    
				JIMMY
		Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
    
				BETTY
		What?
    
				JIMMY
		I want to play this one close, Bob. Like
		it was with that girl, what's her name,
		with the black hair. That felt good.
		Whaddya think?
    
Betty looks from Jimmy to Bob.
    
				BOB
		That'd be good, Jimmy. Just don't rush
		that line again. I told you... the line
		where you say, "Before what?"
    
				JIMMY
		I was playin' off 'em. They say,
		"They'll arrest you"... and stuff like
		that.. "put you in jail"... they say it
		like that. They all say it the same way,
		so I react like that.
    
Jimmy turns to Betty.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Look ... what's your name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I
		don't rush it. We play it close, just
		like in the movies.
    
Jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around Betty and brings
her in against his pot belly.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Dad's best friend goes to work.

    
Jimmy smiles as he brings Betty a little closer. She is
trying to concentrate through the nervousness and Jimmy's
breath. There is a silence as Jimmy looks her in the eyes.
Everyone in the room is looking Betty in the eyes.
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		And ... ACTION!
    
Betty and Jimmy start the scene. It is very difficult for
Betty as Jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.
    
				BETTY
		You're still here?
    
				JIMMY
		I came back. I thought that's what you
		wanted.
    
Jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. He gives the
last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
    
				BETTY
		Nobody wants you here.
    
Betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from
Jimmy. Jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.
    
				JIMMY
		Really?
    
Betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.
    
				BETTY
		My parents are right upstairs! They
		think you've left.
    
Jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		So ... surprise!
    
Betty pushes him back.
    
				BETTY
		I can call them... I can call my dad.
    
				JIMMY
		But you won't.

    
He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty
looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand.
She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy
lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently
pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
She's surprising herself.
    
				BETTY
			(almost a hot whisper)
		You're playing a dangerous game here. if
		you're trying to blackmail me... it's not
		going to work.
    
Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		You know what I want...it's not that
		difficult.
    
Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now
and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close
to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering desperately -
			slowly)
		Get out... Get out before I call my dad.
		He trusts you... you're his best friend.
			(her arms go around him)
		This will be the end of everything.
    
Jimmy gets lost. He doesn't know where he is anymore. He
can only see Betty's eyes.
    
				JIMMY
		What about you? What will your dad think
		about you?
    
Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
    
				BETTY
		Stop... just stop! That's what you said
		from the beginning. If I tell what
		happened... they'll arrest you and put
		you in jail, so get out of here before...
    
				JIMMY
			(caught by her transfixing,
			sultry eyes, and almost
			breathless ... he finds himself
			taking an extra long pause)
		Before what?
    
As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back, but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss.
    
				BETTY
			(as she kisses him - whispers)
		Before I kill you.
    
Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He
finally is able to say his line.
    
				JIMMY
		Then they'd put you in jail.
    
As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her
cheeks. She backs away.
    
				BETTY
		I hate you... I hate us both!
    
She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.
    
Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty, but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance. Sarah turns to Nicki.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		I'm going to take her over there.
    
				NICKI
		Big time!
    
				WALLY
			(to everyone)
		Wow!
    
Betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself.
    
				BETTY
		Well, there it was.

    
				JIMMY
		There it was it was! Baby, you got a
		way!
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		Very good. Really. I mean it was forced
		maybe but still humanistic. Yeah, very
		good, really.
    
				WALLY
		Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that.
		That was very impressive. You've done
		your Aunt proud and I'm going to tell her
		the first chance I get. We'll speak again
		soon I'm sure, and thank you so much for
		coming in.
    
				BETTY
		Well, thank you.
    
Betty doesn't quite know what to do. She moves to the center
of the room and just stands. Remnants of the scene still
staying with her.
    
Sarah stands and Nicki stands just after.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Thank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a
		lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.
    
				WALLY
		Well, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah,
		and don't you be a stranger. We'd love to
		see you around here again real soon.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Well come along, Betty.
    
Sarah takes Betty's hand and they go to the door. Betty turns
back once more and smiles.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice
		meeting all of you.
    
Everyone nods and waves and Betty is taken out by Sarah and
Nicki.

her face.
    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		Oh, not you Betty. You were stellar and
		I mean that, but poor Wally. He'll never

		Oh god! Jimmy Katz never had a day.

Betty finds herself getting a little upset.
    
				BETTY
		They seem very nice to me, and

				SARAH JAMES
		Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong.

Betty does another shocked head turn.

		And I love actors, all actors, Jimmy Katz

		sometimes. Now we want to take you across

INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde
girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are
three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male
vocalists backing her up flawlessly.

We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher
surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people
standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and
bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring
Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard
mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The
song continues to play over.

As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on
the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty
turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of
the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
song.

				ADAM
			(calling out through an
			electronic megaphone)
		Cut it!
    
He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the
blonde girl. He shakes her hand.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Thank you very much, Carol. It was really
		great of you to come in. I know how busy
		you are.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this
		script! Where do I sign?

    
				ADAM
		Look... I love you, but there's no way
		they're gonna let me cast this thing
		until I've seen everyone. I'll let you
		know as soon as I can.
    
				CAROL
		I know you will ... cause my manager's
		gonna bug you day and night ... me too.
    
				ADAM
		It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of
		here.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget
		me. I'm the girl that's going to play
		this part.
    
				ADAM
			(lightly pinching her cheek)
		See ya later.
    
Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.
He looks around. He sees Betty being introduced by Sarah to
some of the studio executives. He goes over to his Assistant
Director and looks down at the man's notepad.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Who's next, Hank?
    
				HANK
		Camilla Rhodes.
    
Adam wonders - worries.
    
				ADAM
		Is she ready?
    
				HANK
		All ready.
    
				ADAM
		Bring her out.
    
Hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. The sound of his
voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.
    
				HANK
			(through walkie-talkie)
		Camilla Rhodes next!

    
Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up
singers step in behind her.
    
Adam nods to Hank.
    
				HANK (cont'd)
		Turn over!
    
The cameraman calls out, "Speed".
    
				ADAM
			(through megaphone)
		Playback!
    
Countdown before the music begins.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		ACTION!
    
The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing.
    
On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers.
This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment.
She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and
pulls Hank over to him.
    
				HANK
		Yeah?
    
Adam pauses.
    
				ADAM
		Get Jason over here.
    
Hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
    
				HANK
		Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
    
Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN,
a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but
Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's
gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam.
Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how
much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
    
				JASON
		Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

    
				ADAM
		This is the girl!
    
At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side.
He smiles at Adam.
    
				RAY
		Excellent choice, Adam.
    
Adam is sick with himself.
    
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.
    
				BETTY
		Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I
		promised a friend.
    
She quickly shakes Sarah's and Nicki's hands saying, "I'm
sorry, I'm sorry" and runs off like Cinderella.
    
Adam turns and sees her running off out of his world.
    
Chris Isaak's song "Except The New Girl" segues in over
Connie Stevens and plays as Adam, Sarah and Nicki watch Betty
disappear out the sound stage door.
    
							CUT TO:

COURTYARD - 1612 HAVENHURST DAY
    
Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.
    
Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is
laughing, pulling on Rita.
    
				BETTY
		C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.
    
Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.

    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Hey!

    
Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT (cont'd)
		Hey, how's Sol?
    
				BETTY
		Sol?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		No ... not you...
			(to Rita)
		I'm sorry... I forget your name.
    
				RITA
			(almost inaudible)
		Rita.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately.
		Tell him to come by the club.
    
Rita nods ... biting her lip. Cornell smiles and picks up his
sax.
    
				BETTY
		And what's your name?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
			(big smile)
		Cornell Dumont.
    
He begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering)
		Ask him who Sol is ...
    
Rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe he could help...
    
Betty follows Rita through the gate to the waiting cab. They
get in and the cab pulls away.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. CAB - DAY
    
Betty reaches and gently grabs Rita's shoulder. She speaks
firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear.

    
				BETTY
		Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
    
				RITA
			(whispering back)
		But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of
		Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why
		we shouldn't go see about Diane
		Selwyn... it's better not to get in
		trouble.
    
				BETTY
		You're not going to get in trouble.
		You're going to find out who you are.
		Finding out who you are gets you out of
		trouble.
    
Rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and
doubt all over again.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
INT. CAB - LATER
    
Betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand.
She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides
of the street.
    
				BETTY
		It should be around here...
    
Rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
Sierra Bonita. They near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation. A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(points)
		That's it ... 2590.
			(nudging Rita)
		Does it look familiar?
    
Rita shakes her head..no. Rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590. She discerns two men
sitting in the front.
    
				RITA
		Don't stop!
    
				BETTY
		What is it? What do you see?!
    
				RITA
			(quietly - frantic)
		Those men in front, in the car.
    
				BETTY
		Do you know them?!
    
				RITA
		No... but...
    
				BETTY
			(to driver)
		Keep going. Go around to the back.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. SIERRA BONITA APARTMENT - BACK ALLEY - DAY
    
Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then
drives away. The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list.
    
				BETTY
		Selwyn ... number 12.
    
They both look around the various doors near them. Betty
spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10
through #20.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		It's this way.
    
They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley. Standing in the alley is
a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
    
Both girls dive for the bushes.
    
The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion. Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(panting whisper)
		Now, you've got me scared.
    
Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left.
    

He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand
up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		See, I told you there was nothing to be
		afraid of!
    
They go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door.
    
				RITA
		Oh no ... don't.
    
Betty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the
door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks
again harder. They wait.
    
				RITA (cont'd)
		No one's ...
    
Suddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Yes?
    
				BETTY
		Diane?
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Number 17.
    
				BETTY
		But it said #12.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		I switched apartments with her. She's in
		#17. Just walk down that way. It's just
		to the right.
    
The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		It's kind of hidden by the foliage.
    
Betty and Rita start to leave.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		She hasn't been around for a few days ...

    
				BETTY
		Well ... we'll leave her a note.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
			(starting toward them)
		I'll go with you. She's still got some of
		my stuff.
    
The phone rings from inside her bungalow.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
			(turning back)
		Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that.
    
The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.
    
				BETTY
		I guess you're not Diane.
    
Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
    
They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
answer. She knocks again.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Still not home I guess.
    
The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries
to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens.
    
				RITA
		I don't think...
    
				BETTY
			(looking around for anyone
			watching)
		C'mon help me in. I'll open the front
		door.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head
through the open window.
    
				BETTY
		PUSH!!!

    
Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in. As she closes the
window ...
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Meet you at the door.
    
Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it. Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I don't know if you want to come in here
		or not. There's some kind of horrible
		smell like... something...
    
Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. - BUNGALOW #17 - DAY
    
Betty begins to go through the bungalow and Rita follows.
All the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn. They move
slowly, looking around at everything as they go. Betty looks
to Rita to see if any of this is something she remembers.
Rita looks as though she's walking in a trance. Through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. SIERRA BONITA APARTMENTS - BUNGALOW #12 - DAY
    
The Middle-Aged Woman is just shutting the door to her
bungalow. She walks quickly in the direction of Bungalow
#17.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. - BUNGALOW #17 - DAY
    
Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor. They pass a
small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up
table. They move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed. Betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own. They enter the room and stop cold. A scream
starts to build inside Rita. Before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The
scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look
closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to
leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and
brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.
    
In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. Betty
freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth, but she can't stop Rita's violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. BUNGALOW #17 - DAY
    
The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door, looking
around at bungalow #17. She's not sure if she has heard
something or not. She wonders, then turns and goes back to
her bungalow.
    
Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies
open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.
    
Sounds, churning music.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY
    
Sounds, music churning continues.
    
Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends
over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a
frenzy. There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair. Betty's is rushing to her -
her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for Rita's hand holding
the scissors. She keeps her from cutting and moves closer,
whispering in Rita's ear. Rita can't stop crying, but lets
Betty hold her. Music changes ...
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I know what you're doing.
    
				RITA
			(through uncontrollable sobs)
		What ... I..HAVE... to do.
    
				BETTY
		I know what you have to do, but let me do
		it.
    
Rita turns and looks up at Betty, her eyes red with crying.
Betty pulls her up facing her. Rita lets Betty take the
scissors. They look into each other's eyes. Betty gently
strokes Rita's cheek, wiping away some tears.

    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Let me do it.

Panning slowly across we see on the bathroom counter various
open bottles, used Q-tips, towels, combs, a brush, a bowl,
and lots of long strands of cut black hair. We continue
moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds. The
reflection of the new Rita moves into the mirror. She has
short, beautiful blonde hair, blonde eyebrows and no make-up.
Betty's reflection comes in beside Rita's. They stare at the
new Rita in the mirror.
    
				BETTY
			(quietly with assurance)
		You look like someone else.

EXT. COURTYARD 1612 HAVENHURST - LATE EVENING - ALMOST
DARK
    
We move off the door of Aunt Ruth's apartment and crane
slowly up to the apartment above hers - WILKINS - the one
with the wayward dog. We move closer to Wilkins' apartment
and as we move in we hear a phone ringing.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
INT. WILKINS' APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
    
Wilkins still in his pajamas, bathrobe and slippers from
morning slouches in an enormous stuffed chair and matching
ottoman, surrounded by piles of papers and coffee cups. His
Jack Russell Terrier wakes and stands at the sound of the
phone ringing on a side table next to Wilkins. Wilkins comes
out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange, matted tufts of dirty blonde hair.
    
				WILKINS
		Hello. Adam. How's it going? No, it's
		okay. Yeah, I'm working, but... they
		wanted this script a week ago. What?
		What's wrong with your house? The
		poolman? Sure, you can have the couch.
		No, it's no problem..it's just I
		gotta ... I gotta work. Any chance you
		could bring some food. No, I got plenty
		of money - I just haven't gone out for
		awhile. Groovy man!

    
				WILKINS (cont'd)
		Murphy and I'll be glad to see you. No,
		no, no, he's got plenty of food.

INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
    
Rita has just taken the hatbox from the closet shelf and is
setting it on the bed.
    
				BETTY
		What are you doing?
    
Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox
and removes her purse. She opens the purse and takes out the
money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the
money she thinks of what to say.
    
				RITA
		You've been so good to me ... now we know
		why ... why I was so afraid. We know what
		kind of trouble I'm in. I shouldn't...
		ask you... I only have this to offer.
		I'll give you this if I can stay here for
		awhile. I don't know what else to do.
    
Betty moves across the bed to the side of Rita. She puts her
arm around Rita and holds her.
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I want you to stay here and you
		don't have to give me that money.
    
				RITA
		But I want to.
    
				BETTY
		No. We shouldn't touch that money. We
		don't know about that money. That might
		be dangerous money. You have to start all
		over again. You look like a brand new
		person and you can be a brand new
		person... whoever you want to be.
    
				RITA
		It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody
		brand new.
    
				BETTY
		Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to
		Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof
		garden yet.

EXT.  COURTYARD -  NIGHT
    
The girls come out the front door ... Betty leading and pulling
a much happier Rita along with her. They half run across the
courtyard to stone steps under an Ivy covered eave.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. ROOF GARDEN - NIGHT
    
The girls race up the stone steps toward us. Soon their wind-
blown, smiling faces fill the screen as they look out. There
before them are the lights of Hollywood with silhouetted
palms, slow-moving theater kleig lights, and floating above
it all the giant sign in the hills reading HOLLYWOOD.
    
				BETTY
		Here I am Hollywood! My name's Betty.
    
A pause.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(to Rita)
		Say it!
    
				RITA
		Here I am Hollywood! My name is ... Rita.
    
They look out, maybe waiting for an answer blowing in the
Santa Ana wind.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER
    
We move in to the pile of money next to Rita's purse. Past
that we move down inside Rita's purse. We see the Blue Key
and move closer to it until it fills the screen.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
    
We drift along the red bricks past the payphone, along the
wall until we come to the corner. Slowly we round the corner
and move to a dark alley. There amongst the dumpsters and
trash cans is the dark silhouette of a figure. We move closer
to the figure. It is the bum and the bum sits. We move
closer and the bum's face fills the screen. It's face is
black with fungus. It's eyes turn and they seem to be red.

     The sound of electronic music rises, hollow, metallic.

     FADE IN on a long TRACKING SHOT through the universe.  As the NARRATOR
     speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from
     the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within
     a maze of suns.

                                   NARRATOR
                              (over)
                    It is the mid 22nd Century.  Mankind
                    has explored the boundaries of his
                    own solar system, and now he reaches
                    out to the endless interstellar
                    distances of the universe.  He moves
                    away from his own small planetary
                    system in huge hyperdrive starships:
                    computer-driven, self-supporting,
                    closed-system spacecraft that travel
                    at mind-staggering post-light
                    velocities.  Man has begun to spread
                    among the stars.  Enormous ships
                    embark with generations of colonists
                    searching the depths of space for
                    new earths, now homes, new
                    beginnings.  Far in advance of these
                    colony ships goes a new pioneer: the
                    scouts, the pathfinders, a special
                    breed of man who has dedicated his
                    life to blazing the trail through
                    the most distant, unexplored
                    galaxies, opening up the farthest
                    frontiers of space.  These are the
                    men of the Advance Exploration
                    Corps.  The task they face is one of
                    unbelievable isolation and
                    loneliness.  So far from home that
                    Earth is no longer even a point of
                    light in the sky, they must comb the
                    universe for those unstable planets
                    whose existence poses a threat to
                    the peaceful colonists that follow.
                    They must find these rogue planets
                    -- and destroy them.  Among these
                    commandos are the men of the
                    scoutship <u>Dark Star</u>.

     We are now moving toward a planet.  Floating in front of the planet is
     the SCOUTSHIP DARK STAR.  As we move toward the ship, we begin to hear
     VOICES, crackling with static.

                    Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a
                    minute.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK along the length of the control room,
     revealing three men: BOILER, DOOLITTLE, and PINBACK.  They are seated
     close together in cramped little chairs, surrounded by a maze of
     instrumentation, pressing buttons, making adjustments and corrections.
     There is one EMPTY CHAIR; the panel in front of it looks burned.

                                   PINBACK
                    I need a GHF reading on the gravity
                    correction.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I'll check it.

                                   BOILER
                    I have a reduced drive reading of
                    seven thousand.

                                   PINBACK
                    Right, that checks out here.

                    Yes, Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    In a second.

                                   PINBACK
                    Boiler, can you set me up with some
                    temp figures?

                                   BOILER
                    Ninety seven million, minus eight,

                                   PINBACK
                    I read that with a quantum increase
                    of seven.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Pinback, I have a computer reading
                    of nine five seven seven.

                                   BOILER
                    Time to start talking.

     Pinback hits a button on his panel.

     <u>INTERIOR - BOMB BAY</u>

     The screen is BLACK for an instant.  Then, two enormous doors begin to
     open ponderously, revealing the planet rotating below.  A huge BOMB,
     designated with a giant <u>#19</u> on its side, lowers slowly out of the
     ship on a rack.

                                   NARRATOR
                              (over)
                    This is a chain-reaction bomb,
                    otherwise known as an Exponential
                    Thermostellar Device.  Its own
                    destructive power is small, barely
                    enough to vaporize twelve city
                    blocks.  However, when it explodes in
                    contact with an object the size of a
                    planet, it starts a chain-reaction
                    in the very matter of that planet,
                    turning it into a giant reactor
                    which destroys itself in one
                    staggering thermal flash.

                    These bombs are equipped with
                    sophisticated thought and speech
                    mechanisms, to allow them to make
                    executive decisions in the event of
                    a crisis situation.  These judgment
                    centers are controlled by a fail-
                    safe mechanism.

                    Bomb #19 to Sergeant Pinback, I read
                    you.  Continue.

     When the bomb speaks, it has the prim, fussy voice of a minor civil
     servant.

     Pinback hits the hyperdrive switch.  Force fields energize around the

     <u>EXTERIOR - THE SHIP</u>

     The DARK STAR accelerates into hyperdrive and streaks away through
     space.

     The planetary system recedes in the background.  Inside the Observation
     Dome, Talby is frozen in a protective force field.

     INSERT: CLOSE SHOT OF A TIME CLOCK.  It blips down to ZERO.

     <u>RETURN TO SCENE</u>

     Behind the ship, there is an intense flare of light as the planet, now
     a dot of light, explodes.

     <u>INTERIOR - OBSERVATION DOME</u>

     The force field around Talby disappears as the ship comes out of
     hyperdrive.  He rubs his eyes as though awakening, then looks down at
     his readout panels.

     INSERT - CLOSE SHOT OF A PANEL.  On a small screen we see the exploding
     planet, and below, a readout says:

                                   BOILER
                    Hey, Doolittle, here's one.  An
                    unstable planet.  85% probability of
                    an unstable planet in the Veil
                    Nebula that will probably go off its
                    orbit and hit a star.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Sounds good.  Chart a course for the
                    Veil Nebula.

                                   BOILER
                    Pinback, throw me the chart log.

     Pinback draws a loose-leaf notebook from a shelf above Commander
     Powell's empty seat, and hurls it at Boiler.  With a sour look at
     Pinback, Boiler picks up the notebook and begins to leaf through it.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Let's have some music in here,
                    Boiler.

     Boiler presses a button.  LOUD COUNTRY MUSIC THEME BEGINS TO PLAY.

     <u>EXTERIOR - DARK STAR (TITLE SEQUENCE)</u>

     This sequence includes shots of the DARK STAR drifting through space,
     past various cosmic wonders, intercut with shots of the men relaxing
     (Talby staring into space; Boiler trimming his beard; Doolittle
     playing solitaire; Pinback reading a comic book).

     CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER.

     SEQUENCE ENDS.

     <u>INTERIOR - DARK STAR</u>

     Beep.

     We are watching a filmed tape.  Doolittle has just turned it on and is
     staring into the camera.  Crosshairs and blipping numbers superimposed.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Ship's log, entry number 1,943.
                    <u>Dark Star</u> cruising at light speed
                    through Sector Theta 990.  En route
                    to Veil Nebula for destruction of
                    unstable planet.  Our ETA is 1700
                    hours.
                              (thinks)
                    Ship's systems continue to
                    deteriorate...

     Pinback leans into view and whispers into Doolittle's ear.  Doolittle
     nods and Pinback withdraws.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    The short circuit in the rear seat
                    panel which killed Commander Powell
                    continues to be faulty.
                              (thinks)
                    Uh... Storage Area 9...

     Pinback leans back in and whispers emphatically.  Doolittle looks put-
     upon.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    And because he's sitting next to it,
                    it continues to bother Pinback.
                              (glares at Pinback.
                              Then:)
                    Storage Area 9 self-destructed last
                    week, destroying entire ship's
                    supply of toilet paper.  That's all.

     Beep.

     <u>INTERIOR - OBSERVATION DOME</u>

     Talby is still gazing around at the stars.

     A hatch opens in the floor and Doolittle sticks his head up.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Talby.

     Talby rotates his seat and looks down at Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    Here's some breakfast.

     Doolittle climbs into the dome and sits on the floor.  He hands Talby
     the food package, and watches matter-of-factly as Talby begins to eat.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    You know, Talby, you really ought to
                    eat with the rest of us.  You spend
                    too much time up here.

                                   TALBY
                    I like it up here.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Must get lonely being up here so
                    much.

                                   TALBY
                    I don't like to go below since
                    Commander Powell died.  I feel
                    enclosed down there.  If it were big
                    enough, I'd sleep up here...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    ... Should spend some time below, see
                    more of the rest of the ship...

                                   TALBY
                    ... You see, I can watch things up
                    here, Doolittle.  I love to watch
                    things, just stare at the planets
                    and meteors and asteroids, gas
                    clusters...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You'll have plenty of time for that,
                    you know.  Figure it this way: twenty
                    years in space and we've only aged
                    three, so there'll be plenty of time
                    to stare around...

                                   TALBY
                    You know, Doollttle, if we're going
                    into the Veil Nebula, we may
                    actually find a strange and
                    beautiful thing: the Phoenix
                    Asteroids.  They should be passing
                    through there about now...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Phoenix Asteroids?  Never heard of
                    'em.

                                   TALBY
                    They are a body of asteroids that
                    make a complete circuit of the
                    universe once every 12.3 trillion
                    years.  The Phoenix Asteroids... From
                    what I've heard, Doolittle, they
                    glow... glow with all the colors of
                    the rainbow.  Nobody knows why.  They
                    just glow as they drift around the
                    universe.  Imagine all the sights
                    they've seen in the time they've
                    been travelling -- the birth and
                    death of stars, things we'll never
                    see.  The universe is alive,
                    Doolittle.  I thought it was all
                    empty, but it isn't.  In between the
                    stars, it's seething with light and
                    gasses and dust.  There are little
                    pebbles drifting around, planets no
                    one on Earth has ever seen... No one
                    but the Phoenix Asteroids...

     There is a BLIPPING SOUND.  It is insistent.  Talby is rudely yanked
     from his reverie.  He looks down at a panel.  But his soft talk has
     started Doolittle reminiscing.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You know what I think about, Talby?

                                   TALBY
                    I'm getting something here, on this
                    readout...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    It's funny, but I kind of sit
                    around, you know, a lot of time to
                    myself...

                                   TALBY
                    I think I'm getting a malfunction
                    here somewhere.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I can't talk to the others, but with
                    time to myself, I think about back
                    home, back home at Malibu.  I used to
                    surf a lot, Talby.  I used to be a
                    great surfer.

                                   TALBY
                    Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a
                    definite malfunction on one of the
                    closed-circuit computer systems...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    The waves at Malibu and Zuma were
                    fantastic in the springs Talby.  I
                    can remember running out on the
                    beach early spring mornings with my
                    board and a wet suit...

                                   TALBY
                    I can't seem to locate the
                    malfunction exactly...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Waves would be peaking really high
                    and glassy.  Hit that water.  Ridin'
                    the wall just perfect.

                                   TALBY
                    ... Somewhere in the autonomic relay
                    circuits...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I guess I miss the waves and my
                    board most of all.

     Talby turns in his seat and addresses Doolittle directly.

                                   TALBY
                    Ah, Doolittle, I do have a
                    malfunction on this readout, but I
                    can't seem to pinpoint exactly where
                    it is.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (snapped out of his
                              daydream)
                    Don't worry about it.  We'll find out
                    when it goes bad.

                                   TALBY
                              (chagrined)
                    I really think I should try and
                    locate it immediately.  Might be
                    something important.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I wish I had my board with me now.
                    Even if I could only polish it once
                    in awhile.

                                   BOILER
                    I'm not sure.  I think something is
                    fucked up somewhere in the ship,
                    though.

                                   PINBACK
                    I hope it's not the oven again.

     The Control Room is EMPTY.  After a moment, there is a repetitive BEEP.

     CLOSE SHOT - TV SCREEN.  On the screen is the message:

     This fades, and MISSION CONTROLLER appears on the screen, against a

                    Hi, guys.  Glad to get your message.
                    We gather from the ten-year
                    communications lag that you are
                    approximately 18 parsecs away.  Drop
                    us a line more often, won't you?

                    Sorry to hear about all the
                    malfunctions, and real sorry to hear
                    about the death of Commander Powell.
                    There was a week of mourning all
                    over Earth.  The flags were at half
                    mast.

                    Now I hate to send bad news when you
                    guys are up there doing such a swell
                    job, but something's come up, and we
                    all felt you ought to know about it.
                    Our systems simulation computer has
                    predicted that by the time this
                    message reaches you -- that is to
                    say, in about ten years -- there
                    will be a failure in one of your
                    vital ship's systems.  The
                    malfunction will occur in --
                              (rifles papers)
                    -- system number E180246.  You can
                    see what a problem this would be if
                    you didn't catch it on time.  Now

     The room is dim and eerie, banks of dimly flickering lights and the
     hum of air-cooling machinery.

     Talby is seated before a glowing screen.  He punches several buttons,
     and the screen comes to life.  A schematic cross-section of the ship
     appears in glowing green lines.

     Talby punches more buttons, and the screen flashes through the levels
     or the ship.  Finally it shows Level 6.  There is a small red light
     pulsing in the <u>Emergency Air Lock</u>.

     Talby punches another button.  The Emergency Air Lock is magnified
     fifteen times until it fills the screen.  The red light is pulsing in a
     small area labelled COMMUNICATIONS LASER #17.

     Talby picks up a microphone.

                    Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir,
                    but I'm in the Computer Room, and I
                    think I've located the malfunction.
                    The scanner shows it to be some sort
                    of fault in the communications
                    laser, down by the Emergency Air

     Talby stops facing LASER SHAFT 17.

     The plate cover on the laser shaft hangs loose; it appears to be

     Very carefully, Talby reaches out to touch the dangling plate cover on
     the laser shaft.  He pushes it, and it drops to the floor of the lock
     with a CLANG.

                    Attention.  Attention.  The bomb has
                    malfunctioned.  Automatic dampers
                    have gone into effect, and will
                    confine the explosion to an area one
                    mile in diameter.  Please contact
                    mission control and await further
                    instructions.  Thank you for
                    observing all safety precautions.

     Pause.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Only one thing to do.  I'll have to
                    ask Commander Powell.  I'll have to
                    ask him what to do.

     <u>INTERIOR - FREEZER ROOM</u>

     Doolittle climbs down a ladder into the icy-blue, cold Freezer Room.
     The walls are covered with frost, and mist hangs in the air.

     He pulls on a pair of insulated gloves and approaches a heavy freezer
     door.  On the door is a sign:

                         CRYOGENIC FREEZER COMPARTMENT

                         CAUTION

                         ABSOLUTE ZERO

     He opens the door.

     COMMANDER POWELL is encased in the freezer in a post-death, frozen
     ammonia state.  Wire and electrodes are attached to his head.

     Doolittle takes a microphone from a console on the freezer.  He flips a
     switch and speaks into the mike:

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander Powell?  Commander Powell,
                    this is Doolittle.  Can you read me?

     A crackle of static comes from a speaker grille, along with the FAINT
     MUTTERING OF COMMANDER POWELL'S VOICE:

                                   POWELL
                    ... muffirup glurrinpinfropal...

     Doolittle fiddles with the volume control, trying to bring Commander
     Powell's voice into audibllity.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.
                    Ah, there's something serious come
                    up, sir, and I have to ask you
                    something.

                                   POWELL
                              (very weakly)
                    I'm glad you've come to talk with
                    me, Doolittle.  It's been so long
                    since anyone has come to talk with
                    me.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander, sir, we have a big
                    problem.  You see, the Veil Nebula
                    bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck.  It
                    won't drop from the bomb bay.  It
                    refuses to listen and plans to
                    detonate in --
                              (checks watch)
                    -- less than eleven minutes.

                                   POWELL
                    Doolittle, you must tell me one
                    thing.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What's that, sir?

                                   POWELL
                    Tell me, Doolittle, how are the
                    Dodgers doing?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up,
                    disbanded over thirteen years ago.

                                   POWELL
                    Ah... pity, pity...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You don't understand, sir, we can't
                    get the bomb to drop.

                                   POWELL
                    Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't
                    you have anything nice to tell me
                    when you activate me?  Oh, well, did
                    you try the azimuth clutch?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yes sir.  Negative effect.

                                   POWELL
                    What was that, Doolittle?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Negative effect.

                                   POWELL
                    It didn't work?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    That's correct, sir.

                                   POWELL
                    Sorry, Doolittle.  I've forgotten so
                    much since I've been in here.  So
                    much.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What should we do, sir?  The time is
                    running out.

                                   POWELL
                    Well, what you might try is --

     Commander Powell's voice is drowned in a burst of static.  Doolittle
     fiddles with the dials.

                                   DOOLITTLE

                    Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle...
                    Sorry, I've drawn a blank.  Hold it.
                    I'll have it again in a minute.  I
                    forget so many things in here, so
                    many things.  Hold on, just a minute,

                    But how do you know you exist?

                                   BOMB #20
                    It is intuitively obvious.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Intuition is no proof.  What concrete
                    evidence do you have of your own
                    existence?

                                   BOMB #20
                    Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I
                    am.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    That's good.  Very good.  Now then,

                    exists?

                                   BOMB #20
                    My sensory apparatus reveals it to
                    me.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Right!

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    All right now, here's the big
                    question: how do you know that the
                    evidence your sensory apparatus
                    reveals to you is correct?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What I'm getting at is this: the
                    only experience that is directly
                    available to you is your sensory
                    data.  And this data is merely a
                    stream of  electrical impulses which
                    stimulate your computing center.

                                   BOMB #20
                    In other words, all I really know
                    about the outside universe relayed
                    to me through my electrical
                    connections.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Exactly.

                                   BOMB #20
                    Why, that would mean... I really
                    don't know what the outside universe
                    is like at all, for certain.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    That's it.

                    Intriguing.  I wish I had more time
                    to discuss this matter.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Why don't you have more time?

                                   BOMB #20

                    Now, bomb, consider this next
                    question, very carefully.  What is
                    your one purpose in life?

                                   BOMB #20
                    To explode, of course.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    And you can only do it once, right?

                                   BOMB #20
                    That is correct.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    And you wouldn't want to explode on
                    the basis of false data, would you?

                                   BOMB #20
                    Of course not.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Well then, you've already admitted
                    that you have no real proof of the
                    existence of the outside universe.

                    Yes, well...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    So you have no absolute proof that
                    Sergeant Pinback ordered you to
                    detonate.

                                   BOMB #20
                    I recall distinctly the detonation
                    order.  My memory is good on matters
                    like these.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yes, of course you remember it, but
                    what you are remembering is merely a
                    series of electrical impulses which
                    you now realize have no necessary
                    connection with outside reality.

                                   BOMB #20
                    True, but since this is so, I have
                    no proof that you are really telling
                    me all this.

                                   POWELL
                              (weakly)
                    Men... men... what happened, men?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.

     The planet begins to rise behind Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    Looks like I'm headed for the
                    planet, Talby.  Going right toward
                    it.

                                   TALBY
                    When you fall, Doolittle, if there's
                    anyone down there on the planet,
                    somebody may see you.  They may see
                    you coming down.  What a beautiful
                    way to die... as a falling star...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Guess you're right.

     Talby turns his head and looks behind him.

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle, I'm heading right toward
                    something.  It's behind me, in the
                    distance.  Something that glows.

     Far behind Talby, coming nearer, is a shimmering point of light.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Oh yeah?

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix
                    Asteroids!

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Phoenix?

     The point of light is closer now, and it has begun to differentiate
     into a group of beautifully colored frost-like shapes.

                                   TALBY
                    It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix!
                    They glow with all the colors of the
                    rainbow, just like everybody said.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    No kidding?

                                   TALBY
                    I'm going into them, I'm going to
                    hit them.  Doolittle...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yeah?

                                   TALBY
                    Before we get too far away, and our
                    signals start to fade, I just wanted
                    to tell you... you were my favorite.
                    I really liked you, Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I really liked you too, Talby.  Hey,
                    some debris from the ship!  It's
                    coming right by me.

     Several chunks of debris from the ship drift past Doolittle.

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle, I'm catching up to the
                    asteroids.  I'm going to be a part of
                    them in a minute.  Doolittle, I'm
                    going into them.

     Talby drifts into the huge frost-like shapes, expanding and glowing
     and spinning, slowly refracting all the colors of the spectrum with a
     cold glow.

                                   TALBY
                              (cont'd)
                    I'm beginning to glow.

     The field of spectral shapes, with Talby in their midst, begin to
     drift away into the distance.

                                   TALBY
                              (cont'd)
                    They're taking me with them, with
                    the Phoenix... going to circle the
                    universe forever.  I'm with them
                    now... be back this way again some
                    day.  Doolittle, before it's too
                    late, there's one last thing I
                    want to tell you...

     Talby's signal dies out as the glowing lights disappear into the
     depths of space.

     Doolittle is hanging onto a long, thin chunk of debris.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Hey, Talby!  I've grabbed a piece of
                    the ship, and I think I've figured
                    out a way!

     He pulls the piece of metal down beneath his feet, and stands on it.

     Crouching and extending his arms, Doolittle surfs down into the
     atmosphere of the planet, banking and planing as he disappears to a
     small dot.

     END TITLES AND MUSIC OVER.

EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY

The plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley
under five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon
across the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through
the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of
guyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and
chimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the
clanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted
by the falling snow.

In the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which
inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly
down the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad
looking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by
the skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow
sidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched
between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the
hillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run
to three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of
toppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are
all connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility
lines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional
aid from a leaning pole.

MUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as
we watch a car come charging up through the slush on
Columbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the
slippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears,
huddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS
CAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY
STREET.

MAIN TITLE COMES UP:

			  THE DEER HUNTER

INT. STEEL MILL - DAY

A white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and
comes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, and
another and another and another. The ingots are huge,
trembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying
rumble.

CREDITS ROLL

UNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with
tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS
wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in
heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures
in some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is
hard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who
are young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are
NICK, SAL and MERLE.

CREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise
is deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on
with murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause
MERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL.
SAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK
make the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips,
gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE
and NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts
laughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track
again and they all grab their tongs.

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - ALTAR - DAY

A very old PRIEST is making preparations for a wedding
ceremony. SAL'S MOTHER hovers around him as he unlocks a
cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which
will be used in the service. The PRIEST moves with agonizing
slowness and SAL's MOTHER is in the midst of a bad case of
nerves.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	It's all ready? Everything's ready?

			PRIEST 
	Yes.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	Are you sure everything's ready?
	Are you positive?

			PRIEST 
	Everything. Yes.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	It would snow... Everything's going
	to slip. Everything's going to
	slide... All the cars are going to
	crash!

SAL'S MOTHER puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into
tears.

			SAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
	I can't believe this... My own
	little boy... with a stranger!

The PRIEST smiles. He takes SAL'S MOTHER in his arms and
comforts her.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

Another car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides
back. As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses
bursts open and a group of giggling BRIDESMAIDS begin
scampering across the street. They have all been working on
their dresses, which are not completely finished, and they
all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. As
they make their way to the other side of the street they all
wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. One
of the BRIDESMAIDS loses her dress entirely and with everyone
laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. When the
garment is repossessed a door comes open and the BRIDESMAIDS
disappear inside.

CAMERA HOLDS ON COLUMBINE STREET. The snow slants across the
little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little
houses. Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides
back. Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group
of OLDER WOMEN emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a
miniature bride and groom standing on the top. The WOMEN are
all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats.
They begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow,
with the great white cake held firmly between them.

INT. STEEL MILL - ENTRY AREA - DAY

The time clocks are lined against both walls. As a whistle
screams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin
checking out. NICK, SAL and MERLE are right up in the front
ranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather
together along the wall.

			NICK
	Where's Vince?

			SAL
	There's Albert! 
		(calls)
	Hey, Albert!!!

ALBERT -- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox --
changes course and plows across the river of homeward-bound
STEELWORKERS.

			ALBERT
	How you feelin', Sal?

			SAL
	I feel okay.

			ALBERT
	Feeling hot?

			NICK
		(arm around SAL)
	Humper's ready. Old humper's
	hotter'n damn hell!

			MERLE 
	There's Vince!

			OTHERS
		(calling)
	Vince!... Over here! Vince!

			MERLE 
	Get him, Albert. Get Vince!

			ALBERT 
	I'll get him.

ALBERT wades back into the stream of STEELWORKERS, grabs
VINCE and they all push out together.

EXT. STEEL MILL - PARKING LOT - DAY

The snow is still falling. It covers the ground. It covers
the acres of parked cars. It swirls and tosses and blows. As
the five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all
stop dead in their tracks.

			VINCE 
	Snow... Holy shit, snow!

SAL gives a look at the others. Something is going on. VINCE
is so excited he begins hopping around.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	 ... Do you know what this means?
	Do you guys realize exactly what
	this means?

They all know. They all know damn well. MERLE and NICK
exchange looks. ALBERT chortles.

			SAL 
	What are you guys...? Are you guys
	going hunting?

The others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet. They are all a
little embarrassed.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Not tonight?... You're not driving
	up tonight?

			NICK 
	As soon as you're hitched, Sal.
	First we get you hitched.

			SAL 
		(envious)
	You guys are crazy. You know that?
	I mean you guys are really nuts.

			VINCE 
	He's getting married... and we're
	nuts!

			NICK
		(puts his arm around SAL)
	It's all right. Hey, it's all
	right. We'll be right here, right
	with you.

A look at the others...

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Won't we? Right? Am I right?

			MERLE 
	Right.

			ALBERT 
	Damn right!

			VINCE 
	What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you
	think we'd miss this?

Now SAL is embarrassed. He makes a gesture with his hand.

			NICK 
		(with a laugh)
	C'mon. C'mon you guys!

They all start into the swirling snow. NICK with an arm
around SAL.

			VINCE 
	And we want you to know, Sal, that
	any help you might need--

			ALBERT 
	Yeah, Sal--

			MERLE 
	Willing fingers--

			ALBERT 
	Extra feet!

INT. V.F.W. POST - DAY

The place is large and drafty and rundown. A huge American
flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. Under it WOMEN are
laying white table cloths on trestle tables. Off to one side
a half dozen OLD MEN wearing VFW hats are Scotch-taping paper
ribbons to the brick wall. Two OLD MEN are on stepladders,
two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under
the direction of a pair of World War I VETS standing side by
side. Their hands tremble. Their four eyes loom huge behind
corrective lenses.

			VET 1 
	Up I would say... What would you
	say?

			VET 2 
	Up.

			VET 1 
		(signals)
	Up ribbon!

One end of the ribbon is moved up. The two VETS study it.

			VET 2 
	Down I would say... What would you
	say?

			VET 1 
	Down.

			VET 2 
		(signals)
	Down ribbon!

Suddenly there is a commotion. The WOMEN who are setting up
the tables all rush to the door as the OLDER WOMEN come in
with the wedding cake. The OLDER WOMEN look half-frozen and
as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus
of Uhh's and Ahh's. Suddenly one of the OLDER WOMEN
collapses. Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and
give her wine. The WOMAN takes the glass, tosses it off in
one swallow and grins. EVERYONE laughs.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - BOTTOM OF HILL - DAY

A big, battered old shark-finned black Cadillac approaches,
coming fast.

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE and ALBERT are all laughing. NICK is
at the wheel.

			VINCE
	Hit it, Nick!

			OTHERS
	Go Nick! Hit it, baby!!!

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

The car bangs over potholes and slams into the grade. We
watch as it reaches the half-way point, then the three
quarter mark...

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

NICK bends forward over the wheel, peering out through the
slapping wipers.

			GUYS IN THE CAR
		(chanting)
	Do it, Nick! Do it! Go Nick, Go! Do
	it! Do it, Nick! Go!

The car fishtails, loses speed... to a creep.

			NICK 
	Back! All hands to the rear!

ALBERT and MERLE, who are sitting in front, immediately throw
themselves into the back seat on top of SAL and VINCE.

			GUYS IN BACK SEAT 
	Easy... 'At's it, easy! Easy,
	Nick... Easy!

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY

The Cadillac inches up the last ten feet, gains level ground
and skids to a stop. From inside comes a MUTED CHEER.

INT. BRIDE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

ANGELA is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil. She is
plump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes.
ANGELA leans forward into a mirror.

			ANGELA
		(sincerely)
	I do.

A pause. ANGELA scowls and tries it again.

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
		(heartfelt)
	I do.

ANGELA tries it a few more times. It sounds worse and worse.

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
	I do, I do, I do!!!

ANGELA stares at herself. Now she looks desperate and
unrelievedly forlorn. Bursting into tears she throws herself
on the bed. Someone has slipped a photograph under the
pillow. The photograph is face down and as ANGELA pulls it
out she sees that something is written on the back:

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
		(reading, slow)
	"This is it -- more or less...
	Love, Mom."

ANGELA frowns, turns the photograph over. It is a picture of
Michaelangelo's "David". ANGELA stares at the figure for a
long, long moment...

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
	Oh, wow.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

The place is packed with boisterous STEELWORKERS drinking
boilermakers. Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the
bar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. The murals
depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once
comical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret
from the hunters, some power beyond their own.

JOHN bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. At
the same moment SAL comes in with NICK, MERLE, ALBERT and
VINCE. JOHN, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his
tray, wraps his arms around SAL and begins jumping him around
the floor, grinning ear to ear. The STEELWORKERS turn, desert
their places and swarm around SAL, joking and shouting
congratulations.

INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

LINDA is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly
lovely face. Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone
in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. Thumping noises are
coming from the room above. The thumping gets louder.
There is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were
being thrown around. A MAN'S VOICE begins cursing and there
is more thumping and crashing. Suddenly there is a thud...
and then silence.

LINDA bites her lip. She crosses to the stove, ladles stew
into a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it
all on a tray.

INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - FATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

The room is a wreck of broken furniture. Chairs are turned
over, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the
wall. In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is
LINDA'S FATHER. His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he
holds a half-empty bottle in his hand. Behind him, through
the open window, snow is blowing in.

LINDA comes in with the tray. She stands for a moment
expressionless, looking down at her father. Then she sets the
tray on the bureau and kneels beside him.

			LINDA 
	Daddy?

			FATHER
		(mumbles)
	Go... fucking hell!

LINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and
rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes
up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles
from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it
seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins
cursing again.

			FATHER (CONT'D)
	Fucking shit... all around, like a
	sea! Like an ocean!

LINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets
down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the
bed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by
the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The
effort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her
eyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father
groans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him
on the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in
the face and pushes her violently across the room.

LINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into
the wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her.

			FATHER (CONT'D)
	Fucking bitch... All bitches!

He swings, catches her in the face again, hard.

			LINDA
	Daddy...! Daddy, it's me!

			FATHER
	Hate 'em. Fucking bitches!

LINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and
falls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her
jaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face. 

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY

Seven MUSICIANS, carrying their instruments, file silently
through the falling snow.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND JOHN'S BAR - DAY

The WOMEN are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging
from grandmothers to young wives. About half of them wield
rolling pins or heavy pans. As the last reinforcements arrive
-- TWO HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS -- a roar of laughter
comes from inside.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are dancing. The
MUSIC is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut
with a knife. Suddenly, from the back, comes a CHORUS OF
SCREECHES AND FEMALE RECRIMINATIONS. The door to the alley
bursts open and the HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS appear. The
STEELWORKERS take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their
heads in their hands and rush for the front door.

EXT. JOHN'S BAR - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

The STEELWORKERS stream into the snow with the WOMEN close
behind. Several blows are delivered and the howls of
complaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get
dressed for Sal's wedding.

CAMERA CLOSES ON SAL, who emerges with NICK and MERLE. The
snow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop.

			SAL 
	Boy, this is it. This is really
	it... I mean... here I go.

SAL'S MOTHER hurries out of the alley. She is crying.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	My beautiful boy! My angel... who
	is leaving his own mother.

She throws herself in SAL's arms, sobbing.

			SAL 
	Momma...

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	So cold is your heart to leave your
	own mother?

			SAL 
	Momma, I'll be right upstairs.

SAL throws a look to NICK and MERLE. They gesture with
sympathy and study the snow flakes.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	So cruel is your heart? Is your
	heart so uncaring?

			SAL
		(a litany now)
	One flight, Momma. It's one flight.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

The trailer is a dented two-tone pink and cream job which
looks as if it had been purchased third-hand off a
construction site. It stands on cinder blocks in a small lot
which has been cut out of the side of the hill. A wrecked
school bus decorates it to the right. On the left is a bare
branched tree. NICK's black Cadillac is parked in front and a
light shows from inside the trailer.

CAMERA PICKS UP MERLE who is strolling toward the trailer
whistling through his teeth. He is wearing his tuxedo and
carries a knapsack and a deer rifle. He mounts the cinder
block steps and pounds on the trailer door. NICK opens the
door and waves him in.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

The place is cramped, littered with camping paraphernalia. A
deer head is mounted above the sink and NICK, who is half
into his tuxedo, is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy
boots. MERLE smiles, throws his kit on the stove and sits.

			MERLE
		(indicates the
		waterproofing)
	You should have put that on last
	night.

			NICK 
	I know.

			MERLE 
	That way it sets.

			NICK 
	Yeah.

Pause.

			MERLE 
	I just wait. You know?

			NICK 
	Huh?

			MERLE 
	I just wait. For this... It's what
	I wait for... I wait all year.

			NICK 
	So do I.

			MERLE 
		(sharp)
	You do?

			NICK 
		(nods)
	Yeah.

NICK grins, takes down his rifle and begins wiping the oil
off it.

			MERLE 
	You think about it?

			NICK
	Yeah.

			MERLE
	So do I.
		(watches Nick for a
		minute)
	I want to be ready... You have to
	be ready... It has to be there, in
	your mind.

			NICK
	The shot?

			MERLE
	Fucking A.

			NICK
	I don't think about the shot that
	much.

			MERLE
		(firmly)
	You have to think about the shot.
	It's the shot. The shot's it.

			NICK
		(uncertain)
	Yeah... I guess.

			MERLE 
		(studies him)
	What do you think about?

			NICK 
	I don't know... I guess I think
	about the deer... Being out, maybe.
	I don't know. I think about it all.
	Hell, I like the trees, you know? I
	like the ways the trees are, all
	the different ways the trees are
	too.

			MERLE
		(with a glance to the
		window)
	I'll tell you something, Nick. I
	wouldn't hunt with anyone but you.
	I won't hunt with a yo-yo.

			NICK 
		(laughs)
	Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?

			MERLE 
	Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you
	think's a yo-yo! They're all yo
	yo's. I mean they're all great
	guys, for Christ's sake, but... The
	point is, Nick, without you I'd
	hunt alone. Seriously. I would.
	That's what I'd do.

			NICK
		(laughs)
	You're a fucking nut. You know
	that, Merle? You're a fucking
	maniac!

			MERLE 
	Yeah.
		(he grins)
	When it comes to hunting, that's
	true.

Cursing and banging from outside. NICK opens the door. JOHN
and ALBERT, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are
pounding on the trunk of the Cadillac, trying to get it open.
NICK and MERLE go out. 

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

			NICK 
	Albert! For Christ's sake... John!
	Wait a minute, you guys!

			ALBERT
	It won't open.

			NICK 
	You gotta hit it here. Here,
	Albert, not there.

			ALBERT 
	Where should I hit it? Just show me
	where I should hit it.

			NICK
	Here. Hit it here.

ALBERT hits the trunk in the indicated spot and the lid snaps
open.

			ALBERT 
	Hey, that's neat.

NICK nods.

			ALBERT (CONT'D)
	That's new, isn't it?

			NICK 
	Couple of weeks... Listen --

			ALBERT 
	I love this car. Some cars sit, you
	know? This car, a car like this...
	grows. I mean you never know, with
	a car like this, where this car has
	been.

VINCE comes up, also in tuxedo, and dragging a totally
disorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him.

			VINCE 
	Hey, guys...

			JOHN
	Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup
	de Ville.

ALBERT looks around at his friends. He surveys the back end
of the Cadillac with simian pride. Then he expands his chest,
thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent,
mile-carrying Tarzan call. As the echo of it comes back the
church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of
excited BRIDESMAIDS come, hurrying up.

			BRIDESMAID 1
	Albert, what are you doing!

			BRIDESMAID 2
	Hurry up, you guys!

			BRIDESMAID 3
	Who's got their carnations?

			BRIDESMAID 4
	Here. They're right here.

			BRIDESMAID 1 
	Look at you! You're all a mess!

			BRIDESMAID 3
	Put on their carnations!

			BRIDESMAID 1 
	Who's got a pin?

As the BRIDESMAIDS begin straightening ties and putting on
carnations, NICK hears someone call his name. He turns to
find LINDA standing beside the trailer where she can't be
seen. She looks pale and very frightened and she holds a
small suitcase in her hand.

			NICK
		(crosses)
	Linda...

			LINDA 
	Hi.
		(forces a smile)
	Nick, your shoes are soaking.

			NICK 
	Linda, what's the matter?

			LINDA
		(tries to toss it off)
	Oh... You know...

She fights against it but the tears begin to come. NICK looks
around, pulls her inside the trailer.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

NICK clears a place on the couch. LINDA sits, holding her
suitcase in her lap.

			LINDA
		(with great effort)
	I was just wondering... Nick...
	You're going hunting... If I could
	use this place to stay, because...

			NICK 
	Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.

			LINDA 
	I'd want to pay you... and I was
	thinking --

			NICK 
		(kneels in front of her)
	Linda... Hey, Linda...

			LINDA
	I would want to pay you, Nick...
	and I was thinking --

			NICK
	Linda, Linda...!

			LINDA
		(very small, looking into
		his eyes)
	What?

			NICK
	Will you marry me?

			LINDA
		(after a long, long
		moment)
	Okay.

			NICK
	Would you?

LINDA nods - a solemn nod.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	You would?

LINDA's lip begins to tremble. Tears stand in her eyes and
she gives a little toss of her head.

			LINDA
	Who else, dummy?

NICK stares at her. He can still hardly believe it.

			NICK
	This is terrific...! This is really
	terrific!

LINDA nods. She is suddenly excited, suddenly radiantly
happy. She takes the suitcase off her lap and throws herself
in NICK's arms.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	I don't know what we've been
	waiting for!

			LINDA
		(eyes closed, loving him)
	I don't know! I don't know either!

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - NIGHT

SAL and ANGELA stand facing each other as the PRIEST reads
the Holy Sacrament of Marriage.

			PRIEST 
	"Blessed be the Kingdom... now and
	forever unto Ages and Ages...

As the PRIEST continues with the Holy Sacrament CAMERA PICKS
UP FACES IN THE CONGREGATION. We see SAL'S FAMILY. We see
ANGELA'S FAMILY. We see the VETS from the V.F.W. Post. We see
the STEELWORKERS from the bar and the WIVES and MOTHERS who
chased them home to change. They are hard faces -- working
class faces -- but we sense a fortitude among the
congregation, a community of both heart and spirit.

CAMERA PICKS UP NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN standing
in a row opposite the BRIDESMAIDS. The guys all look slightly
disheveled. Their tuxedos are all too small and their shoes
are soaking wet from walking in the snow.

NICK catches LINDA's eye and they hold each other across the
intervening space like two children who are amazed.

The PRIEST hands white tapers to the bride and groom. CAMERA
CLOSES SLOWLY ON THE PRIEST. The man is impressive -- gentle
yet full of power. The PRIEST lights the tapers -- first
ANGELA's, then SAL's -- and looks out across the assembled
congregation.

			PRIEST 
	"For everyone that does evil hates
	the light, and does not come to the
	light, lest his deeds will be
	reproved."

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF THE HILL - NIGHT

Save for a lone figure trudging home, the street is deserted,
left to the gently falling snow. In the background the
massive silhouette of the steel mill is plainly visible, lit
with fire.

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - NIGHT

NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN join with the BRIDESMAIDS
to assist the PRIEST in the crowning of SAL and ANGELA.

The PRIEST crowns SAL first.

			PRIEST 
	"The servant of God, Sal, is
	crowned for the servant of God
	Angela, in the Name of the Father
	and of the Son and of the Holy
	Ghost. Amen."

Now ANGELA is crowned.

			PRIEST (CONT'D)
	"The servant of God, Angela, is
	crowned for the servant of God,
	Sal, in the Name of the Father and
	of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
	Amen."

Guiding the couple by their joined hands the PRIEST leads SAL
and ANGELA around the analoy. The movement is very precise,
very formal, a circling to represent eternity.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

The Band is going full blast and the whirling COUPLES, young
and old, are laughing.
We see SAL and ANGELA, NICK and LINDA, VINCE, ALBERT and
JOHN. The only one of the group not dancing is MERLE. MERLE
is drinking, standing alone on the side of the floor chugging
beer in tense, rapid-fire gulps. We sense immediately that he
feels out of place, at a loss to join spontaneously in the
spirit of the party. MERLE finishes the beer, crumples the
can and starts on another. As he picks up the second can he
notices that a SAD-LOOKING GIRL is sitting against the wall
behind him, waiting for someone to ask her to dance. The SAD
LOOKING GIRL gives MERLE a smile. MERLE pretends not to see
and moves behind a post.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT

The wedding cake that was carried in earlier has now been
attacked from all sides, but the miniature bride and groom
are still standing in the middle. Unnoticed by each other
SAL'S MOTHER and ANGELA'S MOTHER eye the little figures. Both
women are in rather teary condition and begin moving toward
the cake. Suddenly, as the CROWD shifts, they encounter each
other face to face. Smiles are exchanged -- strained smiles,
which get stretched and stretched and stretched. Then, in
unison, they desert the smiling and remove their respective
offspring from the cake. SAL'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar
coated groom and ANGELA'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar
coated bride. Then they eye each other, burst into tears and
throw themselves in each other's arms, moaning and sobbing.

INT. V.F.W. POST - COAT ROOM - NIGHT

Another COUPLE tries to enter the rack. It is pretty full.
They finally find an empty place and squeeze in.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

NICK comes off the floor with LINDA and throws an arm around
MERLE.

			NICK 
	Sit with Linda, man, will ya?...
	Give her a beer.
		(to Linda with great
		solicitude)
	Would you like a beer?

			LINDA
		(puzzled)
	Sure.

			NICK 
	What kind of beer would you like?

			LINDA 
		(laughing)
	I don't know.

			NICK
		(to Merle)
	Give her Miller's. Miller's High
	Life.

NICK takes off. LINDA sits down at a table and MERLE goes to
the cooler to get a Miller's. He gropes around in the tub,
finds one and pops the tab. Suddenly he notices that NICK has
crossed to the SAD-LOOKING GIRL by the wall. He has stopped
in front of her and is asking her something. The SAD-LOOKING
GIRL gives a blush, gets out of her chair and NICK takes her
in his arms and begins to dance. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL looks
transformed. She begins chattering and laughing.

MERLE crosses back to LINDA and gives her the beer. As he
pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and
nearly loses his balance. He is very drunk.

			MERLE 
	Sorry.

			LINDA
		(laughs)
	It's okay, Merle.

NICK swings by with the SAD-LOOKING GIRL and waves.

			MERLE 
		(catching Linda's
		expression)
	I guess you like Nick.

			LINDA 
		(nods)
	Yes.

MERLE doesn't say anything for a moment. He seems to be
trying to contain a floodtide of emotion.

			MERLE
	Fuckin' Nick... 
		(clears his throat)
	Fuckin' Nick... gives. 
		(he nods, bangs his fist
		on the table)
	Gives. Fuckin' Nick gives.

INT. V.F.W. POST - COATROOM - NIGHT

The rack is still jammed with COUPLES but the laughing and
giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing
and low moans.
What light there is comes from the colored glass ball
revolving above the dance floor, where the MUSIC is now
playing sweet and low.

The front door comes open and a U.S. Army SERGEANT steps into
the darkened hallway. The man wears his dress green uniform.
On his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are
brightly polished.

			SERGEANT
	Pow!

The SERGEANT gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance
floor.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLE AREA - NIGHT

The SERGEANT passes between groups of celebrating GUESTS,
plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at
the end of one of the white trestle tables.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

ALBERT gives his Tarzan cry, suddenly picks his GIRL off her
feet and marches around holding her above his head.

			GIRL 
	Albert, what are you doing...
	Albert!

INT. V.F.W. POST DANCE FLOOR - ANOTHER LOCATION - NIGHT

VINCE and JOHN are standing together. VINCE is going bananas
because his girl, MARSHA, is dancing too close to FRED.

			VINCE 
	Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a
	minute, watch. There! D'j'u see
	that? D'j'u see the way he... You
	know what that guy is doing? That
	guy is squeezing her ass!

			JOHN 
	Oh, well...

			VINCE 
	Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?!
	The guy is actually... He did it
	again! That's what he's doing...
	He... He's reaching in, John, to
	her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna
	kill him right now.

VINCE marches up and taps FRED on the shoulder. FRED releases
MARSHA. MARSHA waits, one hand on her hip, while the two of
them exchange words. VINCE turns MARSHA, points to her ass.
FRED turns MARSHA, pints to the small of her back. VINCE is
hopping up and down now. So is FRED. MARSHA, who is getting
bored, points to the door. VINCE and FRED bang out. As soon
as they have gone MARSHA is taken by someone else who puts
his hand right back where FRED had it.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT

NICK, SAL and MERLE are standing together, looking at the
SERGEANT.

			MERLE 
	Nick, he just came back.

			NICK 
	From Nam?

			MERLE 
	Fucking A. See that ribbon in the
	left. That's Quan Son. That fucking
	guy was at Quan Son!

MERLE gestures with his head. NICK and SAL cross with him to
the SERGEANT.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	We, ah... We're going too.

The SERGEANT looks at them and delivers a big, blank smile.

			SERGEANT 
	Pow!

			MERLE 
	What?

The SERGEANT keeps smiling.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(to Nick)
	What'd he say?

			NICK 
	Pow.

			MERLE 
	Pow?

			NICK 
	Pow.

			MERLE 
	Oh.

MERLE nods.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(clears his throat)
	Uh... well, maybe you could tell us
	how it is over there?

			SERGEANT 
	Pow!

			MERLE 
	Pow?

			SERGEANT 
	Pow!

MERLE looks at NICK. NICK looks at SAL. They all begin
scratching their heads, trying not to laugh.

			MERLE
	Well, thanks a lot.

They turn away and then, when they are out of earshot, they
all break up, howling.

			SAL
	Who the hell is he?

			MERLE
	Who the hell knows!

			NICK
	Is he from here?

			MERLE
	Hell no!

			NICK 
	Well, where's he from?

			MERLE AND SAL
		(in unison)
	Who the hell knows!

			MERLE
		(soberly)
	Maybe he's lost.

			SAL AND NICK
	Lost???

			MERLE
		(throws up his hands)
	Well, I don't know!

INT. V.F.W. POST - NIGHT

The GUESTS have formed in a long double line which extends
from the dance floor right out into the street. Everyone is
pretty drunk and they are all armed with streamers and bags
of rice. As SAL and ANGELA appear from out of a back room
there is a great rowdy CHEER. The MUSICIANS strike up a
MARCH. Followed by the MUSICIANS, showered with streamers,
rice, advice and encouragement, SAL and ANGELA walk the
gauntlet toward the street, where a glossy, bright red
Pontiac with headers and straight pipes is being revved in a
series of ear-splitting crescendos.

EXT. V.F.W. POST - STREET - NIGHT

JOHN, ALBERT, MERLE and VINCENT are standing by the door.
Their tuxedos are stained and torn. Their carnations are
squashed and their clip-on bow ties are either missing
entirely or dangling from the open collars of their shirts.
VINCE looks the worst, with a black eye and half his pant leg
torn away, and they are all guzzling beer.

			VINCE 
	Bullshit! That's bullshit!

			MERLE 
	You wanna bet?

			VINCE 
	I'll betcha! That's bullshit and
	I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!

			MERLE 
	How much? How much do you wanna
	bet?

			OTHERS
	Bet him! Bet him, Vince!

			VINCE 
	I'll betcha! I'll betcha... I'll
	betcha twenty dollars!

EXT. V.F.W. POST - PARKED PONTIAC - NIGHT

SAL and ANGELA emerge to more CHEERS and a shower of
streamers and rice. ANGELA is helped into the Pontiac on the
right. NICK throws an arm around SAL and walks him around to
the driver's seat.

			NICK 
	Don't worry what it says in the
	book.

			SAL 
	Right.

			NICK 
	Just forget that. Forget what it
	says in the book.

			SAL 
	I'm gonna start slow... At the top.
	Then I'm gonna work down.

			NICK 
	Great. That's great.

			SAL 
	That's my plan.

NICK gives SAL a hug. SAL gets in the car.

			NICK
	See you Monday.

			SAL
	See you Monday.

INT. PONTIAC - NIGHT

SAL looks over at ANGELA.

			SAL
	All set, hon?

ANGELA nods. SAL puts the car into gear and starts slowly
off. Fists pound on the car. Rice and streamers shower down.
Suddenly, through the front windshield, MERLE appears, stark
naked, running in front of the car with colored paper
streamers floating out from his upraised right hand. For a
split second SAL cannot believe what he is seeing. He throws
a look at ANGELA. ANGELA covers her mouth in amazement and
then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

MERLE weaves down the street in front of the growling red
Pontiac. MERLE is not just running. He is leaping and
bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a
realm of pure ethereal space.

NICK, ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN pound down the street behind the
Pontiac, ALBERT carrying MERLE's clothes.

			GUYS
	Look at that! Fuckin' guy! Fuckin'
	Merle!... Unbelievable!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The road forks, one road going high to a parking area, the
other descending to the valley below. MERLE swerves up the
incline toward the parking area, while the Pontiac goes
straight and disappears down the hill.

ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN stagger to a stop, panting helplessly.
NICK grabs MERLE's clothes from ALBERT and takes off up the
hill.

EXT. HILLSIDE PARKING AREA - NIGHT

MERLE stands motionless, looking out across the valley as
NICK approaches. The night is brilliantly clear and the fires
from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow.

NICK comes to a stop a few feet away.

			NICK 
	Merle?

MERLE turns. His face has a strange, distant look, and he
gives NICK an almost feral grin.

			MERLE 
	You think we'll ever come back?

			NICK
		(startled)
	From Nam?

			MERLE 
	Yeah.

NICK moves up beside him. He doesn't know what to say.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	I love this fuckin' place... That
	sounds crazy. I know that sounds
	crazy, but I love this fuckin'
	place... If anything happens, Nick,
	don't leave me there. I mean it.
	Don't leave me... You gotta
	promise, Nick. You gotta promise me
	that.

			NICK
		(half laughing)
	Merle --

			MERLE 
	Promise! You gotta promise!

			NICK 
	You got it.

MERLE lets out his breath. It is as if some great weight had
been pressing on him.

			MERLE
		(with a laugh)
	Let's go huntin'. I mean let's do
	it!

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THRUWAY - NIGHT

NICK'S battered old shark-finned Cadillac comes screaming
past.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN, all of them still in
tuxedos, are jammed in the car between knapsacks, sleeping
bags, six packs of beer and deer rifles.

			GUYS
		(singing)
	Let me be free! Let me be free!
	If... you... will let me be free...
	You'll... always be happy... with
	me-e-e-e!!!

			ALBERT
		(making a trumpet sound)
	Wa-wa-wa!... Waaaaa!!!

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

Tale Cadillac comes blasting by...

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

NICK is hunched over the wheel, his eyes gone completely
glassy. MERLE and VINCE are on the nod, while ALBERT and
JOHN, both half asleep, are having a lead-voiced
conversation.

			ALBERT
	She fucked you?

			JOHN
	She fucked me.

			ALBERT
	She fucked me too.

			JOHN
	She fucked you?

			ALBERT
	She fucked me too.

There is a long pause. They both struggle to keep their eyes
open.

			JOHN
	She fucked us both.

			ALBERT 
	Yeah.

			JOHN 
	Fucking women, man...

			ALBERT
		(shakes his head)
	I know...

INT. CADILLAC NIGHT

NICK'S head is sunk below the upper rim of the steering
wheel. One eye is entirely shut and the open one seems close
to death. Suddenly his head snaps up. He slams his foot down
on the brake and the Cadillac fishtails, rubber screaming, to
a jolting stop.

EVERYONE in the car comes awake ten bleary eyes staring out
through the windshield.

There are deer in the road, fifteen or twenty of them
standing in the headlights.

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

VINCE, ALBERT, NICK and JOHN pile out with their rifles.
VINCE immediately slips and falls down.

			VINCE 
	Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!

			JOHN 
	Who's got the ammo?

			ALBERT 
	Ammo! Get the ammo!

			VINCE 
	I'll get it! Where is it?

			JOHN 
	It's in the trunk!... It's in the
	trunk! I'm telling you, it's in the
	trunk!

VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush around to the trunk. ALBERT
begins pounding on it.

			VINCE 
	There, Albert! Hit it there!

Pushing and shoving each other, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush
around to the side of the car. As they pass along the
embankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound,
like a sigh, and all three of them simultaneously vanish.

NICK, who has been watching, stares at the place where his
three friends disappeared. He takes a few steps forward,
realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle of
the road, helpless with laughter.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(getting out of the car)
	Man, let's go hunting!... Where are
	they?

NICK makes a gesture, a downward pointing of his finger.
VINCE crosses to the side of the road.

EXT. RAVINE - NIGHT

The slope is a good 45 plus. At the bottom, barely visible,
three tiny figures flop in the snow.

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

VINCE looks down at the three hunters with an expression of
absolute disgust. He looks at NICK -- flat on his back,
pounding his feet, howling -- and then he looks at the deer.
The deer are still watching. If anything they have edged
closer and their massed expression of polite curiosity throws
VINCE into a blind rage.

			VINCE 
	Get out of here, damn you! Go
	home!... Scat!... Shoo!

VINCE, whose rifle is fully loaded, slams a shell into the
chamber and lets off a barrage of shots above the deer.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Bastards! Assholes! Get lost!

EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAWN

The sky is cold -- first light -- with low, wind-driven
clouds. CAMERA TILTS DOWN and we see NICK's Cadillac coming
up a narrow road flanked by precipitous, heavily forested
ridges on both sides.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN

The Cadillac seems minuscule, overwhelmed by the massive,
black slopes looming up from the road.

INT. CADILLAC - DAWN

Everyone is eating cold hot dogs, ripping them out of a half
dozen plastic packages, dipping them in a jar of mustard and
stuffing them down. Hot dog juice has dripped over
everything, potato chips are littered everywhere and both
beer and milk are being passed around.

			ALBERT
	Fuel up. Need fuel.

			JOHN
	Those are mine!

			ALBERT
	You want 'em?

			JOHN
	Damn right!

			ALBERT
	Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.

			MERLE
	Here's a Hershey.

ALBERT tears off the wrapper, dips it in the mustard and
glomps it down.

			JOHN
	That's mustard!

			ALBERT
		(mouth jammed full)
	What?

			JOHN
	You just put mustard on your
	Hershey bar.

			ALBERT
		(nods)
	Good... Pass the beer.

			VINCE
		(pointing to a location
		beside the road)
	Here, here! This is it!

			MERLE
		(milk slopping over him)
	Watch it, shithead!

			VINCE
		(pounds Nick on the
		shoulder)
	Here! This is it!

			ALBERT 
	It is not!

			VINCE 
	It is too! Now you passed it!

			MERLE
	It's ahead, by the tree.

			NICK
	It's ahead, Vince.

			VINCE 
	That isn't it! There's no way
	that's it... Unless they changed
	it. They might have changed it.

NICK pulls to a stop on the shoulder.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	They changed it. That's what they
	did. This is it but they changed
	it.

EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN

The sky is just turning grey. A cold wind is blowing, moaning
in the trees and swirling a fine haze of snow across the open
roadway. The guys all pile out in their wrecked tuxedos.

			VINCE
	This is it. Definitely. This is it,
	but they changed it.

			ALBERT 
	You're full of shit.

			VINCE 
	Who's full of shit?

			ALBERT 
	You're full of shit!

			VINCE 
	I'm telling you, they changed it!

			ALBERT 
	They did not!

			VINCE 
	They did too!

			ALBERT 
	Jesus, it's freezing!

NICK, MERLE and JOHN have the trunk open and are taking stuff
out. MERLE strips down where he stands and begins putting on
his hunting clothes. ALBERT and VINCE grab their things and
follow the example of NICK and JOHN, who are changing on the
corner of the seats.

			NICK 
	Whee-uu!

			ALBERT 
	Jesus!

			JOHN 
	Holy shit!

			VINCE 
	Merle, hey Merle, you got any
	socks?

MERLE, who is crouched down studying the hillside, looks
over.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(rummaging around in the
		mess of things he has
		brought)
	Never mind, Merle. Never mind, I
	got 'em... Where the hell are my
	pants? Anyone see my pants?... Who
	the hell took my pants!

VINCE begins plunging around.

			OTHERS 
	Fuckhead! Watch it!

			VINCE 
	Somebody took my pants... I know I
	brought pants.

VINCE tears into another pile of equipment, comes up with
nothing and steps out of the car.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	All right. All right, you guys.
	Whoever took my pants, I want 'em
	back!

EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN - LATER

Shots are ringing out in the hills. NICK, ALBERT and JOHN
stand by the roadside while VINCE and MERLE glare at each
other. VINCE is still in his tuxedo pants, is still wearing
his dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose down
vest that could only have come from ALBERT. MERLE's knapsack
lies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it
contains a pair of Vibram-soled mountain boots.

			MERLE 
	Sure I got boots. I got boots right
	here.

			VINCE 
	Then lemme have 'em.

			MERLE 
	No.

			VINCE 
		(both hands in the air)
	No!!!?

			MERLE 
	No.

			VINCE 
	What do you mean, no???

			MERLE
	That's it. No. No way.

			VINCE 
	Some fuckin' friend... You're some
	fuckin' friend, Merle!

			MERLE 
	You gotta learn, Vince! You come
	out here... You got no jacket, you
	got no pants, you got no knife and
	you got no boots. You think
	everyone's gonna take care of you!
	That's what you always think, but
	this time you're wrong. This time
	you're on your own!

			ALBERT
	Merle, give him the boots.

			MERLE
	No. No boots. No nothin'.

			VINCE 
	You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle.
	You know that? You're one fucking
	bastard!

			MERLE 
		(snapping it out, jabbing
		his finger at the ground)
	This is this, Vince. This isn't
	something else. This is this!

			VINCE 
	You know what I think? There's
	times I think you're a goddamn
	faggot!... I fixed you up a million
	times, Merle!
		(to the others)
	I fixed him up a million times! I
	don't know how many times I fixed
	him up... and nothin' ever
	happens... Zilch! Zero!... The
	trouble with you, Merle, no one
	knows what you're talking about!
	"This is this"? What does that
	mean, "this is this"? I mean is
	that some faggot bullshit, or is
	that some faggot bullshit!!! And if
	it isn't, what the hell is it???

			JOHN
	Vince. Hey, you guys --

			VINCE
		(hopping now)
	Take last night...! Last night he
	coulda had twenty fuckin' deer!
	More! He coulda had more! And look
	what he does! I mean look what he
	fuckin' does!!!

			JOHN 
	Vince!!!

JOHN throws up his hands in a comical way.

			JOHN (CONT'D)
	I'll get the boots.

			ALBERT
		(in agreement)
	Get the boots.

			JOHN
		(crossing to Merle's
		knapsack)
	I mean let's get going before --

MERLE -- who has remained completely calm throughout VINCE's
tirade -- pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle. JOHN
freezes in his tracks and stares at him, his face gone white.

			MERLE
	I said no.

JOHN looks at ALBERT, who is right behind him, and they both
back away. VINCE, who is standing directly opposite MERLE,
begins to tremble. His mouth comes open, closes and comes
open again. Urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his
pants leg, staining the snow. Suddenly, NICK steps forward.
He looks at MERLE, crosses to the knapsack, takes out the
boots, walks over to VINCE and throws them on the road.

			NICK
		(gently, to Merle)
	Let's hunt.

INT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

The place is about nine-by-twelve. The floor is rotted out,
boards are missing from the walls and the entire structure is
canted to the right. Hanging from the roof peak is a hissing
Coleman lantern which sways in the wind.

VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are sacked out, sound asleep. Beer
cans -- some old, some new -- litter the floor. Wet clothes,
most of them bloody, hang from tie-boards and nails. Strung
up on the end wall are two deer carcasses, one of them with a
knife jammed in it where steaks have been cut out.
Snow is blowing in -- dry, crystal bright. It swirls over
everything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor.

CAMERA DISCOVERS MERLE AND NICK. They are both in sleeping
bags, lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the broken
door. The wind gusts and moans. The cabin shudders and then
there is a sudden lull.

			MERLE 
	Hey, Nick?

			NICK 
	Huh?

			MERLE
	Tomorrow I go with Vince.

			NICK
	Hunt with Vince?

			MERLE
	Yeah... I mean so he knows... He
	doesn't even know.

EXT. THRUWAY PITTSBURGH OFF-RAMP - TWILIGHT

Traffic is heavy, an unending flow of cars, a river of
headlights suspended on a curved concrete trestle which seems
to float in thin air. Behind is the mill, belching steam and
ablaze with fire.

NICK's Cadillac appears, horn blaring, weaving through the
traffic. The car sits low. Trussed to the hood, to the roof,
to the trunk, are the carcasses of five deer. Rope-ends
flutter and bang in the wind. The car shudders and thuds.
Inside, grinning maniacally, NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and
JOHN are all shouting and guzzling beer.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TWILIGHT

The Caddy appears, swerving onto Columbine with tires
screaming and NICK still leaning on the horn. The guys are
all hanging out the windows, shouting to FRIENDS, whistling
at GIRLS and banging a triumphant tatoo on the doors.

			ALBERT
	Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!

			JOHN
	Hey Geraldine, let's eat!

			VINCE
	Nothin' to it, asshole! Piece o'
	fuckin' cake!

As the car ascends the grade the mill appears behind it,
seeming to loom upward under the pink-streaked twilight sky.

CAMERA HOLDS AS THE CAR COMES TOWARD IT. The headlights blaze
white, like huge hungry stars, and the eyes of the dead deer
on the fenders glitter gold and green and red.

ALBERT leans out the window and gives his Tarzan call... IT
SEEMS TO ECHO, AS IF COMING FROM FAR AWAY,

							FREEZE FRAME...

EXT. CLOSE-UP OF JUNGLE LEAF - DAY

The leaf is being eaten by an exotic-looking insect. After
each bite, the insect lifts its head, produces an exceedingly
thoughtful expression, and chews.

WE HEAR THE BUZZ AND CREAK OF OTHER INSECTS, THEN A DULL,
FLUTTERING DRONE. THE DRONE GROWS LOUDER...

EXT. HELICOPTER SQUADRON - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY

There are twenty of them, coming fast and low, just over the
tops of the trees. Sunlight gleams on their paint and
murderous-looking rockets are packed to their bellies in fat
clusters, like eggs.

Suddenly, in unison, they fire the rockets.

EXT. RANGE OF LOW HILLS - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY

As the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot
upward, lost to sight. There is an eerie silence and then the
hillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two
miles wide.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

A platoon of AMERICANS have been ambushed on the road. The
bodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts
spilled in the dirt. No one moves and there is absolute
silence except for the low buzz of flies.

A V.C. LIEUTENANT steps into sight. He gives a brusque
command and V.C. SOLDIERS step out of the jungle. The
LIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS --
idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he
rubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERS
laugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke.

There is a slight sound. The V.C. LIEUTENANT spins and gives
a low command. Fifty feet away there are three grass huts.
He signals his SOLDIERS to spread out and then he starts
toward them.

INT. GRASS HUT - DAY

South Vietnamese VILLAGERS -- women, children, and a few old
men -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness. The WOMEN hold their
hands over their BABIES' mouths. Flies buzz and there is a
look of stark terror in their faces.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

One of the fallen AMERICANS moves. CAMERA CLOSES ON THE
SOLDIER. His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a
gash in his temple. The face is unshaven, frighteningly
gaunt, but we recognize that it is MERLE.

A WOMAN'S SCREAM comes from the direction of the huts. A shot
rings out. MERLE pulls himself to his hands and knees and
stands there, on all fours, like a dog.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY

The V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing them
in the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emerges
from a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by their
feet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her a
kick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. The
BABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABY
comes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on the
end of his bayonet.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

MERLE strips a B.A.R. from one of his dead companions, slams
a fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and starts
for the grass huts. His movements are slow, almost dreamlike,
and his face is expressionless, like someone risen from the
dead.

EXT. GRASS HUTS DAY

The VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in
a line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks up
and down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY lies
in the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries to
play with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the air
squats nearby and yawns.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

MERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick look
around the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neat
package and draws back.

CAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreaming
things, glittering blankly.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY

MERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic. The V.C.
SOLDIERS go down screaming, arms and necks thrown back, in a
thin mist of spraying blood.

ABOVE THE CHATTER OF MERLE'S B.A.R. WE HEAR A GROWING ROAR.

EXT. APPROACHING AMERICAN HELICOPTERS - DAY

There are five of them, coming in low under the tops of
nearby trees.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - THE VILLAGERS - DAY

The VILLAGERS stand motionless, staring at the helicopters
and frozen with terror. They turn. They start to run. And
then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm.

EXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAY

MERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds of
billowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush of
heated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothes
are burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a
blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet.

In front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in two
charred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both are
motionless now, like two roasted stones.

An AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of the
burning huts. MERLE and the LIEUTENANT spin on each other and
then the LIEUTENANT lowers his carbine.

			LIEUTENANT
	What the hell are you doing here?

			MERLE 
		(numb)
	Saving lives.

MORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the
trees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL.

			LIEUTENANT
	Move it out, girls! Move it out!

The LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE.

			NICK
	Merle?... Jesus, Merle!

MERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. He
seems to be looking right through him.

SAL comes up behind NICK.

			SAL
	Hey...! Hey, Merle!

A shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly the
whole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire.
Grenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive for
cover.

Out of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and more
of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

We are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug
and fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by
stones. The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits
are filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo
gratings. In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men --
SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their hands grip the gratings
and their eyes are hollow. Other than an occasional groan
there is only the sound of the falling rain.

A V.C. SOLDIER trudges out of the jungle. As he reaches the
pits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and
down on the bamboo gratings. The hands disappear. As soon as
one comes back, the SOLDIER stomps on it, shrieking with
laughter. Then, almost as an afterthought, the SOLDIER pulls
down his pants and squats above the center grating.

CAMERA TILTS SLOWLY UPWARD. We see the clearing in its
totality. It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and
contains only two structures. One is a large bamboo "tiger
cage" with a few leaves tied to its top. The other is a small
hut with a thatched roof. The walls of the hut are open and
we can see V.C. GUARDS moving about inside.

A cry comes from the hut. There is the THUD of a rifle butt
on flesh and the cry abruptly stops.

INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY

In the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with a
rose-patterned plastic top. At opposite ends of the table are
two chairs. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONER sits in one of the
chairs. In the other chair, facing him, is MERLE.
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE has a welt on his head and one of the
half-dozen V.C. GUARDS in the hut is screaming at him. In the
middle of the table, between the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and MERLE,
is a single-action .45 caliber revolver with an American
eagle carved on its ivory grip.

MERLE sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, taking
in every detail of the scene. The V.C. GUARD gives the SOUTH
VIETNAMESE a final cuff, takes up the revolver with a
dramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber.
Immediately the OTHER GUARDS begin placing bets. The GUARDS
are a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser,
and it takes some time to straighten things out.

MERLE looks off to his right:

INT. THATCHED HUT - REVERSE ANGLE - DAY

We see more SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN prisoners standing
against the wall. Most of them have been badly beaten and all
have their elbows tied behind their backs. In among them,
standing beside one another, are NICK and SAL. NICK looks
grey, like a skinny ghost. SAL is out of control, sobbing
quietly.

INT. THATCHED HUT - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAY

The betting is now completed. The V.C. in charge waves the
.45 around and calls for silence. Then, closing the cylinder
containing the single bullet, he points the revolver at the
ceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the
revolver goes off with a ROAR. Bits of thatch flutter down
from the ceiling. The V.C. GUARDS shout enthusiastically and
grin.

MERLE sits motionless. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE across the table
from him begins shaking uncontrollably.

The V.C. in charge now reloads the revolver with one
cartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the table
between MERLE and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and gives it a good
spin.

The revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at
MERLE. MERLE stares at it for a long beat. Then he picks it
up, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and
pulls the trigger. The hammer falls on an empty chamber with
a loud CLICK.

MERLE places the revolver back on the table and pushes it
toward the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE begins to
tremble again. Fumbling horribly he finally manages to get
the gun in his hand. He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer
and puts the gun to his temple. The gun weaves around.
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE closes his eyes and pulls the trigger.
There is a loud CLICK.

MERLE takes the revolver again. He spins it, cocks it -- all
in one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls the
trigger. There is another CLICK.

MERLE pushes the gun back across the table. This time the
SOUTH VIETNAMESE takes it up with sudden confidence. He spins
the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls on
the trigger.

THERE IS A ROAR. THE PISTOL IS FLYING IN THE AIR AND THEN THE
MAN'S HEAD, HALF-EXPLODED, CRASHES OVER ONTO THE KITCHEN
TABLE.

MERLE doesn't even blink. The GUARDS begin hooting and
laughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, and
MERLE watches them, watches every gesture, every movement...
like a cat.

EXT. THATCHED HUT - LATER DAY

A pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain. The
bodies are both SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their heads
are all variously blown to pieces and SEVERAL HUGE RATS are
already feeding on them.

INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY

NICK is at the table now, opposite a SOUTH VIETNAMESE. He
holds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. His face is
twitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are
holding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for
a long time.

NICK raises the pistol to his temple, CLICKS OUT. The GUARDS
murmur. NICK pushes the pistol across the table.

INT. THATCHED HUT - PRISONER END - DAY

There are no Americans left to play except SAL. The sobbing
has stopped but SAL is shaking and trembling and his eyes
wander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose.
MERLE, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to
SAL. As he does so we hear the CLICKS coming from across the
room and the excited MURMURS of the GUARDS as their betting
choice survives another round.

			MERLE 
	You can do it, Sal.

			SAL 
	No. No, no.

			MERLE 
	Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have
	to do it.

			SAL
	I want to go home, Merle.

			MERLE 
	You have to think about this, Sal.
	Listen to me, Sal! You have to
	think about this.

			SAL 
		(tears again)
	This is horrible!

			MERLE 
	Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do
	it they'll put you in the pit. If
	they put you in the pit, Sal,
	you're gonna die... Sal, do you
	understand?

			SAL 
		(nods)
	Merle, I wanna go home!

There is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S
eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS
open a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and
the GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor.

			MERLE 
	Listen to me, Sal. Do it! You have
	to do it!

The GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags
him of f to the table.

INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY

SAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placed
opposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even younger
than SAL, and he is trembling with terror.

			SAL 
	Hey, listen, you can do it. 
		(Sal nods, smiles)
	Believe me, you can do it. We can
	both do it. Then we go home, see?
	Then we go home!

SAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle
comes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH
VIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his
eyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then
SAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH
VIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around,
cocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the
SOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS
TAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVES
HIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD.

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS AN
EXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR.

SAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed
in an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face begins
to move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to
discover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again at
the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry.

INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAY

A half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in the
muck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back,
DEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the
roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the
floor.

On the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in a
fetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back
and forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an
expression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at
the table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sits
slumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he is
picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn
at the knee.

MERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE AND
LOOKING OUT AT THE "PITS".

EXT. THE PITS - MERLE'S POV - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

The pits are about twenty feet away. Running mud and water
gurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the
downhill side. There are fewer hands than the day before, far
fewer. The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watches
he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip.

SUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY. THE HAND COMES BACK FOR
A MOMENT, THEN BOTH HANDS DISAPPEAR.

INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE turns away from the "pits". He looks down at SAL, then
he looks at NICK. His expression is one of exasperation, as
if he had been having a long argument.

			MERLE 
	I'm telling you, Nick, no one's
	going to come.

			NICK 
	What are you, God?

			MERLE
	Listen, asshole, it's up to us!

			NICK 
	They bombed last night, right?
	Didn't they bomb? If they bombed
	last night, they could bomb
	tonight. They could be up there
	right now!

			MERLE 
	What are you, hoping?

			NICK 
	What else?

			MERLE 
	I thought you might be praying.

			NICK 
	I'm doing that too.

			MERLE 
	I suppose you wish you were
	somewhere else?

			NICK 
	What do you think?

			MERLE 
	Nick, you're wasting your time...
	Listen to me! You're wasting your
	time! This is no fucking time for
	hoping or praying or wishing or any
	other shit! This is it. Here we
	are... And we gotta get out!

			NICK 
	You're right... Okay, you're right.

			MERLE 
		(grabs him)
	Get off your ass, Nick. Get off
	your fucking ass and stand up!!!

			NICK
		(stands)
	Okay, okay!
		(he straightens his
		shoulders)
	Okay. Okay, you're right... What
	about Sal?

			MERLE 
	Forget Sal.

			NICK 
	What do you mean?

			MERLE 
	I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take
	it, Nick.

			NICK 
	Forget Sal?

			MERLE 
	Forget Sal... Listen to me --
	forget Sal! I've been working on
	Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a
	dream and he won't come out.
	LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go
	for you. You hear me? For you!

			NICK 
	Merle...

			MERLE 
	LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR
	HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD
	TOO!

A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE
whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn.

Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDS
coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all
drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the
pearl-handled revolver.

NICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(calm)
	We gotta play with more bullets.

			NICK 
	We what?

			MERLE 
	We gotta play with more bullets,
	Nick. It's the only way.

			NICK 
	More bullets in the gun?

			MERLE 
		(even)
	More bullets in the gun... The
	trouble is that still leaves one of
	us with his hands tied up, so that
	means we gotta play each other.

			NICK 
		(numb)
	With more bullets?... Against each
	other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you
	fucking nuts!!!

			MERLE 
	Nick... NICK!!! It's the only
	chance we've got!

NICK stares at MERLE. Rain is pouring off them in rivulets
and the VOICES of the approaching GUARDS are getting louder.

			NICK 
	How many bullets?

			MERLE
		(watching him)
	Three bullets -- minimum.

			NICK 
		(panic)
	No way. No fucking way!

			MERLE 
		(evenly, holding him with
		his eyes)
	I'll pick the moment, Nick. The
	game goes on until I move. When I
	start shooting, go for the nearest
	guard and get his gun.

			NICK 
	No. No way!

			MERLE
	When you get the AK, open up. You
	got me? Open up.

			NICK
		(screaming)
	YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW
	YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY
	CRAZY!!!

The GUARDS begin screaming orders from outside the cage and
ONE OF THEM lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which
shreds the bamboo roof just above the PRISONERS' heads. NICK
and MERLE grab SAL and drag him to the door.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

As the PRISONERS emerge from the "tiger cage" the GUARDS
smash them with their rifle butts, screaming orders. In the
melee SAL is separated from NICK and MERLE, both of whom are
knocked to the ground by furious blows. When they get to
their feet they see that SAL is wandering off alone in the
direction of the "pits". One of the GUARDS spots SAL and
clubs him down.

SAL gets up and begins wandering off again. The GUARD clubs
him down again, turns to the GUARD IN CHARGE and begins
complaining. The GUARD IN CHARGE dispatches a SECOND GUARD to
help the FIRST and the TWO GUARDS open the bamboo grating on
one of the "pits".

MERLE turns to NICK, who is standing beside him.

			MERLE 
	It's up to you, Nick. Now it's up
	to you.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - THE "PITS" - DAY

SAL has absolutely no comprehension of what is about to
happen to him. His eyes are dreamy, far away, as if he had
mentally transported himself to some distant place. There are
great gashes in his head from the blows he has received and
as he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly
like a very small child who has experienced some terrible
confusion.

Suddenly the GUARD standing beside SAL wrenches him around.

We see the pit now, CLOSE UP. There are four bloated CORPSES
floating in the muck.

We SAL'S FACE, CLOSE UP. He gives a CRY and tries to turn
away.

We see the GUARDS pick SAL up, SCREAMING. We see the SPLASH
as SAL hits the water and then we see him surface between the
bloated CORPSES, STILL SCREAMING, paddling desperately and
trying to find something solid to hod him up.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - WAITING PRISONERS - DAY

NICK stands motionless, stunned, listening to SAL'S SCREAMS.
MERLE has his attention focused on the GUARD IN CHARGE and
when he glances in their direction MERLE slugs NICK in the
stomach and begins beating him furiously to the ground. NICK
struggles to his feet. MERLE attacks him again and now, as
the GUARD IN CHARGE comes over to see what's going on, MERLE
begins hopping up and down, pointing at NICK, pointing at the
revolver in the GUARD'S hand and screaming.

			MERLE
	Him and me!!! Him and me!!!

The GUARDS look at each other, interested.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Him and me, goddamn it! Him and me!

INT. THATCHED HUT - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE and NICK sit facing one another across the rose
patterned kitchen table. The GUARDS are all grinning and even
the SOUTH VIETNAMESE are watching with grim fascination. NICK
has the revolver. He is trembling visibly. Already MERLE has
managed to draw the GUARDS in closer and as NICK spins the
cylinder and cocks the hammer MERLE jumps up and begins
pounding on the table.

			MERLE 
	This is it, motherfuckers! Now he's
	going to do it! Watch! You watch!

NICK almost loses what little control is left and his hand
begins shaking violently.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Look at him! See! This is it and he
	knows it!

Side bets begin changing hands.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Last chance to lose your money
	there, guys. Goodbye money! Hurry,
	hurry. Here he goes!

NICK puts the revolver against his temple and pulls the
trigger. There is a dull CLICK.

NICK puts the revolver back on the table. His hand is shaking
so badly it falls with a clunk. MERLE grabs it, spins it,
sticks it to his temple and CLICKS OUT, talking all the time:

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	This is stupid! You understand
	stupid? On and on! At this rate
	we'll still be here tomorrow!
		(throws the revolver on
		the table)
	Wait a minute. I know! Hey, I got
	it. More! Put in more! You
	understand more? More! More
	bullets!
		(he mimes with his
		fingers)
	Three bullets! You understand
	three? That way BLAM! BOOM!

MERLE hops up and down, laughing maniacally.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	KA-POWIE!!! BA-ROOM!!!... 'Cause I
	want that bastard! Him I want boom!
	Him or me!!!

The GUARD IN CHARGE looks at his COMPANIONS. They all begin
shouting for him to go ahead. The GUARD IN CHARGE purses his
lips, as if imitating a general coming to a decision, and
then nods his assent. The GUARDS all howl. MERLE joins right
in.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	He's terrific! Great fucking guy!

The GUARD IN CHARGE takes the revolver, opens the cylinder
and begins sticking in two more cartridges.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	KA-POW!!! BA-ROOMIE!!!

MERLE hops up and down again, then screams at NICK, jabbing
his finger at him, as if in fury.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Both of us may have to pull on
	this, so get your shit in fuckin'
	shape!!!
		(to the GUARDS)
	Him or me!!! Now we got it, him or
	me!!!
		(he rubs his hands and
		sits back down)
	Place your bets, motherfuckers! Now
	we're going! Now we got a game!

The GUARD IN CHARGE places the revolver on the table, spins
it.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Watch! Now watch! He's going to get
	it. And then KA-POW! BA-ROOMIE!!!

The muzzle stops pointing at MERLE. MERLE scowls, looks over
at the GUARD IN CHARGE. The GUARD IN CHARGE has lifted the
barrel of his AK 47 and is watching him with caution. The
OTHER GUARDS, who are totally caught up in the game, are
yelling and shouting.

			MERLE 
	You guys think I'm in trouble,
	right?

MERLE picks up the revolver, spins the cylinder, cocks it...

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	No way! Never!!!
		(he begins to chant)
	MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!
	MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!
	MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA!
	MERLE LIVES LONG!
	Lemme hear it. Come on,
	motherfuckers, lemme hear it!

MERLE starts it again. The GUARDS who are bett ing on him
JOIN IN:

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(with GUARDS)
	MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!
	MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!
	MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA!
	MERLE LIVES LONG!

MERLE takes a glance at the GUARD IN CHARGE again. The GUARD
IN CHARGE is still eyeing him with caution.

MERLE places the revolver to his temple... and CLICKS into an
empty chamber.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	See! Nothing to it.

He pushes the gun across to NICK. Then he stabs his finger at
him, screaming again, as if in a fit of rage.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	You got an empty chamber and it's
	in your mind! Just put that empty
	chamber in the gun!

NICK looks down at the revolver and picks it up. He stares at
MERLE for a moment. Then he spins the cylinder, cocks the
hammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an empty
chamber.

The GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting on
NICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE.

MERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated,
his brow furrowed in a mighty frown.

NICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face is
twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if
throwing back a challenge.

MERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an
expression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes the
revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no
longer possessed the strength to pick it up.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(gloom)
	Who's for Merle?
		(he thumps his fist on the
		table)
	Is anyone for Merle???

MERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as if
suddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, he
pushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table,
still in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body
sag over it.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Who here is for Merle...?

There is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the
rain. It is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. The
GUARDS stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated by
MERLE'S performance that they suddenly resemble little
children.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Who... here... is for Merle...?

MERLE begins his chant again. His voice is low, very
dramatic, and the GUARD IN CHARGE joins right in.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(with GUARDS)
	MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!
	MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!
	MERLE IS MAGIC -- HA!

MERLE snaps the revolver level in his hand and BLASTS the
GUARD IN CHARGE, hitting him full in the face. At the same
time NICK throws himself into the GUARD who is standing
behind him, spins and slams the GUARD'S AK 47 into his chin.
TWO MORE SHOTS BLAST OUT FROM MERLE'S .45 and we see TWO
GUARDS crash over the kitchen table. NICK now opens up with
AK 47, and as MERLE backs off beside him, also with an AK 47,
they GUN the remaining GUARDS to the floor.

It is over in an instant. The BODIES lie in a bloody, tangled
mess under a pathetic paper lantern. The rain drones on --
uninterrupted, undiminished, eternal...

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

Barely visible against the dripping foliage -- like a shadow 
is a startled V.C. SOLDIER. The man takes a half-step
forward, unslings his rifle and OPENS FIRE.

INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONERS are hit where they stand. NICK
spins, BADLY WOUNDED. MERLE throws himself on the floor and
lets go with the AK 47.

EXT. BAMBOO GROVE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE appears carrying NICK on his back. NICK is unconscious
and the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this far
can be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals.
As MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the
side of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling along
behind and attached to MERLE by a short rope.

MERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on the
ground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath,
SAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo
with an expression of pure terror.

			SAL 
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we
	going home?

There is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible.
MERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his
mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK.

For a moment there is nothing -- silence. The rain drones on
and we can hear NICK'S breath, which comes in short, shallow
rasps.

The sound comes again and suddenly a PLATOON OF V.C. SOLDIERS
appear, coming down through the trees. Their passage is
almost completely silent and they go by on both sides, moving
down the hill.

CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON MERLE'S FACE. His gums are bleeding
and his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in
his skull. His teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he
looks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - NIGHT

A huge battle is taking place nearby. The earth trembles and
shakes and gigantic explosions intermittently light the sky.

MERLE staggers down a ravine with NICK, loses his footing and
slides to the bottom where he lies in the mud, motionless,
too tired to move.

SAL comes down behind. He is hunched over, like a gnome. The
rope which MERLE has tied around his neck drags in the mud
and his eyes are huge with terror.

			SAL 
	Merle?

			MERLE
		(a whisper)
	Right here.

SAL crouches down in the mud.

			SAL 
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we
	going home?

			MERLE 
		(barely moving his lips)
	Right here.

Another explosion lights the sky, this one much closer. In
the flash we see that a red American car is stranded in the
middle of the road. There is another explosion and another
flash. The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise it
appears miraculously unharmed.

NICK'S breath rattles in his throat. MERLE, who lies beside
NICK, holding him, has closed his eyes. SAL, who is the only
one who has seen the car, stares at it hard, and for a long
time, trying it out with one eye and then the other.

			SAL 
	Merle?

No answer.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Merle?

Still no answer. SAL goes over to MERLE and shakes him.
Getting no response he crosses fearfully toward the
automobile. When he gets to within a foot of it, he reaches
out and touches it.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Merle. Merle, a car!

As the flashes continue to light up the sky, SAL peers at the
tires and begins kicking them.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Hey! Hey, gee!

SAL crosses to the window and looks in. There is no damage
whatsoever, the keys are dangling from the ignition. SAL
pulls open the door and climbs in. He pumps the accelerator,
hits the starter...

THERE IS A FLASH OF FIRE, THEN A HUGE EXPLOSION AND THE CAR
GOES UP IN A FIREBALL OF FLAME.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - BURNING CAR - NIGHT

MERLE has dragged SAL from the car and thrown him in the
ditch below NICK. SAL is horribly burned and MERLE kneels
over him -- out of breath, tears streaming from his cavernous
eyes -- howling with helpless rage.

			MERLE
	Damn it!!! God damn it!!!

MERLE looks down at SAL. SAL'S face in a mass of raw flesh
but his eyes look up at MERLE with lunatic, unwavering trust.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Sal!
		(more gently)
	Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you
	know anything?

			SAL
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we
	going home?

			MERLE
		(nods)
	Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - FOLLOWING DAY

REFUGEES are streaming down the road in a desperate,
frightened human torrent. There is every imaginable means of
conveyance -- from bullock carts to motorbikes -- but the
vast majority, carrying their meager belongings, are fleeing
on foot. The burned-out car is still in the middle of the
road and the great human tide streams around it, as if it
were an island. In the distance comes the sound of machine
gun fire and mortars are coming in nearby. MEDVAC helicopters
clatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the
skids. Now and then an ARMY CONVOY comes through, blasting
the REFUGEES into the ditch.

MERLE sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road.
NICK and SAL are gone and the area is littered with fresh
bandage packages and throw-away medical supplies. Suddenly a
jeep pulls up with a two-star GENERAL in it.

			GENERAL
	Where's your unit, soldier?

MERLE stares at the GENERAL -- blankly, without
comprehension. Finally, after a long moment, he gives a
slight shrug.

			GENERAL 
		(to his DRIVER)
	C'mon. We'll take him along.

The GENERAL and the DRIVER get out and start up the
embankment toward MERLE.

			GENERAL (CONT'D)
	Little R and R and you'll be
	standing tall again, son... Damn,
	this is steep!

			DRIVER 
	Uh-oh. Sir.

The GENERAL looks up at MERLE. MERLE is holding the pearl
handled revolver and he cocks the hammer with an audible
click.

			GENERAL 
	Uh-oh.

The GENERAL and the DRIVER turn tail, scramble back down the
embankment and pile in the jeep.

			GENERAL (CONT'D)
		(as they take off)
	Y'know, there's more fucking
	maniacs coming out of this
	conflict...

MERLE watches them go without expression. On the road below
the REFUGEES stream past -- by the hundreds, by the
thousands, by the tens of thousands. For a long moment MERLE
watches, then he jams the gun in his pants and stands.

EXT. EVACUATION ROUTE - DAY

MERLE is walking with the fleeing REFUGEES. CAMERA PANS,
HOLDING ON MERLE as he grows smaller and smaller -- to a
speck in the vast human torrent.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - SAIGON - DAY

The room is tiny, a cubicle furnished with a chair. NICK is
alone, standing at the window looking out. He wears ill
fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the
pallor of his skin. Around his neck is a piece of plastic on
which is stapled a colored paper marker. Departing aircraft
thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby
hydraulic mechanism.

EXT. LOADING RAMP (NICK'S POV) - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY

Black BODY BAGS are laid out in countless rows on the hot
concrete TWO PFC's are stacking them on pallets and MORE
PFC's, driving hydraulic LIFTERS, are loading the pallets
into the cavernous hold of a huge JET TRANSPORT.

INT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY

NICK turns away from the window and sits down in the chair.
Suddenly the door bursts open and a harassed DOCTOR comes in.

			DOCTOR
	Is your name Solomon?

NICK shakes his head.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	Are you sure?

NICK nods.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	Lemme see this.

The DOCTOR looks at the paper marker on NICK's neck.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	Is this yours?

NICK nods.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	This isn't yours. This can't be
	yours! I'm going to take this one
	off and cut it up...
		(he extracts a pair of
		scissors and does so)
	Shred it... so no one gets a hold
	of it. What I'm going to do now,
	I'm going to give you this one.
		(he staples a new marker
		around NICK's neck)
	There. How's that? Does that feel
	better?

NICK nods. The DOCTOR directs a finger at him.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	That one's yours.

The DOCTOR slams back out the door. Another jet thunders
overhead. The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriek
and whine...

NICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers
down at it from the corner of his eye. It seems to remind him
of something and he takes out his wallet. In his wallet is a
PHOTOGRAPH of LINDA. NICK peers at the photograph intently,
then closes his wallet and puts it away.

INT. U.S. ARMY TELEPHONE CENTER - SAIGON - DAY

Banks of telephones line the wall. Stretching out from the
telephones are long, ragged lines of SERVICEMEN waiting to
call home. The room is huge, full of echoes. Re-enlistment
posters are plastered everywhere and CANNED LATIN MUSIC is
playing.

NICK stands in one of the lines with only one person in front
of him. He looks anxious. He takes out his wallet again,
peers intently at LINDA'S PHOTOGRAPH, then puts it back.
NICK takes a half-step forward -- staring at the telephone --
and then he stops, frozen with fear.

			GUM CHEWER BEHIND 
	Go on, babe. Take it. 'S all yours!

			NICK
		(mumbles)
	You go ahead.

CAMERA HOLDS ON NICK as he turns out of the line and heads
for the exit under a long row of CLOCKS.

EXT. BUSY STREET - SAIGON - DAY

NICK comes along the sidewalk in a CROWD OF PEDESTRIANS. He
is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting
along for hours. As he comes to a stop, staring at a SOUTH
VIETNAMESE who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket
for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the
gutter. Suddenly, across the street, something catches his
eye.

			NICK 
		(calling)
	Sal...! Sal!!!

NICK throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even
looking.

Vehicles swerve and screech to a stop. NICK dodges between
them, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand
on the back of a passing SOLDIER. The SOLDIER turns. It is
not SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Sorry... Thought you were someone
	else.

The SOLDIER continues on his way. The CROWD streams on, a sea
of bobbing, brilliant color. NICK gropes in his pocket and
produces another pint bottle. He unscrews the cap and downs a
long swallow.

INT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT

The place is very dark. LOUD MUSIC is playing. Partially-clad
BAR GIRLS are dancing with the CUSTOMERS, while above, on a
kind of trapeze, NAKED GIRLS are performing obscene
contortions.

NICK sits at one of the tables. By now he is very drunk and a
BAR GIRL is giving him her undivided attention.

			NICK 
	I love Linda, see. I love Linda
	more than I can even say.

			BAR GIRL 
	Everybody love Linda.

			NICK 
	That's right. That's exactly what I
	mean!

			BAR GIRL 
	I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda
	so much!

			NICK 
	Only,good people love Linda, see.
	What Linda has, Linda --

			BAR GIRL 
		(in his ear)
	How you like to have nice fuck with
	Linda? You like that? Special,
	crazy fuck just like with Linda?

			NICK 
		(stares at her)
	You mean...?

			BAR GIRL 
	I show you. Come. You come. 
		(pulls him to his feet)
	Linda have special, crazy fuck.
	That right?

NICK nods. He looks as if he might be about to cry.

			BAR GIRL (CONT'D)
	I give you special, crazy fuck,
	just like Linda. Come. You come.
	Linda cry, make crazy moan?

NICK nods.

			BAR GIRL (CONT'D)
	I give you cry, crazy moan. Come.
	You come.

INT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT

The BAR GIRL comes around the corner with NICK, guiding him
to a flight of narrow stairs. She has one hand around his
waist and the other down the front of his pants.

			BAR GIRL
	You like to call me Linda now?

			NICK 
	Linda, yeah.

			BAR GIRL 
	You call me Linda, just like home.

Suddenly NICK draws to a stop, staring at a small window at
the end of the corridor. He tears himself loose from the BAR
GIRL and pushes up against the glass.

EXT. NARROW STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

Seated on the sidewalk against the wall of the opposite
building is an OLD MAN surrounded by a collection of white
ceramic elephants. A truck roars by in front of him.
Motorcycles sputter past and PEDESTRIANS hurry in both
directions. The OLD MAN sits motionless, like the guardian of
some timeless, silent kingdom.

INT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT

NICK spins away from the window.

			NICK 
	Hey... Hey, elephants! Look at
	those elephants!

The BAR GIRL stares at him.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Linda loves elephants! Linda... she
	loves 'em!

NICK turns and charges back down the corridor with the BAR
GIRL hot on his tail.

			BAR GIRL 
	Wait! First I give you special
	fuck!

			NICK 
	Elephants! Make way... I gotta get
	elephants!

EXT. NARROW STREET - NIGHT

NICK paces up and down in front of the OLD MAN and his
ceramic elephants.

			NICK 
	Great... These are great. I wanna
	tell you these are great elephants!
	I'm going home, see... Stateside in
	a few days and my wife Linda, she
	loves elephants. She... she has a
	thing for elephants because
	elephants... Elephants go on. You
	know what I mean? They go right on.
	I don't know if they cry. Maybe at
	night. I mean... What I mean is my
	two best buddies are dead, see,
	MIA, who knows, and they would have
	liked some elephants also
	because... How much are these
	elephants? I mean let's talk
	elephant.
		(notices a GROUP OF STREET
		URCHINS)
	Hey you guys...! Over here! Come
	over here and carry elephants!

The STREET URCHINS come running. They are ragged,
malnourished, ranging in age from about six to nine. They are
covered with sores. One of them ~as lost an eye and another
has lost a hand.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Everyone take an elephant!
		(to the YOUNGEST URCHIN)
	You know how to carry an elephant?
		(the URCHIN nods)
	That's what I thought. Right off I
	figured you as that kind of guy.
	Hey, wait a minute, I gotta get
	change. Take an elephant! Everyone
	take an elephant and then form up.
	Right here. Over here, like this,
	in a nice long elephant line...
	Good. That's good. Man, look at all
	these elephants! One, two, three,
	four, five, six, seven, eight,
	nine, ten... eleven elephants!
		(surveys them)
	Hey, but you gotta stand tall to
	carry elephants.
		(he illustrates)
	Better. That's better. I mean...
	God damn, I mean that's elephants
	now! Wait. Now you wait while I get
	change.

NICK dives into a nearby bar.

INT. NEARBY BAR - NIGHT

The place is as dark as the one before. MUSIC BLASTS from a
jukebox and two vaseline-covered GIRLS are dancing. As NICK
crosses to the bar to get change there is a WHISTLING SCREAM
and then the FRONT WALL OF THE BUILDING DISINTEGRATES IN A
ROAR OF NOISE.

NICK pulls himself out of the debris. There is absolute
silence in the WRECKED BAR but rockets are coming in all over
the city and the EXPLOSIONS rumble and roar.

EXT. NARROW STREET AFTER ROCKET EXPLOSION - NIGHT

A nearby building is burning fiercely. The street is deserted
except for the sprawled CORPSES of the STREET URCHINS which
lie this way and that, like broken dolls.

NICK walks out past the CORPSES. The street is littered with
fragments of broken ceramic -- gleaming, pure white, like
chunks of snow.

EXT. DESERTED STREET - SAIGON - NIGHT

The sky is alight with fires. Now and then HUGE EXPLOSIONS
rock the night and SIRENS wail.

A lone figure appears, walking down the middle of the street.
As the figure approaches we see that it is NICK.

			NICK
		(toneless, over and over)
	Hey, hey, the wind does blow. 
	Hey, hey, the snow does snow. 
	Hey, hey, the rain does rain...

NICK swallows, as if to force back some overwhelming emotion.
Then, squatting down under a lamp post, he begins again.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Hey, hey, the wind does blow.
	Hey, hey, the snow does snow...

NICK takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to the
PHOTOGRAPH OF LINDA and peers at it with a kind of ferocious
determination, as if this link were the last, as if by
staring at it hard he could make it hold.

			NICK (CONT'D)
		(his voice thin, cracking)
	Hey, hey, the wind does blow.
	Hey, hey, the snow does snow --

There is the sharp report of a pistol SHOT and then, as NICK
spins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the
unmistakable sound of APPLAUSE.

NICK stares at the building for a long moment, then he
crosses toward it.

EXT. YARD BEHIND BUILDING - SAIGON - NIGHT

A tiny light glows inside a paper lantern. Lying on the
around are three CORPSES, all of them Asian, all of them
expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown
off. As NICK stands looking at them a door comes open on the
back of the building,and TWO BURLY MEN bring out another
corpse. The body is that of a young American. Like the Asians
he is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the
right temple.

			MAN (V.O.)
	If you are brave and lucky I can
	make you rich.

NICK turns. A MAN is standing in the shadows of a small grape
arbor, eyeing him with a look of cold amusement. The MAN'S
accent is French. Beside him, on a small white table, is a
bottle of champagne and several glasses.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	You have played?

NICK stares at the MAN, nods.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	Once you have played it is not so
	hard. Cigarette?

NICK shakes his head.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	You seem... disturbed.

			NICK
	I... No. You do this for money?

			MAN 
	Mais certainment... A great deal of
	money. Naturally I do not do it
	myself. I myself do not possess the
	nerve.
		(smiles)
	But I am always... how do you
	say... looking out for those who
	do... It is a thing quite rare.
	Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't
	say no. When a man says no to
	champagne, he says no to life and
	that no man must ever do.
		(gives NICK a glass)
	Where did you play?

			NICK 
	Up north.

			MAN 
	Ah yes. Of course... So few
	survive.
		(smiles)
	La creme de la creme... How did you
	obtain release?

			NICK 
	Playing.

			MAN
		(raises his eyebrows)
	Playing?

			NICK
	We... Three bullets.

			MAN 
	And then you...

The MAN makes a clicking sound, three times, as if firing a
pistol. NICK nods.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	How extremely clever. That is
	really most extraordinaire... Allow
	me please to introduce myself. I am
	Armand... And you are?

			NICK 
	Nick.

			ARMAND 
	Nick. C'est extraordinaire! Do you
	know that I have a cousin who is
	called Nicholas and a nephew
	Nickolai. So you are, comme on dit,
	en famille. In the family.

There is another SHOT from inside and another round of
APPLAUSE.

			NICK 
	I have to go.

			ARMAND 
	But you must come in.

			NICK 
	No, I --

			ARMAND 
	But I insist.

			NICK 
	I have to go.

			ARMAND 
	You are frightened, no?

NICK nods.

			ARMAND (CONT'D)
	Of what is there to be afraid? The
	war? The war is no problem. It is a
	joke, a silly thing. I make one
	call and get you out.

ARMAND refills NICK's glass. NICK looks at it. The glass is
as thin as paper and the sparkling bubbles dance and hiss.
NICK lifts the glass and empties in one swallow.

			NICK 
	See, I'm going home.

			ARMAND 
	Ah yes. Of course.
		(smiles)
	To the girl who waits.

			NICK 
		(gives him a look and
		sits)
	Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?

			ARMAND 
	But of course! Please make yourself
	comfortable. Perhaps you would
	enjoy some fresh caviar, or une
	petite glace, or --?

			NICK 
		(weary, shaking his head)
	No. None of that.

			ARMAND 
	Unfortunately I must now go in, but
	I leave you my card. Naturellement
	I pay my players cash American.
	Just so you know.

ARMAND disappears in the darkness. Then his VOICE comes
again.

			ARMAND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
	However, should you prefer German
	marks, or perhaps Swiss francs,
	this of course can be arranged.
	Everything can be arranged.

ARMAND moves around the side of the building and the sound of
his FOOTSTEPS fades away. The TWO BURLY MEN come lurching
with another CORPSE. Laughter comes from inside the building
and there is a glimpse of AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED WOMAN seated
at a cafe table. The BURLY MEN return to the door and shut it
tight. In the distance the sky goes up in a huge flash of
fire and then the sound of the EXPLOSION rolls across the
city like a great dead wind.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - WINTER - DUSK

The trailer is all decked out with bunting and stuck, like a
plum cake, with tiny American flags. Stretching from the
trailer to the side of a house across the street is a huge,
hand-lettered banner which says "WELCOME HOME NICK!" and it
whips and it snaps in the cold winter wind.

NICK's battered old shark-finned Cadillac is in the yard.
Alongside it are a bunch of newer cars and PEOPLE are coming
from all directions, spilling in and out of the trailer and
congregating in excited, foot-stomping, half-frozen groups.

EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS - COLUMBINE AREA - DUSK

We see the OLD PRIEST on his way from the church. We see the
OLDER WOMEN, wrapped in shawls and carrying cakes and
cookies, trudging up the hill. We see ALBERT, JOHN and a
bunch of STEELWORKERS, all of them half-bombed, dragging two
cases of beer on a child's sled. We see LINDA peering out the
trailer window, pale and anxious-looking. We see VINCE, who
is unofficial lookout, jumping up and down at the approach of
every car and screaming, "This is it! This is Nick!" and
then, when it isn't, saying, "Not yet! Just hold your water,
I'll tell you when!"

And we see an empty street into which SIX VETS from the VFW
Post come tottering. The VETS are all in their old uniforms.
While three of them attempt to make MUSIC on a BASS DRUM, a
FIFE and an old Army BUGLE, the other three attempt to sing.

			VETS 
	Three cheers for the red, white and
	blue...!

			VET #1 
	This is hard.

			VET # 2 
	Christ Almighty, it's fifty years!

			VETS 
	Three cheers for the red, white and
	blue...

INT. TAXICAB - DUSK

NICK sits hunched forward in the back seat surrounded by
unwrapped cartons containing electric appliances he has
bought for LINDA. NICK looks nervous, VERY NERVOUS.

Suddenly, as the cab comes over the crest of a hill, the
trailer looms into sight, straight ahead, with VINCE hopping
up and down in the snow and the OLD VETS all marking time
under the flapping banner.

			CAB DRIVER 
	Whadda welcome! Will you lookit...
	Whadda welcome!

NICK stares at the approaching trailer.

			NICK 
	That's not it.

			CAB DRIVER 
	What're you, crazy? That's not
	it??? You said a trailer. You said--

			NICK 
	That's not it. Keep going. Go
	straight.

			CAB DRIVER 
	Hey, now listen. Now you said --

			NICK 
	I'm telling you that's not it! Now
	keep going!

NICK throws himself down on the floor.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Just keep going! Just keep going
	straight!

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK

LINDA is outside, standing with VINCE and ALBERT.

			VINCE 
	This is him. I'm telling you, this
	is Nick!

The TAXICAB comes thudding by. LINDA, VINCE and ALBERT all
watch as it disappears over a rise.

			ALBERT
		(to VINCE)
	I thought that was it.

			VINCE 
	So he's in the next one, Albert. I
	mean take it easy. I mean you're
	driving everybody nuts!

			VETS (V.O.)
		(singing raggedly)
	Three cheers for the red, white and
	blue...!

			VINCE
		(to LINDA)
	You okay?

LINDA gives a thin smile.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	It's gonna be the next one. Okay?

LINDA nods.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	It's gotta be the next one. I mean
	it's gotta be! Right, Albert?

			ALBERT
	Fuckin' A. It's gotta!

			VINCE
	It's gotta!

EXT. MOTEL - DUSK

A huge neon sign stands against the grey sky, buzzing
angrily, as if it were full of bees.

The TAXI DRIVER comes out of one of the units, gets back in
his cab and pulls away.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK

NICK stands in the doorway where the driver has left him. His
duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled
along the wall by his feet. His head is thrown back and he is
draining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw
swallows. .

NICK lowers the bottle, catches his breath and goes at it
again. This time, as he lowers the bottle, the stark panic is
gone, but there is still fear -- blind, nameless fear, like
that of an animal run to the ground.

NICK crosses to the window, grips the frame with both hands
and looks out.

EXT. THE STEEL MILL FROM THE MOTEL (NICK'S POV) - DUSK

The five great stacks trail ribbons of black smoke across the
pale winter sky, Steam billows upward in huge, silver-edged
clouds and there is the flash and gleam of fire.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK

NICK turns back to the room. He stares at it blankly --
stares at the bed, stares at the bureau, stares at the chair,
then he picks up the bottle, closes his eyes and begins
gulping down whiskey -- gulping it hard, fast, as hard and
fast as he can.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NEW ANGLE - DAWN

The banner stretching to the house across the street has been
whipped to shreds by the wind. In the yard, parked beside
NICK's black Cadillac, is another car of about the same
vintage. There is a case of beer on its roof, the windows are
entirely frosted over and the engine is running. After a
moment TWO STEELWORKERS come down the street and knock on the
trailer door. TWO OLDER WOMEN emerge, putting on their coats,
and then LINDA comes to the door and tells the STEELWORKERS
she has no news. The STEELWORKERS and the OLDER WOMEN start
off, but now one of the WOMEN points to the frosted up car.
The STEELWORKERS go back, pound on the roof of the frosted up
car, pull open a few doors and go on their way. First thing
out is a GIRL. Next thing out is a SECOND GIRL. Their dresses
are rumpled and half-undone. Neither one has a coat and the
SECOND GIRL is missing a shoe. The GIRLS both plunge back
inside the car, where howling and cursing can now be heard.
The GIRLS both retrieve their coats. The SECOND GIRL gets her
missing shoe, plus a bra and a pair of panties.
She returns the panties to the FIRST GIRL, puts on her shoe
and they both take off at a fast trot. As the two GIRLS leave
there is a cascade of empty beer cans and ALBERT, VINCE and
JOHN all stagger out -- bleary-eyed, hung-over, half
undressed and freezing. LINDA comes out of the trailer with
coffee, but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes
off. ALBERT and VINCE begin yelling at each other, yelling at
JOHN and yelling at LINDA. Then they throw themselves back in
the car and start off. The case of beer on the roof crashes
to the street. They stop, pile out, pick up the cans, heave
them in the back seat and take off again.

JOHN says something to LINDA and goes on his way.

LINDA stands in the yard, alone, with the three cups of
coffee.

EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN

NICK stands half-way down a rickety wooden stairway,
watching.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAWN

LINDA turns and goes back inside the trailer.

EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN

NICK swallows and starts down the stairway toward the
trailer. He hesitates, pulls the bottle from his pocket,
drains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs.
Straightening up, he claws at his hair, trying to comb it
with his fingers. Then he starts down again.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAWN

Cakes, cookies, six-packs of beer and bottles of wine cover
almost every inch of available space. LINDA sits on the
little settee, wedged between two cases of Coca-Cola and
hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with
painful slowness, to knit. LINDA is trying not to cry. She is
trying her God-damnedest.

There is a knock at the door. LINDA freezes. Then, trying to
be totally matter-of-fact, she puts down the sweater, crosses
to the door and opens it.

			NICK
	Guess who.

LINDA stares at him. NICK gives a little laugh and steps in.

			LINDA
		(throws herself in his
		arms)
	Nick! Oh, Nick, you're back!

She hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull
apart.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought
	you were hurt, some accident. Maybe
	you fell or maybe some car...
		(back in his arms)
	I thought someone stole you away!

			NICK 
	No.

			LINDA 
	Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!

They pull apart.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	How are you?

			NICK 
	Fine. I'm fine. How are you?

			LINDA 
	Fine. I just go along, you know.
	Down at the market. Back here. I
	mean it just seems there's a
	million things to do!... Are you
	sure you're all right? I mean, what
	about the wound?

			NICK 
		(anger)
	That was nothing. That wasn't
	anything.

			LINDA 
	But --

			NICK 
	It was just the complications. I
	mean, you take a little thing over
	there and then you get
	complications. I mean all the guys
	had it.

			LINDA 
	I made you a sweater. 
		(she gets it)
	Here... You have to take that off.

NICK removes his coat. LINDA pulls the sweater over him

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	I couldn't remember your exact
	size.

The sweater is huge, a great rumpled thing reaching almost to
NICK's knees.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
		(smoothly)
	Oh, that's fine. Perfect... It is a
	little too big... 
		(she pulls the sweater
		back off)
	... but I can easily fix that.
	Easily. One thing about wool
	sweaters, they are such a cinch to
	fix.

She crosses to a garbage pail out of NICK's line of sight and
stuffs the sweater in it.

			NICK 
	How's the trailer?

			LINDA 
	Great. Fine... Once or twice it did
	fall off the blocks. I don't know
	what that's from.

			NICK 
	Frost.

			LINDA 
	Is that what it is? I couldn't
	figure out.

			NICK 
	Did you get hurt? You didn't get
	hurt?

			LINDA 
	Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump.
	Would you like a Coke? You don't
	drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What
	about champagne? Let's have
	champagne! I don't think we have
	champagne. Let's have this. See?
	Sparkling. I'll get you an opener.
	Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's
	just have beer. Do you want some
	cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we
	should have coffee.

She begins to sob. CAMERA CLOSES ON HER FACE:

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Nick? I'm so glad you're alive! I'm
	so happy! I... I just don't know
	what to do!

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

NICK and LINDA are some distance away. NICK is shaking hands
with an ENTHUSIASTIC MAN while LINDA stands to one side,
watching his face, and so full of love that she seems about
to burst. ANOTHER MAN comes over. LINDA takes the MAN's arm
and presents him to NICK.

WE CANNOT HEAR WHAT IS BEING SAID. THE ONLY SOUND COMES FROM
THE MILL WHICH LOOMS UP BEHIND THEM OUT THE FROZEN VALLEY
BELOW.

INT. PIZZA PARLOR - TABLE BY WINDOW - DAY

NICK and LINDA sit opposite one another. Across the street a
coal train is rumbling slowly by and NICK is watching it. The
cars are black, interchangable, and they roll on and on.
Suddenly the last car appears. The car passes and there is
silence.

LINDA gives NICK a smile.

			NICK 
	It was all for nothing. Do you know
	that? It was all for nothing.

LINDA stares at him. She doesn't know what to say, how to
respond. NICK forces a grin, gestures with his hand and
shrugs. He picks up the check, stands.

			LINDA 
	Nick?... I just want to say how
	sorry I am about Sal and about
	Merle. How... I know you loved them
	and I know it's not the same. I
	mean now.

			NICK
	Naw, it's... I mean...

			LINDA 
	Maybe... I don't know, if you want
	to talk --

			NICK 
	Naw, it's... This guy wants his
	money.

INT. SUPERMARKET - BACK ROOM - DAY

The place is full of crates and boxes. ONE CREW is unloading
a tractor-trailer. ANOTHER CREW is stacking and unpacking.
NICK stands with LINDA and a red-faced, cigar-chewing MANAGER
who is pumping NICK's hand, slapping him on the back and
shouting orders all at the same time.

			MANAGER 
	You did a good job, kid. Pettrucio,
	here! You did a good job. Gimme a
	count on these pears! I think we
	got 'em now, know what I mean? The
	pears, the pears! Ask me, we got
	'em right by the balls, know what I
	mean? Have a cigar. The pears,
	Pettrucio, the pears!!!

He goes off.

			NICK
		(to Linda)
	Does this... I mean, how does this
	job work out?

			LINDA 
	Oh, it's great. Fine.

NICK nods. A STOCK BOY comes by and whistles.

			STOCK BOY 
	Hi you, hot lips.

			NICK 
	What do they... bother you!?

			LINDA
		(takes his arm, laughs)
	No-o-o!

			NICK 
	I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you,
	I'll kill 'em!

			LINDA 
		(gently)
	Nick. It's okay... It's okay.
		(gives him a squeeze,
		kisses him)
	I have to go now.

NICK nods.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Pick me up at eight.

NICK nods again. LINDA hurries off. The MANAGER comes in from
behind, clapping NICK on the shoulder and going for his ear

			MANAGER 
	That's one sweet little piece of
	ass. I'm telling you, that's one
	sweet little piece of ass. Who's
	got these pears, God damn it! Who's
	got the count on these goddamn
	pears!

EXT. STEEL MILL PARKING LOT - DAY

NICK stands by the entrance to the mill. It is cold and he
looks as if he had been waiting for some time. Suddenly
STEELWORKERS begin streaming out the doors, heading for their
cars. NICK cranes his neck and then he catches sight of
ALBERT and VINCE.

			NICK 
	Hey, Albert!

ALBERT turns. He grabs VINCE and pulls him through the
departing STEELWORKERS.

			VINCE 
	What the --!

			ALBERT 
	It's Nick!

			VINCE 
	Nick...?
		(sees him)
	Jesus, Nick!

VINCE grabs NICK's hand, shakes it. Then ALBERT does the
same.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Where the hell were you? We were
	all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am
	I right?

			ALBERT 
	Yeah.

			NICK 
	I got delayed. I --

			ALBERT
		(hugs him)
	Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you
	been doin', I mean...

			VINCE 
	Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants,
	Albert! I mean, what do you think?

			ALBERT 
	I know, but...

			VINCE 
	What do you think? You think he's
	been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's
	been saving your ass, Albert.
	Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!

			ALBERT 
	Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you
	must be tired.

			NICK 
	I'm fine. Hey, I'm fine.

THEY start for the cars.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	How're you guys... I mean, how've
	you guys been?

			VINCE 
	Same old thing. Hey, same like
	always. Nothing's changed. Albert
	is getting fat.

			ALBERT 
	Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got
	married! Vince got married!

			NICK 
	Married?

			ALBERT 
	Tell him, Vince.

			VINCE 
	Yeah. I did. Yeah...What the hell.

VINCE makes a gesture, shrugs.

			NICK 
		(after a beat)
	Well, who'd you get married to?

			VINCE 
	Aw, it's a long story!

			ALBERT 
	Tell him, Vince!

			VINCE 
	Well... you remember Cynthia?

			NICK 
	Cynthia! Sure.

			VINCE
		(nods)
	That's who.

			NICK 
		(fast recovery)
	Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I
	mean... Great! That's really great!

			ALBERT 
	Show him the gun. Hey, show him the
	gun, Vince.

VINCE looks around. Cars are streaming out of the lot, horns
blaring. VINCE pulls back his coat and shows a .38 Smith and
Weston in a holster on his hip.

			NICK 
	What the hell's that for?

			VINCE 
	What's it for??

			ALBERT 
	He's serious. Vince is fuckin'
	serious!

			NICK 
	You mean...?

			VINCE
	Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is
	for the guy that gets caught!

			ALBERT
	Vince thinks... you know...

			NICK 
		(nods)
	Hey... hey, let's drink!

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT

NICK comes through the CROWD OF STEELWORKERS shaking hands.
The STEELWORKERS treat him with immense respect. There are no
cracks; there are no jokes. They squeeze his shoulder, pat
his back, reaching out for him, touching him.

			STEELWORKERS 
	Nice going! Good going, Nick! You
	did good, boy; you did fine! Let
	him through! Damn good, boy! Let
	him through! He's all right! Did
	his part and he did it good! Let
	him through! Let's make a little
	room!

JOHN pushes out of the crowd.

			JOHN
	Nick! Hey, Nick!
		(gives him a big hug)
	Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay?
	You're okay, huh?

			NICK
	Fine. Hey, I'm fine.

			JOHN
	Sit down. Here. Right here.
		(calls)
	Albert! Vince!

JOHN pushes them all into a booth. A tray arrives loaded with
beer and shots of whiskey.

			JOHN (CONT'D)
	Here. Here we go.
		(he raises a beer)
	Here's to you, Nick!

			ALBERT
	Fuckin' A!

			VINCE
		(stands)
	Here's to Nick, you guys. He did
	his part. He did... what hadda be
	done... and so he did it... and
	here he is!!!

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT - LATER

NICK sits at the bar flanked by VINCE and ALBERT. Both VINCE
and ALBERT are completely glassed out. Behind, in the booths,
three or four STEELWORKERS are sleeping. JOHN moves around
behind the counter wiping things off.

			JOHN
	Rough, huh?

			NICK
	Rough.
		(he nods)
	We didn't have to do it, John.

			JOHN
	No?

			NICK
	No. How's Angela? How's she taking
	it?

			JOHN
	Not so good.

			NICK
	No?

			JOHN
	Worse since she talked to him.

			ALBERT
		(with a dull beery blink)
	Fucking A.

			NICK
	Worse since she talked to who?

			JOHN
	Sal.

			NICK
	Talked to Sal?
		(stares at him)
	Sal's alive?

			JOHN
	Kind of. You didn't know?

			NICK
		(pushes off the counter)
	Sal's alive???

JOHN, ALBERT and VINCE exchange glances, nod.

			ALBERT
	He's real bad, Nick.

			NICK
		(stares at them)
	Well, where the hell is he!!! I
	mean what are we all sitting here
	for!!!
		(tears begin streaming
		down his face)
	WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???

			ALBERT 
	Nick...

			VINCE 
	Hey, Nick...

			JOHN 
	Nick, we don't know where Sal is...
	Nick, Angela won't tell us.

			NICK 
	Why?... What do you mean?... Why???

			JOHN 
	Nick, she won't say why.

			NICK 
	But Sal's mother! What about Sal's
	mother!

			JOHN 
	She's out of her tree, Nick. She is
	straight out of her tree.

			NICK 
		(stares at them)
	Oh, Jesus.

He walks in a circle and then stops, staring at them.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Oh, Jesus!!!

NICK turns and goes out.

INT. SAL'S HOUSE - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT

The room is very dark. ANGELA sits at a lace-covered table by
the window where a street lamp illuminates her in an eerie
glow. ANGELA holds a portable radio in tier hand, a very tiny
one, and she fiddles with the dial, going from one station to
another.

There is a sound from the hallway, then SAL'S MOTHER comes in
with NICK.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	I know I know you. So familiar.
	Such a familiar face. Oh, I know
	now! The toaster man! I'll go and
	get it for you.

SAL'S MOTHER goes out. ANGELA lights up a cigarette.

			ANGELA 
	You're back.

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			ANGELA 
	I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very
	glad.

			NICK 
	Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.

			ANGELA 
	Sure. Why not.

			NICK 
	Where? Where is he?

			ANGELA 
	Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital
	and they're fixing him up.

			NICK 
	You talk to him?

			ANGELA 
	Oh, sure... Twice a day.

			NICK 
	What hospital is he in? Where?

			ANGELA 
	Nick... Sal is very weak. He
	suffered a severe wound... and
	right now he doesn't want a whole
	lot of people to get involved in a
	whole thing.

			NICK 
	Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a
	long way.

			ANGELA 
	He doesn't want people bugging him,
	Nick!

ANGELA begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands
up.

She stares at NICK for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and
writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. NICK
comes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and
stands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the
piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.

			NICK 
	Angela...?

ANGELA laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding
NICK's eyes.

			ANGELA 
	Did you ever think life would turn
	out like this?

			NICK 
	No.

			ANGELA 
	You know what Sal's got now?...
	Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and...
	that's it.

The door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in
with an electric toaster and a screwdriver.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	Here. This is it. What you do, you
	stick this in here.

Pushes the toaster in NICK's arms.

			SAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
	Then you jab it, see. Jab it good.
	Something's in it. Hear? Listen.
	Something's in it. What? What's
	there?

EXT. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

NICK sits on the steps with the toaster that Sal's mother
gave him in his lap. It is snowing and from inside the church
we hear the CHOIR SINGING. The sound is massive, deep and
dark, like a great river rolling through the night.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK. He is staring at something, tears
glistening in his eyes.

EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - REVERSE ANGLE (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

We see a lone telephone booth at the curb. The door is half
open and snow is blowing in.

EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - ORIGINAL ANGLE - NIGHT

NICK closes his eyes, leans his head forward and takes it in
his hands.

INT. MOTEL NICK'S UNIT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

LINDA steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself.

			LINDA 
	It just seems sort of strange
	coming to a motel... Like a
	honeymoon. Or some kind of parlez
	vous ... Not parlez-vous!
		(she giggles)
	What am I saying? That's those
	cocktails! Parlez-vous!... What I
	mean is rendezvous. Some kind of
	rendezvous.

LINDA pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at
herself in the mirror. She is very excited, very nervous. She
strikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and
poking a finger in her mouth.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Do you know what I mean?... Nick?

NICK doesn't answer. LINDA pulls the door full open, takes
one last look at herself and goes out.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

As LINDA comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she
stops dead in her tracks.

NICK is lying on the bed -- sprawled on his back, one shoe
off and sound asleep.

			LINDA 
	Nick?

NICK doesn't stir, doesn't budge. LINDA crosses and looks at
him -- hungrily, top to bottom -- then she gives his toe a
wistful shake.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Nick...? Nick, it's me!

But NICK is out, gone. LINDA lets out a little moan and sits
down on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately,
she stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off
his shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his
shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a
fresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she
slowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest.

NICK'S CHEST IS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF TERRIFYING FRESH
SCARS. THE SCARS ARE RAISED; THEY ARE INTER-CONNECTED AND
STUDDED WITH ANGRY SUTURE MARKS, LIKE A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF
SOME UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND.

CAMERA HOLDS ON LINDA'S FACE.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STEEL MILL - CASTING ROOM - DAY

NICK stands at the handle of a long metal rod. At the other
end of the rod ALBERT and VINCE are attaching metallic
strips. When ALBERT and VINCE have secured the strips they
signal to NICK and all three of them lower their goggles.

CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. NICK is standing below a furnace
which is seven stories high, towering above him into a maze
of cat-walks and monstrous steel-hipped cranes.

ALBERT and VINCE give a signal and the CRANE OPERATOR raises
the door at the bottom of the furnace. NICK is now alone,
standing like Don Quixote with his lance. As NICK advances
toward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of
his asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have
stuck to it burst into flame. Within reach of the furnace
now, NICK pauses. Then, lifting the metal rod, he jams it
through the open doorway at the base of the furnace. There is
a white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a
geyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the
doorway, passing NICK at the level of his shoulders and
showering him in a great cascade of white sparks.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT

NICK sits at the bar, silent, hunched over a beer, lost in
thought. All around him STEELWORKERS are shouting, yelling,
cracking jokes. After a moment VINCE pushes in, claps him on
the back.

			VINCE 
	How's it feel, huh? How's it feel
	to be back?

			NICK
		(forced enthusiasm)
	Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!

			VINCE 
	I mean, I guess you still think
	about Nam. Right? I mean --

			NICK 
	Naw.
		(shakes his head)
	Uh-huh.

			VINCE 
	Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one
	of those slants?

			NICK 
	No.

			VINCE 
	No!

			NICK 
	Never one.

			VINCE 
	Oh, Jesus!
		(looks around)
	You're kiddin'!

			NICK 
	One, Vince... you have to
	understand, doing it with one...
	would be... like nothing. They're
	small, see, so if you're smart you
	get about six or eight. I mean, if
	you want to have any fun.

			VINCE 
	Six or eight.
		(nods) 
	And they go wild?

			NICK 
		(lowers his voice)
	They have these little sticks,
	Vince. They call them "chomp
	chomps", and when you get these
	girls going, you have to stick 'em
	in their mouths.

VINCE stares at NICK. His respiration is up, his mouth is
bone dry and his eyes are as big as saucers. For a moment his
belief is total, then a frown crosses his face.

			VINCE 
	You're full of shit!

			NICK 
		(nods)
	Yeah.

			VINCE
		(pounding him on the head)
	And I believed you! I oughta punch
	you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey,
	let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey,
	Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do
	you say? Nick? What do you say?

			NICK 
	Sure.

			ALBERT 
	Hey! Fuckin' A! Hey!

He spots JOHN passing with a tray of beer.

			ALBERT (CONT'D)
	Hey, John!

ALBERT scoops JOHN into his arms where he holds him from
behind.

			JOHN
	Yes, Albert?

			ALBERT
		(into his ear)
	John,we're going huntin'.

			JOHN 
	Who's going?

			ALBERT
	We're all going.

			JOHN
	Nick's going?

			ALBERT
	Nick, Vince, Albert and John.

			JOHN 
	No women?

			OTHERS 
	No! No women! Jesus! What are you,
	crazy?

			JOHN 
	Take these beers.

They all take a beer. JOHN raises his glass, solemnly.

			JOHN (CONT'D)
	Here's to huntin'.

			ALBERT 
	Hey! Fuckin' A!

			VINCE
		(hopping up and down)
	Just like always! Just like it
	always was! Right, Nick? Am I
	right?

			NICK 
	In the timeless words of Squire
	Albert...

VINCE cracks up, howling.

			VINCE 
	Squire Albert...

VINCE collapses on the floor.

			NICK
	In the timeless words of Squire
	Albert...

			ALL
		(in a ragged chorus)
	Hey! Fuckin' A!!!

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. His
hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he
is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the
window by a street light on the corner. There is a sound
outside, then the lights come on as LINDA enters with
groceries.

			LINDA
	Nick?

			NICK
	Right here.

LINDA crosses to the doorway.

			LINDA
	What are you doing?

			NICK
	Oh. Nothing... Sitting.

			LINDA
	You're going hunting?

			NICK
		(blankly)
	What?

			LINDA
	I see you're going hunting.

NICK looks at the equipment on the floor.

			NICK
	Yeah... All the guys, we're all
	going huntin'. Like we did. You
	know? Like we always used to.

			LINDA 
	That's wonderful. I think you
	should... fresh air.

NICK gets to his feet, suddenly. His face is twisted with
pain and his voice is cracked with emotion.

			NICK 
	You know how sometimes you're going
	along... You're going along... And
	that's all...! One thing is right
	after another, like steps... And
	you step along.

NICK can hardly breathe. It is as if he were choking.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	I don't know where that is... It's
	gone! That's gone!

A car pulls up outside. The HORN begins blowing, then VINCE
and ALBERT begin pounding on the wall of the trailer.

			VINCE (V.O.) 
	Let's go!!!

			ALBERT (V.O.) 
	Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!

			NICK 
	I gotta go.

NICK swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and
heads for the door. LINDA follows, still clutching her
groceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	I'll be... I don't know... Couple
	of days.

NICK IS GONE. LINDA STANDS MOTIONLESS, CLUTCHING HER
GROCERIES, STARING AT THE TRAILER DOOR. IT IS DARK OUTSIDE.
SNOW IS BLOWING IN. THE DOOR CLOSES SLOWLY, WITH A FAINT
HISS, AND THEN CLICKS SHUT.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST - DAY

Snow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice
covered trees. There is no horizon. Sky and earth are bound
in a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the
whispering, fitful, spinning flakes.

NICK appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting
snow. NICK is moving easily, heading slightly uphill,
following the contour of the slope. As he draws closer we see
that he is following a SET OF FRESH TRACKS.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOODS - ROCK LEDGE - DAY

A magnificent SEVEN POINT BUCK stands by a grove of hemlocks,
looking down the slope.

NICK appears below, barely visible in the swirling snow.

The BUCK watches NICK for a moment, then turns unhurriedly
and vanishes into the trees.

EXT. RIDGE NEAR CAMP - DAY

VINCE is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on
all fours. JOHN and ALBERT, who have reached a level area
above VINCE, unsling their rifles. SHOTS are going off in
every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that
it sounds like a full scale war.

			VINCE 
	What are you, kiddin'? Are you
	kiddin' me, Albert? Twenty times I
	coulda had her! She...! One time
	she begged me, practically begged
	me. Listen, I had her tit, which
	was out, in one hand, and my other
	hand... You know that mole on the
	inside of her right leg? Well, I
	was past that mole, way past that
	mole, and I was --

JOHN nudges ALBERT. FOUR DEER are coming down the slope,
single file. JOHN and ALBERT raise their rifles and FIRE. TWO
OF THE DEER FALL AND THE REMAINING TAKE OFF. VINCE, who is
just getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls
down. JOHN and ALBERT drag VINCE to his feet and then rush
over to the TWO DEAD DEER.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(coming after them)
	Nice shootin', you guys. Not bad.
	Not half bad.

Leans his rifle on the horns of one of the fallen DEER.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	'Course how could you miss, right?
	Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean,
	if I'd'a been where you guys were --

			JOHN 
	Psst. Vince!

JOHN signals with his head. VINCE turns. ANOTHER DEER has
come out of the woods. The DEER is rattled by the gunfire and
peers at VINCE uncertainly. VINCE spins and grabs his gun,
which immediately goes off. He slams another shell in the
chamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is
hooked on the antlers of the DEAD DEER and another shot
ricochets off a nearby rock. JOHN and ALBERT dive for cover.
As they look up, they see the DEER trot down the slope and
then VINCE, firing wildly, running after it.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY

The wind is much stronger, moaning in the trees. NICK
appears, moving fast, at a near trot. Suddenly he stops,
listening. At the same moment there is a snort. NICK wheels.
The BUCK is behind him, bounding away.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY

The BUCK appears, trotting out of the swirling snow. Reaching
a deadfall the BUCK pauses, looking back, and then turns
sharp left and disappears.

NICK comes out of the snow. He is winded but still going
hard.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DEADFALL - DAY

NICK reaches the deadfall, hesitates, then rapidly springs
over. As he touches down on the other side there is a
growling sound.

NICK grabs for the deadfall. The wind shifts and we see that
he has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the
top of a steep scree slope. As NICK watches, the boulder
begins to roll, then to bound, dislodging other rocks and
boulders, all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking...
and then falling -- soundless -- over a sheer ledge to
unknown depths below.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY

ALBERT and JOHN have dragged their TWO DEAD DEER to a log
beside the shack. They sit side by side, drenched in sweat,
guzzling beer out of both hands.

			JOHN
	Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!

			ALBERT 
	Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a
	hot shit... except cold.

JOHN lowers his beer. ALBERT gives him a blank expression,
then cracks up. SHOTS explode nearby. At first the shots are
scattered but they quickly open into a FULL BARRAGE. ALBERT
and JOHN stand up.

EXT. HIGHWAY EMBANKMENT - DAY

The DEER that VINCE was chasing earlier comes hobbling out of
the woods pursued by a GROUP OF HALF-DRUNK HUNTERS. VINCE
comes barreling through the HUNTERS, shouting and screaming.
VINCE's clothes are in tatters, the sole is gone from one
shoe and the barrel of his rifle is jammed up with mud and
perceptibly bent.

			VINCE 
	I got this one!!! This one's
	mine!!!

VINCE loses his footing and rolls down the embankment, head
over heels.

EXT. DITCH - DAY

VINCE comes up ten feet from the bewildered DEER. He raises
his rifle, fires, and the BARREL SPLITS OPEN. SHOTS begin
coming in, thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks. The
DEER wheels out on the highway. VINCE heaves his rifle at the
DEER, draws his pistol...

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Cars are parked on both sides of the road. HUNTERS are
sitting in the cars, drinking, eating sandwiches and warming
themselves at small fires. MORE HUNTERS are up on the
embankment.

			VINCE 
	I got this one!!! This one's
	mine!!!

The panicked DEER bolts down the highway between the parked
cars. The HUNTERS ON THE EMBANKMENT open fire. The HUNTERS IN
THE CARS dive for cover.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Hold your fire! I got this one!!!

VINCE FIRES, FIRES AGAIN. SHOTS are ringing everywhere.
HUNTERS are shouting, running, yelling. A car window goes
out, a headlight goes out. The DEER is hit, falls and gets
up. VINCE takes aim. A FLEEING HUNTER bowls him over. The
DEER bolts for the woods, bullets smashing all around it.
VINCE scrambles to his feet and plunges after it.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	I got it! I got this one!

EXT. WOODS - DAY

The DEER staggers through the trees, blood pouring from its
wounds. VINCE comes stumbling after it. HE FIRES, FIRES
AGAIN.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY

ALBERT and JOHN stand with their beers, looking into the
woods. A shot zings by, close, and they dive behind a log.

The DEER comes out of the woods, barely able to keep moving.
VINCE appears, reeling. He takes aim at the DEER and there is
a DULL CLICK. VINCE jams his pistol back in his holster.

			VINCE 
	Gun! Gimme gun!!!

ALBERT indicates his rifle. VINCE stumbles over to it, rams a
cartridge in the chamber.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(looks around, bewildered)
	Where's it gone?

			JOHN 
	Inside, Vince.

VINCE staggers to the cabin door. The DEER is lying on the
floor, motionless, DEAD.

			VINCE 
	I got it! Hey, you guys, I got
	it!!!

EXT. MOUNTAINS - FROZEN LAKE - DAY

The wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way
and then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black
speck in the endless expanse of shifting white.

As NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His
clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow
gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK
APPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are
no tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in
the driving snow.

The wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in
again from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the
silence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock.

NICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty
feet away, looking down at him.

NICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights
down the barrel.

WE SEE THE BUCK THROUGH NICK'S SIGHTS. IT IS A CLEAR SHOT.
NICK'S FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER. HE HAS ONLY TO SQUEEZE IT.

NICK LOWERS HIS RIFLE. THE BUCK SNORTS, TOSSES HIS HORNS AND
DISAPPEARS IN THE SLANTING SNOW.

NICK STANDS MOTIONLESS, STARING AFTER IT, SO WONDER-STRUCK HE
HAS FORGOTTEN TO BREATHE.

			NICK
		(grins)
	Damn... God damn...

EXT. MOUNTAINS - OVERLOOK - DAY

NICK sits on his haunches with his back against a sheer rock
face. As he devours a Hostess Twinkie he looks out over a
snow-shrouded landscape of such spectacular beauty that it
might be something from a dream.

			NICK 
		(shouts)
	Hey! Hey... okay!

INT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

The Coleman lantern hangs from the rafter, rocking in the
wind. NICK is propped against the wall, dozing. JOHN is out
cold. ALBERT and VINCE are both drunk and arguing bitterly.

			ALBERT 
	You're full of shit, Vince! You're
	so full of shit you're going to
	float away!

			VINCE 
	Who? Who is?

			ALBERT 
	You, Vince! You! You are! You're a
	crock! You're a walking, talking
	crock!... I mean, what do you know?

			VINCE 
	I know! I fuckin' know!

			ALBERT 
	You don't!

			VINCE 
	I do!!!

			ALBERT 
	I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince!
	With twenty guys you know!

			VINCE 
	She does not!

			ALBERT 
	Then what's the gun for! What's
	this for?

			VINCE 
	In case!!! The gun's in case!!!

			ALBERT 
	In case???!!! In case of what? In
	case you stumble on her, suckin'
	cock in the front fucking hall?!

			VINCE 
	She might!!! She might do it,
	Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell
	me that she does!!!

			ALBERT 
	She does, Vince! That's what I'm
	telling you! She does!!!

VINCE is sheet-white, trembling. He grabs up the pistol and
cocks it.

			VINCE
		(shrieking)
	Say that one more time!... Say
	it!!! Go on, say it!!!

NICK is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at
the pistol in disbelief. Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun
with one hand and slams VINCE to the floor. VINCE gets up.
NICK slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and
begins pounding his head against the wall. ALBERT lurches
over, pulls NICK away.

			ALBERT 
	Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!...
	Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince
	goes back a long way.

			NICK
		(grimly)
	Yeah.

VINCE gets to his feet. Blood is streaming down his face.

			VINCE 
	What the hell was that!
		(picks up the pistol)
	What did you think? Did you think
	it was loaded!

			NICK 
	You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!

			VINCE 
	The fuck I did!!!

			NICK 
	The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!

NICK takes the pistol.

			VINCE 
	What do you think? You think I
	don't know!!!

NICK looks at him, then he EMPTIES THE PISTOL INTO THE FLOOR.

For a moment there is absolute silence. The wind moans in the
trees, snow curls through the open door and JOHN, who is
still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore.

NICK looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands...

			NICK 
	I'm going to throw this fuckin'
	thing away.

NICK goes out.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

For a moment NICK stands in the light from the door,
listening to the wind. He looks down at the pistol again,
then he heaves it into the trees.

The wind gusts. The snow swirls and hisses, slipping through
the woods in great streaming wraiths.

NICK watches it for a moment, then he turns and goes back in.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK

The trailer is lonely looking, DARK and cold. VINCE pulls
into the yard beside NICK's car and skips to a stop. NICK
gets out, says a few words to VINCE and everyone laughs. NICK
goes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and
pounds on the car. VINCE takes off, thudding over the curb
with his load of THREE DEAD DEER.

NICK crosses to the trailer and goes inside.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

TWO DOZEN AMPUTEES in wheelchairs are watching a western.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

In the foreground a NURSE holds a telephone. Beyond the NURSE
we see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down
the polished corridor. As the figure draws closer we realize
it is SAL. SAL is dressed in a white hospital gown, the
bottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and
trails limply on the floor. Both SAL's legs have been
amputated and he has lost one arm. His face is terribly
scarred and what expression he displays is centered in his
eyes.

SAL takes the telephone. THE SOUNDTRACK FROM THE MOVIE IN THE
RECREATION ROOM IS VERY LOUD.

			SAL
	Hello?

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK sits in a little chair by the window, still in his
hunting clothes, huddled anxiously over the receiver.

			NICK
	Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.

			SAL
	Nick. Hey. How's things?

			NICK
	Oh. You know. How's it with you?

			SAL 
	Same. Hey. Same old stuff.

			NICK 
		(he can hardly hear)
	What's that noise?

			SAL 
	What?

			NICK 
	What's that noise?

			SAL 
	John Wayne... Listen, Nick --

			NICK 
	Great. Hey. That's great.

			SAL 
	Listen, Nick --

			NICK 
	John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal.
	Jesus. When are you getting out?

			SAL 
	I'm gonna stay here, Nick.

			NICK 
		(hearing it)
	What?

			SAL
		(with everything he has)
	Place is great. Really. One great
	place... Basketball, bowling. You
	name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of
	guys are making salad bowls. What
	I'll do is make a salad bowl for
	you, unless you'd rather have a
	pencil holder. The pencil holder's
	neat, I mean --

			NICK 
	Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John
	Wayne's making so much noise I can
	hardly --

			SAL 
	I gotta get back, Nick.

SAL looks around in desperation.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	They're passing out popcorn now, so
	I'll be talking to you... maybe
	next year.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK holds the receiver, staring into it. There is the SOUND
OF WHOOPING, GRUNTING, THUNDERING HOOVES...

			NICK 
	Sal?... Sal?

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

SAL is wheeling himself rapidly down the polished corridor.
At the doorway to the recreation room he pauses, looking back
at the DANGLING RECEIVER. Then he turns and disappears into
the flickering darkness, where BUGLES are sounding a cavalry
charge.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK listens to the SOUND OF THE BUGLES for a moment, then
puts the receiver back on the telephone. He stands, walks
around in a little circle - pained, terribly upset. His eye
falls on the clock. It is nearly eight o'clock. He turns,
hurries out the door.

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping
carts which a CLERK is banging together.

NICK gets out of his car and goes in.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Two or three CHECKERS are closing out the registers up front.

			CHECKER 
	She's in back.

			NICK 
	Thanks.

			CHECKER 
	How was huntin'?

			NICK 
	Oh. Fine.

			CHECKER 
	Get anything?

			NICK 
	No.

			CHECKER 
	Too bad.

NICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at
the back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair,
crying.

			NICK 
	Linda... Honey, what's wrong?

			LINDA
		(helpless shrug)
	I don't know.

			NICK 
	Hey. Look. There must be something.

LINDA looks at him, tears streaming down her face.

			LINDA 
	I'm just so lonely.

			NICK 
	C'mon. I've got the car.

			LINDA 
		(shakes her head)
	I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll
	be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.

NICK walks back down the aisle between the bright packages.

INT. NICK'S CAR - SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The CLERK is still collecting abandoned shopping carts. The
carts crash and clank as the CLERK rams them together.

NICK sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk. His hands
begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car.

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NICK'S CAR - NIGHT

NICK watches the lights go out in the market. LINDA comes out
of the door and crosses towards him.

			NICK
	You okay?

LINDA nods. NICK fumbles for the door.

			LINDA
	Let's make love, Nick.

LINDA takes him in her arms and holds him tight.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Let's make love forever!

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

LINDA is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across
the pillows, like a dancer leaping.

NICK stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking
down at her. After a moment he draws the covers over her,
fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then
goes to the window.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

The wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the
frozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN
appears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly
dressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest,
polished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the
light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer.

THE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY
SIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY.

THE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT,
THEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK backs away from the window. For a moment he stands
motionless, hardly able to believe his eyes. He looks over at
LINDA, he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to
the window again.

EXT. STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

The street is empty. The MAN is gone.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK hesitates, then he sheds the blanket and pulls on pants,
shirt, jacket and jams his sockless feet into a pair of
slices.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK comes out into the street. There is no one in sight.

NICK crosses to the intersection of Columbine.

EXT. INTERSECTION OF COLUMBINE - NIGHT

No one. Nothing. A beer can rolling in the wind.

NICK jams himself against a wall, zippers his jacket. He is
irked with himself, a little frightened. Suddenly he hears a
car door close and en engine start up. A black limousine
pulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly. A
CHAUFFEUR is at the wheel.
The PASSENGER in back appears to be the MAN he saw, but the
MAN is looking out the window on the other side and his face
is not visible.

As NICK watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed. The
tail lights grow small, then the car dips over a hill and
disappears.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Sunlight streams through a window. The television is going.
In a far corner SAL sits in his wheelchair, sleeping.

CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON SAL. His head has fallen to one side
and his single arm sticks into the air -- as if he had failed
in his grasp of something, as if he were drowning. On a tray
in front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice,
milk and a little box of Wheaties.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY

Someone is descending the stairs. After a moment the feet
appear, clad in expensive cowboy boots. We see expensive,
tailor-made trousers, a belt buckle embossed with a six
shooter... and then, suddenly, MERLE'S FACE.

MERLE slows in his descent, stops, looking at something.

EXT. V.A. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE (MERLE'S POV) - DAY

NICK is getting out of a cab. He pays the driver and starts
toward the building.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY

MERLE watches NICK for a moment, his face utterly without
expression, then MERLE continues down the stairs.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY

NICK is pushing SAL down a walkway.

			NICK 
	Sal, we need you. We need you.

			SAL 
	Hey, Nick. How can you need me?

			NICK 
	We do, Sal. We do... You're the
	heart.

Turns SAL and sits on a bench.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna
	sit in that corner watching soaps
	and you're gonna die!... I'm not
	saying it's gonna be the same. It's
	not gonna be the same, but whatever
	it's gonna be we're all gonna do
	it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are
	gonna do it!

			SAL 
	Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin'
	scared to go home.

			NICK 
		(nods)
	I know. It's like coming from the
	moon. Or Mars.

SAL laughs.

			SAL 
	Did you go hunting.

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			SAL 
	Did you get one?

			NICK 
	No.

			SAL 
	You didn't get a deer?

			NICK 
	I tracked this one, a big buck.
	God, he was such a beauty--! What's
	this suitcase here?

			SAL 
	Where?

			NICK 
	Here. Behind you.

NICK pulls a suitcase off the rack behind SAL's chair.

			SAL 
	I don't know.

NICK sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the
clasps.

			NICK
	Maybe Angela brought you stuff. I
	know she said --

The suitcase slips over the back of the wall.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Shit!

NICK swings up on the wall and then he freezes. The lid of
the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are
scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment.

			SAL 
	Mom keeps sending me socks, Nick. I
	mean, if it's socks or something
	just let 'em go.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - EMBANKMENT WITH MONEY - DAY

NICK looks down at the money scattered at his feet. The
bundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere.

			SAL (V.O.)
	Maybe you could use socks, Nick.
	Jesus, I mean, come to think of it
	socks are pretty expensive now.

			NICK 
	It's not socks, Sal.

NICK bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking
for identification. There is nothing. As he straightens up he
notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the
bundles of bills.

The paper is about an inch square. The corners are tattered
and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket
for a long time.

NICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and
unfolds it.

THE CARD READS "EXHIBITIONS". IT CONTAINS A TELEPHONE NUMBER
ON THE LOWER LEFT CORNER AND IS IDENTICAL TO THE CARD ARMAND
GAVE TO NICK WHEN HE CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN BEHIND HIS
ROULETTE GAME IN SAIGON.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - VALLEY OVERLOOK - DAY

NICK leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable
cars of a coal train roll slowly by. SAL sits with the
suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying.

			SAL 
	Who is it, Nick? Who is it? I don't
	understand.

NICK looks at SAL. His head is spinning and he brings himself
back with effort.

			NICK 
	It's Merle, Sal.

			SAL
	Merle? ... Merle's alive?
		(NICK nods)
	How do you know?

			NICK 
	I saw him last night. I thought I
	was dreaming. I thought I was out
	of my mind.

			SAL 
	Merle gave me this?

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			SAL 
	But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where
	would a guy like Merle get money
	like this?

NICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the
money. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly
overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he
maintains a casual tone.

			NICK 
	Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's
	getting cold, Sal. I'm going to
	take you in.
		(starts off)
	We'll call Angela. The guys can
	help her bring you home... Did I
	tell you I was going on a trip?

			SAL 
		(panicked)
	Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You
	said you'd be --

			NICK 
	It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a
	week. Just to see Phantom Mary.

			SAL 
	Phantom Mary?

			NICK 
	Didn't I ever tell you about
	Phantom Mary?

			SAL 
		(laughs)
	No. 

			NICK
		(starts off again)
	Well... Phantom Mary's on my
	mother's side. Naturally no one
	there admits it because Phantom
	Mary's pretty weird... You want to
	hear the whole story?

			SAL
		(enthusiastically)
	Yeah!

			NICK 
	Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty
	weird... Lives alone, lives way out
	in the middle of nowhere with a cat
	called Pajamas and a cow called
	Fred. Well, last week I got a call
	from Phantom Mary, which in itself
	was very strange...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - U.S. ARMY AIRFIELD - TEXAS - DAY

The place is a madhouse of activity. As jets scream overhead
TROOPS embarking for Saigon are being counted and recounted.
SERGEANTS are yelling off names. CLERKS are typing forms and
papers. Forklift trucks weave in and out, DRIVERS cursing.

NICK is back in uniform. He stands at a window watching a jet
transport being prepared for loading. A CLERK comes by,
arguing with a SERGEANT. The CLERK sets down his clipboard to
consult the SERGEANT's papers. NICK picks up the clipboard
and moves into the CROWD.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - ANOTHER LOCATION - DAY

NICK spots a lone SECOND LIEUTENANT sitting on his gear. More
OFFICERS are waiting nearby but the SECOND LIEUTENANT seems
not to know them.

NICK moves in close enough to read the SECOND LIEUTENANT's
name tag.

			NICK
		(bawling)
	Biederman! Where's Biederman!

			LIEUTENANT 
	Here.

			NICK 
	You Biederman?

			LIEUTENANT 
	Biederman, yes.

			NICK 
	I got you on this flight,
	Biederman. Is that right?

			BIEDERMAN 
	Correct.

			NICK 
	Follow me, please.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

NICK walks along briskly with the LIEUTENANT at his side.

			NICK 
	Right this way.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

NICK comes to a door, opens it.

			NICK 
	Through here.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY

The LIEUTENANT walks into the closet and comes to a stop,
looking puzzled. NICK comes in behind him, closes the door
and picks up a length of pipe.

			NICK
	Take off the uniform.

The LIEUTENANT stares at NICK, dumbfounded.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Take off the uniform, Lieutenant!

The LIEUTENANT nods, begins taking off his uniform.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY

NICK has changed into the LIEUTENANT's uniform and tied him
to a chair. The LIEUTENANT is in tears. NICK is going through
his orders.

			LIEUTENANT 
	Please! Please mister, please! This
	is vital I go to Saigon. This is
	very important. Most important.

			NICK
		(exasperated)
	Listen, Biederman, I'm going to
	club you into the floor unless you
	tell me what the fuck is so
	important.

			LIEUTENANT 
	That I must not tell you. Top
	secret. You see there. Topmost
	secret.

			NICK 
	Biederman!

			LIEUTENANT
		(stiffly)
	I will not betray my country. No.
	Ne-ver!

NICK throws down the pipe in disgust, whips a gag around the
LIEUTENANT's mouth and ties it.

			NICK 
	When I get to Saigon I'll tell 'em
	where you are.

Slams the door.

EXT. SAIGON AIRPORT - TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT

Viet Cong SAPPERS have just attacked. A number of jet
fighters are burning, bodies are strewn over the tarmac and
jeeps with SOLDIERS are racing back and forth.
Out beyond, the jet transport taxis into view, lumbering like
a great silver monster out of the night.

INT. JET TRANSPORT - NIGHT

NICK stands in the aisle next to a COLONEL who is peering out
the window.

			COLONEL 
	Jesus Christ, they hit the airport!

NICK nods.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	Those fuckin' niggers. This time
	I'm going to eat balls!... You ever
	try 'em?

			NICK 
	Naw.

			COLONEL 
		(leans close)
	Not bad fresh, but they don't keep
	worth a pig's fart.

NICK nods. EVERYONE starts out.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	Lotta guys don't know that.
		(winks)
	Assholes!

EXT. JET TRANSPORT - DEBARKATION RAMP - NIGHT

A SIREN is screaming in the distance. NICK looks around
nervously. The COLONEL is still right in beside him.

			COLONEL 
	Tell you something else. Don't eat
	'em in the damn Delta. Unless you
	like 'em fishy... Some do. I don't.
	I never did.

The scream of the SIREN grows louder. Suddenly a Jeep careens
around the corner followed by a huge black Cadillac flying
American flags on the fenders. Both vehicles screech to a
stop and an MP jumps out of the jeep with a loud hailer.

			MP 
		(amplified)
	Lieutenant Biederman! Lieutenant
	Biederman report to the ramp!

			COLONEL 
	That's you.
		(grabs NICK's arm and
		waves)
	Right here, Sergeant! He's right
	here!

			MP 
	Right this way, Lieutenant.

NICK is hurried to the limousine where a SECOND MP holds the
door.

			SECOND MP 
	Quick as you can, sir. We're in a
	rush.

NICK gets in the limousine. The SECOND MP slams the door,
jumps in the front and they take off with sirens wailing.

INT. LIMOUSINE - SAIGON - NIGHT

There are jeeps with MP's ahead; there are jeeps with MP's
behind. Seated beside NICK is a gigantic MARINE CORPORAL who
stares rigidly ahead.

EXT. CAVALCADE - SAIGON - NIGHT

Pedestrians and bicyclists flee as the cavalcade comes
screaming down a wide boulevard.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - SAIGON - NIGHT

The jeeps peel off to the side. The gate swings open and the
limousine enters the compound.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

A STRING QUARTET is playing. GUESTS in evening clothes are
drinking champagne.

NICK enters with the MARINE CORPORAL and is whisked rapidly
down a hallway.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - KITCHEN - NIGHT

NICK stands in front of a huge range staring down at a table.
On the table there is a basket of eggs, an omelette pan and a
pile of mushrooms. Across from the table six SERVANTS with
napkins on their arms stand waiting with plates.

			MARINE (V.O.) 
	Sir?

NICK turns. The MARINE CORPORAL is holding a chef's hat. NICK
takes off his cap, puts on the chef's hat. Suddenly a door
comes open and the AMERICAN AMBASSADOR and his WIFE come in.

			AMBASSADOR 
	Henri! So good to see you. How are
	you? How are you? Darling, this is
	Henri. Henri, my wife Elizabeth.

			WIFE 
	My pleasure.

			AMBASSADOR
	Henri, we are starved. Six
	omelettes, s'il vous plait.

			WIFE
		(hissing)
	Avec champignons.

			AMBASSADOR
	Avec champignons.
		(back to his WIFE)
	Fines herbes?

The WIFE shakes her head. The AMBASSADOR winks.

			AMBASSADOR (CONT'D)
	Avec champignons.

The AMBASSADOR and his WIFE hurry out. There is dead silence.
NICK pulls the MARINE CORPORAL to one side, points to his
crotch.

			NICK
	Pee-pee.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT

NICK comes down the corridor behind the MARINE CORPORAL. As
he passes a straight-back chair standing against the wall he
picks it up and swings it down on the MARINE CORPORAL'S head.
The blow is ferocious. The chair splinters into pieces and
the MARINE CORPORAL goes down with a dull thud.

NICK stands for a moment, looking at him. Then he kneels,
removes his pistol and jams it in his belt.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - WALKWAY TO PEDESTRIAN EXIT - NIGHT

Three MARINE GUARDS are standing at parade rest by an open
iron gate.
As NICK appears in his white chef's hat the GUARDS snap to
attention and he walks into the CROWD OF ASIANS streaming by
outside.

EXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - BUSY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

NICK takes out his wallet, extracts the tattered calling card
that he found with SAL'S money and dials the number. He lets
it ring a long time but there is no answer.

EXT. DESERTED STREET WITH SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

NICK is not sure where he is. Suddenly he stops, recognizing
the yard with the little grape arbor where he met ARMAND.

EXT. YARD BEHIND SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

The yard is grown over. As NICK goes in there comes a low
buzz of flies. He trips over something, draws back. Seeing a
candle on the little table under the grape arbor, he crosses
and lights it.

The yard is full of discarded champagne bottles, red velvet
cushions and rotting CORPSES. NICK leans over one of the
CORPSES. The skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe
with maggots.

NICK straightens, looks around.

			NICK 
	Merle!!!

The back door to the building is open. NICK draws his pistol
and goes in.

INT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

NICK finds his way blocked by a door. He steps back, hurls
himself against it. The door gives way with a crash and he
staggers into the middle of a small stage hung with red
velvet curtains and furnished with a table and two chairs.

Out beyond the proscenium, huddled together in a litter of
broken cafe tables, a FAMILY OF REFUGEES stare at him in
terror from the other side of a small fire.

			NICK
		(waves pistol)
	It's okay.

The REFUGEES cower back even further.

			NICK (CONT'D)
		(screaming)
	It's okay, God damn it! It's all
	right!

POUNDING and BANGING come from the direction of the front
door. NICK crosses...

INT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

NICK readies his pistol, cautiously unbolts the door and
jerks it open. The COLONEL FROM THE AIRPLANE tumbles in and
falls flat on his back. Standing in the doorway, lit by the
headlights of two cars, is a party of U.S. OFFICERS, ARVN
OFFICERS and WHORES.

			COLONEL
		(no attempt to get up)
	Hey, good buddy, how you doin'?
		(gestures)
	This is Biederman, you guys.
	Biederman, this is Son Loc, Tu Fon,
	Huckerbelly and Potts. What's the
	story here, Biederman? We're
	looking for... Wait a minute.

He fishes a piece of paper out of his breast pocket.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	Here it is. Chez Armand.

			WHORE 
	Chez Armand not here! Chez Armand
	has gone to other spot!

			COLONEL 
		(gets up)
	Honey, c'mere. Come right here.

The COLONEL opens a brown paper bag he is carrying and
presents her with a large red, white and blue dildo.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	This is for bein' so smart.

The WHORE shrieks with pleasure. EVERYONE laughs.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
		(arm around WHORE)
	Let's go! Mount up! C'mon
	Biederman!

The COLONEL throws an arm around NICK and they all start for
the cars.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
		(to NICK)
	Boy, do I love this conflict.
	Huh?... What the hell were you
	doin' in there?

			NICK
	You know a guy named Merle?

			COLONEL 
	Merle? That's who we're looking
	for. Merle.

			NICK 
	Yeah?

			COLONEL 
	Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes
	says he goes one more... He
	retired, you know.

			NICK 
	Yeah?

			COLONEL 
	Now he's back.

Pulls NICK close so he can whisper in his ear.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	He eats 'em... Sure... He eats 'em
	raw!

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - SAIGON OUTSKIRTS NIGHT

An elegant house of French design is ablaze with lights. The
house is encircled by a stone terrace on which tables have
been set up. Over the terrace and strung out for a hundred
yards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns
which bob and sway in the wind. GUESTS are everywhere --
wandering in and out of the house, sitting at the tables and
strolling under the trees. For the most part the GUESTS are
AMERICANS and SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The majority of these are
OFFICERS IN UNIFORM, but there are numerous CIVILIANS mixed
among them and the CIVILIANS are attired in everything from
sports shirts to white linen suits and tuxedos. As to
nationality there are no limits. There are FRENCH, GERMANS,
BELGIANS, SWISS, CHINESE, BRITISH and AUSTRALIANS. WHORES and
MISTRESSES abound. WIVES are not greatly in evidence, except
to dog the heels of heavily armed ARVN GUARDS who wander
about, glass-eyed, drinking champagne.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - PARKING AREA - NIGHT

Jeeps, personnel carriers, trucks and light tanks are parked
side by side with gleaming Mercedes limousines, staff cars
from various government agencies and a blitz of civilian
vehicles running from sedans to motor scooters.

More vehicles arrive by the minute and exotic couples, like
plumed birds, debark in the swirling dust.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - CLEARING IN TREES - NIGHT

A dozen ARVN helicopters have put down between the trees. One
has crashed and lies on its side with a broken rotor.

There is a mounting clatter in the distance and another
helicopter comes out of the sky. As it sets down a dashingly
handsome AIR FORCE OFFICER hops out and extends a hand to his
WIFE. When his WIFE has descended the OFFICER opens a back
compartment in the fusilage and carefully takes out their
BABY. He hands the BABY to his WIFE and they stroll off
toward the house.

INT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT

Gambling tables are set up in all the rooms. The betting is
heavy, champagne flows like water and the atmosphere is one
of reckless abandon, as if money, like love, were good for an
hour.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE STAGE - NIGHT

Low bleachers covered in red velvet are set in a semi-circle
facing a small stage. The stage is lit with a single,
blindingly bright spotlight and is furnished with a table and
two velvet-covered chairs. Two CONTESTANTS, both of them
VIETNAMESE, sit opposite one another. Between them, lying on
the table, is a revolver. Both CONTESTANTS are dressed in
tuxedos. Both wear red numbers on their downstage arm.

Although the bleachers are not yet full, eager BETTORS jam
the first three rows. Here CLERKS with change trays take the
bets, signalling each transaction to a MARKER who chalks the
shifting odds on a large board.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, standing in the aisle, staring in
disbelief at the evolution of the game he once played.

Now a REFEREE enters the stage carrying two strips of scarlet
cloth.

			REFEREE
		(amplified)
	Game number seven. Gentlemen will
	please wrap.

The CONTESTANTS wrap their heads with the scarlet cloth.

			REFEREE (CONT'D)
		(as he loads revolver)
	One cartridge. Game to be played to
	completion. Forfeit automatic after
	delay of one minute.

The REFEREE places the pistol back in the center of the table
and spins a wheel whose -intervals are alternately marked L
and R. The wheel clatters to a stop with the marker on L.

			REFEREE 
	Gentleman on the left will now
	commence play.

The REFEREE steps out of the light. A gong sounds. The
CONTESTANT on the left picks up the pistol, spins the
cylinder, cocks it and

places it to his temple. He hesitates, pulls the trigger...
and clicks out.

NICK is unable to bear it. He turns, starts around toward the
back of the stage. AS NICK MOVES THROUGH THE GUESTS WE HEAR
THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER CLICKING, AMPLIFIED OVER A P.A.
SYSTEM. WE HEAR THE CLICK OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED...

NICK turns. The SECOND CONTESTANT has the pistol to his
temple. He pulls the trigger... THE GUN GOES OFF WITH A
DEAFENING ROAR and he topples on the floor.

The FIRST CONTESTANT STEPS FORWARD AS THE SPOTLIGHT NARROWS
TO CONTAIN HIM ALONE. HE BOWS, CLASPS HIS HANDS ABOVE HIS
HEAD AND DANCES AROUND.

NICK stares at the FIRST CONTESTANT celebrating his victory.
He looks around him. BETTORS are screaming and yelling in
five languages.

NICK starts off again, hurrying.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - BACKSTAGE AREA NIGHT

NICK comes upon a pile of six naked CORPSES with their heads
blown off. Opposite the CORPSES -- sitting, standing, pacing,
squatting in the dirt -- are a GROUP OF WAITING CONTESTANTS.
Some of these are AMERICAN. Most are SOUTH VIETNAMESE,
several of whom have come with WIVES and FAMILIES. A few of
the contestants are well dressed, most are in rags. THREE. OF
THE WAITING CONTESTANTS ARE WEARING TUXEDOS.

Suddenly a WOMAN WITH A BABY lets out a shriek. NICK spins.
TWO BURLY MEN appear, bringing the CORPSE OF THE SECOND
CONTESTANT. As the WOMAN WITH THE BABY begins sobbing and
screaming with grief the BURLY MEN strip the tuxedo off the
SECOND CONTESTANT and then, as each article is summarily
removed, they begin dressing one of the WAITING CONTESTANTS
in it.

			ARMAND (V.O.) 
	If you are brave and lucky I can
	make you rich.

NICK turns and finds ARMAND behind him. ARMAND studies him
for a fraction of a second and then smiles.

			ARMAND (CONT'D)
	C'est tres amusant... You have been
	promoted. And to a Jew... I am
	joking of course. Naturellement.
	Seriously, Nick, may I hope that
	you have come to play?

			NICK 
	I came to see Merle.

			ARMAND 
	Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			ARMAND 
		(studies him)
	You are his friend.

			NICK 
	Where is he???

			ARMAND 
		(faint smile)
	Merle is under his tree... Beside
	the terrace. You can't miss him.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TREES BY TERRACE - NIGHT

GUESTS are still coming in from the cars, strolling down
through the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering
like birds.

Laughter comes from the terrace. Glass tinkles and the tiny
lanterns bob and sway.

NICK appears, hurrying down the steps. Suddenly he stops.

MERLE is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. He is alone,
dressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving GUESTS with an
expression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops,
or snow flakes, or falling stones.

			NICK
		(shouts)
	Merle!

MERLE turns, watching NICK as he crosses toward him. When
NICK reaches the table, he stands.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?

			MERLE 
	Nick!... I thought you went home.

			NICK 
	I did. I... This is stolen. I came
	back.

			MERLE 
	Sit down.

NICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't
know where to start.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(breaking the silence)
	How's Linda?

			NICK 
	Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the
	hell are you doing?

			MERLE
		(eyes him)
	I like it, Nick.

			NICK
	Merle... Hey, Merle, listen... 
		(stares at him)
	Why?

For a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like
faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if
to some landscape far beyond.

			MERLE
	I like it because it's simple.

A BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL steps up and whispers something
in MERLE's ear.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(stands)
	I have to go, Nick. We'll have a
	drink.

MERLE and the VIETNAMESE GIRL move into the CROWD.

			NICK
	Merle...! Merle, wait!

NICK starts after them. He can see them ahead, moving rapidly
through a GROUP OF ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Merle!!!

NICK sees he can never overtake them directly. He cuts around
to the terrace.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT

NICK maneuvers his way down to the end of the terrace.

			NICK 
	Excuse me... Sorry... Sorry...
	Pardon.

NICK reaches the end of the terrace. MERLE and the BEAUTIFUL
VIETNAMESE GIRL have disappeared.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT

NICK sits at one of the tables. The terrace is deserted.

			REFEREE (V.O.)
	Gentleman on the right will now
	commence play.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT

The gaming tables are utterly deserted. AS NICK WANDERS
THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS THE SOUND OF THE GAME CONTINUES OVER
THE P.A. SYSTEM -- THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER SPINNING, THE
SOUND OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED... AND CLICK AFTER CLICK
INTO EMPTY CHAMBERS.

Suddenly NICK can stand it no more. He turns and starts
toward the entrance to the bleachers.

A SHOT EXPLODES OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM. NICK freezes, then he
runs.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE THEATRE - NIGHT

NICK appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers.
The CROWD is going wild, yelling and screaming. NICK pushes
through a group of BETTORS and then stops. A look of stunned
relief spreads over his features.

On the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight,
head bowed in acknowledgement of the OVATION.

NICK grins. He begins yelling and screaming along with
everyone else.

On the stage the tall figure raises his head, pumps his fists
in the air and begins hooting maniacally.

... WE NOW SEE, AS DOES NICK, THAT THE TALL FIGURE IN THE
SPOTLIGHT IS NOT MERLE AT ALL. IT IS MERLE'S OPPONENT.

INT. V.F.W. POST - BASEMENT - DAY

Pipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss of
leaking steam. Seated on a bench and all dressed-up in their
uniforms are FIVE OLD VETS. TWO VETS are on the nod. THE
OTHER THREE -- rheumy-eyed and ancient -- give patient
attention to the SIXTH VET who stands beside the boiler with
a bugle, trying to play TAPS.

			VET 1 
	Up a little there... What would you
	say?

			VET 2 
	Up.

The VET WITH THE BUGLE tries it again, flubs it, starts
over...

INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY

Three tables have been set up in the middle of the floor. The
tables have been laid with white cloth and the OLDER WOMEN
are setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a
funeral breakfast. They work in silence, fussing over the
placement of each knife and fork.

AS THE WOMEN WORK WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR SINGING AS
THE SERVICE PROGRESSES IN THE CHURCH. AT FIRST THE SOUND IS
BARELY AUDIBLE, EASILY MATCHED BY THE FAINT NOTES OF THE VET
WITH THE BUGLE IN THE BASEMENT BELOW.
BUT NOW THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR GROWS -- A SOUND AS DEEP AS
WATER, AS DARK AS NIGHT; A SOUND LIKE STONE.

Gradually, one by one, the OLDER WOMEN stop fussing with the
table. They stand motionless, listening.

EXT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - DAY

A HEARSE waits at the curb. The day is windless, cold and
grey Snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits a
ghostly cloud of white exhaust.

THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR IS MUCH LOUDER, ASCENDING IN DARK
TRIUMPH TO A SUDDEN, FINAL NOTE.

In the ringing silence of the MUSIC'S END the doors to the
church swing open. NICK, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN appear with
MERLE's flag-draped COFFIN. Followed by MOURNERS, they bear
the COFFIN slowly down the steps.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Snow drifts down from a leaden sky as the MOURNERS stand
together on a steep hillside of tilted, weather-worn
headstones. The mill looms behind them, breathing roiling
clouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks and
groans.

EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAY

The PRIEST completes his reading of the 23rd PSALM. The
MOURNERS join in the LORD'S PRAYER.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, VINCE, ALBERT, JOHN and SAL. They help
SAL to the side of the grave. It is awkward. The chair gets
stuck and they have to carry it. THEY ALL pick up a handful
of dirt and then, following NICK's lead, they throw it in.

NICK steps back from the grave, nods to the VETS. The VETS
come to attention. The VET WITH THE BUGLE steps forward and
tremblingly, but perfectly, PLAYS TAPS.

INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY

The meal is over. The WOMEN are drinking coffee, the MEN are
smoking and putting down the beer. There is muted laughter
and conversation.

NICK sits at the head of one of the tables, flanked by LINDA
and SAL. He looks stunned. His food is untouched, there are
tears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is.

			LINDA 
	Eat something, Nick. Eat a piece of
	toast.

NICK nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting all
about it, lays it absently on his plate.

VINCE comes up behind NICK, looking somewhat officious in a
new blue suit.

			VINCE 
	You want to say a few words, Nick?
	I think you should. Like that would
	wind things up.

NICK nods. VINCE raps on a glass.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright,
	everybody, Nick has a few words.

			NICK
		(very shaky)
	I just... would like to say a few
	words... about Merle. I guess Merle
	always wanted something... I don't
	know... better. That fucking guy,
	he saved my Life. He saved Sal's...
	What Merle liked, he liked things
	right... But then there wasn't any
	place for that... that he could
	find.

Tears are streaming down NICK's face and he sits down,
looking miserable.

			VINCE
		(hisses)
	John! Play something!

JOHN goes to the piano, hurried along by VINCE. He sits down,
casts a quick glance to the ceiling and begins playing
"America The Beautiful".

A FEW VOICES being SINGING. OTHERS join in. ALBERT stands up.
Then EVERYONE stands up.

                                     THE ELEPHANT MAN


              

               BLACK

               FADE IN: ABSTRACT DREAM

               CLOSE-UP of a gold framed miniature portrait of JOHN MERRICK'S 
               MOTHER (tune or melody over her picture, heartbeat), which 
               DISSOLVES TO CLOSE-UP of real Mother smiling A shadow comes 
               over her face. CLOSE-UP of elephant ears, trunks, faces 
               moving.

               Dark, heavy feet stomping elephant trumpet, rearing up.

               Powerful hit and the Mother falls. Darker. Trunk slides over 
               Mother's face and breasts and stomach, leaving a moist trail.

               MOTHER�S POV of elephant's mouth, eyes, skin. Mother's face 
               twists and freezes in a blurred snap roll.

               BLACK again. Knock, knock sound. Curtain opens to horrified 
               faces.

               CUT TO BLACK AND SILENCE

               CIRCUS

               FADE IN TO steam shooting out of a huge old half-rusted 
               calliope. The music is very loud and raucous. Moving up and 
               back we see the black awning entrance to the freak tent, 
               where FREDERICK TREVES, Resident Surgeon and Lecturer on 
               anatomy at the London Hospital, is standing with his back to 
               us observing the posters of the freaks.

               Coming along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is 
               Treves' wife, ANNE, and their two DAUGHTERS. The shrill over-
               whelming music seems to engulf her.

               She looks discomfited, vulnerable, and protective of her 
               daughters. The girls, oblivious to any fear, are finishing 
               their chocolate sweets.

               CLOSE-UP of Treves looking at a poster.

               He hears:

                                     #1 DAUGHTER
                         Poppa!

               Treves turns and looks down to a chocolate-covered face. He 
               smiles at the children and Anne.

               Anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them. 
               The other daughter looks into the freak tent.

                                     #2 DAUGHTER
                         Poppa... may we go in there?

                                     ANNE
                         Alright... Your turn.

               She turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins 
               cleaning her face.

               Her kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughter's face. 
               Suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the distance.

                                     #2 DAUGHTER
                         Oh,look M-ummy! Elephants!

                                     ANNE
                         Oh, elephants! We'll go see them.

               She stands.

                                     ANNE
                              (to Treves)
                         You won't be long?

                                     TREVES
                         I'll join you shortly.

               She takes the children off toward the elephants.

               Treves watches them go for a moment, then turns and we go 
               with him into the dark freak tent. He pauses to pay admission 
               at a small booth, then disappears within.

               DARKNESS. We hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant.

               Treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of 
               the tent. Off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black 
               cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully 
               into it. The tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. 
               People mill about through the weaving corridors. To Treves' 
               right, he sees a sign reading, "The Deadly Fruit of the 
               Original Sin," over a small, very dark corridor.

               Treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows.

               The corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient 
               the spectator.

               Treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the 
               inner chamber.

               In a roped-off space stands a small stage set at eve-level, 
               with curtains on three sides. On the stage is a bell jar 
               filled with grey-murky fluid lit from behind with casts an 
               eerie glow in the chamber. Suspended in the fluid is the 
               life-sized body of a baby-doll with the attached head of a 
               large snake. At the join of head and body is a blob of 
               unidentifiable organic matter. It is obviously phony, but 
               the effect is still very disquieting. At the bottom of the 
               jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of 
               it. Behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious 
               triptych, portraying Adam on one side, Eve on the other, and 
               the tree flowering over the jar.

               Treves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. He 
               studies the strange object with a critical eye. In the passage 
               we hear movement, and an OLDER GENTLEMAN enters. He seems 
               visibly impressed with "The Deadly Fruit of the Original 
               Sin."

                                     OLDER MAN
                         A wicked birth...

               After a moment, Treves quietly leaves the inner chamber.

               As he pushes his way through the corridor, the noise grows 
               and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds. He exits and hears 
               a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve 
               candles, mounted in a row on a ten-foot stand, are blown out 
               by "THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN." His BARKER steps up and talks 
               to the people.

                                     BARKER
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are 
                         larger than this mammoth blacksmith's 
                         bellows. So great is his power of 
                         exhalation, rivaling even that of 
                         the Great North Wind, that he will 
                         now challenge two grown men to attempt 
                         to hold the bellows shut as he applies 
                         the mighty blast of his herculean 
                         breath! Are there any volunteers?

               A few people raise their hands. The Barker scans the crowd 
               and then points over the heads of the volunteers to TWO MEN 
               toward the back.

                                     BARKER
                         Ah! I see two likely lads! Come 
                         forward! Come forward! Pit your 
                         strength against the Mighty Wind-
                         Man!

               During the above, The Incredible Wind-Man removes his cape, 
               revealing his great barrel chest and pot-belly supported by 
               spindly, white, hairless legs.

               As the Barker sets the "Volunteers," the Wind-Man walks about 
               the small platform, huffing and puffing and blowing on the 
               conch shell.

               The "Volunteers" set, the Wind-Man steps up to the end of 
               the bellows, takes an enormous breath, and twirls his black 
               handlebar moustache as a signal to the Barker.

                                     BARKER
                         Gentlemen... Are you ready?

                                     THE LADS
                         Yes we are... Right... etc.

                                     BARKER
                         Ladies and Gentlemen!... Let the 
                         demonstration begin!!

               The Wind-Man clamps his mouth to the bellows, and with great 
               show begins to exhale, savagely stamping his feet. The Two 
               Lads struggle obviously, and then pretend to be forced apart.

               The Barker triumphantly lifts the Wind-Man's hand. The Wind-
               Man ceases to blow, removes his lips from the bellows and 
               the Two Lads instantly collapse together on the floor.

                                     BARKER
                         Ladies and Gentlemen!... "THE 
                         INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN!!!

               The crowd cheers, while the Wind-Man puts the conch shell to 
               his lips and proudly stamps his feet, circling about the Two 
               Lads.

               Amidst this applause, Treves smiles indulgently. He moves 
               on, looking for something genuine.

               TWO BOBBIES move through the crowd, intent upon a certain 
               destination. Treves conveys a casual interest in them.

               Treves moves on to A BEARDED LADY who combs her beard, busily 
               chewing tobacco and spitting into a spittoon.

               Treves continues to work his way through the crowd. Up ahead 
               he sees the Bobbies.

                                     BOBBIES
                         Make way! Make way!

               They round a corner.

                                     WOMAN (V.O.)
                         Oh yes they are, they're yours 
                         alright.

               We hear the laughter of a crowd.

               Treves moves closer to see a FAT LADY seated in a chair on 
               the next platform.

               On each knee she holds a DWARF. They are dressed as babies. 
               A SKELETON MAN stands beside her.

                                     SKELETON MAN
                         I refuse to believe it! I will not 
                         accept it! Those babies are simply 
                         too ugly, they cannot be mine!

               The crowd laughs uproariously.

                                     SKELETON MAN
                         I don't want them! Get rid of them! 
                         I don't want to see them!

                                     FAT LADY
                         Darling, don't be difficult! Let's 
                         take our sweet lovely children on an 
                         outing.

                                     SKELETON MAN
                         We'll take these miserable whelps on 
                         an outing, alright! We'll take them 
                         to the zoo... WHERE THEY WILL STAY!

               From the direction the Bobbies have gone, we hear several 
               screams.

                                     FAT LADY
                              (pausing at the screams)
                         Children save yourselves! Prevail 
                         upon your Pappa!

               The two Dwarves get down from her knees and approach the 
               Skeleton Man. They kneel and tug at his thin legs.

                                     DWARVES
                         Poppa! Poppa! Poppa, please!

               At this point, a FATHER holding his YOUNG SON in his arms 
               passes by Treves.

               The Young Boy clutches his Father's neck in fear, hiding his 
               face.

                                     FATHER
                              (out loud, to no one 
                              in particular)
                         This is too much! They should not 
                         allow it! They should not allow it!

               Treves, very curious now, along with several others, make 
               their way around the corner.

               Before him, Treves sees an agitated crowd staring at something 
               that from his point of view he cannot see. Brushing past him 
               is a WOMAN pulling a small, confused and frightened LITTLE 
               GIRL. Getting closer to the commotion, he sees four BOBBIES 
               standing with a well-dressed alderman, arguing with the OWNER 
               of this particular exhibit.

               A distraught, almost hysterical WOMAN is ineffectually 
               striking the Owner with her fists about his head and 
               shoulders, crying weakly and incoherently.

                                     WOMAN
                         Beast, Beast...

               Treves is just about to see whatever it is that is causing 
               the alarm, when one of the Bobbies says:

                                     BOBBY
                         No! That's right out! Drop the 
                         curtain!

               As the curtain drops, Treves just glimpses baggy trouser 
               cuffs and two horribly deformed, root-like feet. The 
               distraught Woman has been pulled away from the Owner and is 
               sobbing on a Bobby's shoulder.

                                     OWNER
                         You can't do that! I've got my rights!

                                     ALDERMAN
                         I have the authority to close you 
                         down, and I'm doing just that!

               In the crowd, Treves notices a YOUNG BOY staring open-mouthed, 
               blankly at the curtain. Treves pushes through the glut of 
               people to join the Boy and get a better view. The curtain is 
               actually a large canvas.

               On it is a life-sized portrait, crudely painted, of a creature 
               that could only be possible in a nightmare. It is the figure 
               of a man turning into an elephant. The transformation, 
               however, is not complete; there is still more of the man 
               than beast. Palm trees in the background suggest the jungle 
               habitat in which this Perverted object might have once roamed.

               Filled with curiosity, Treves moves toward the curtain.

                                     ALDERMAN
                         This exhibit degrades all who see 
                         it, as well as the poor creature 
                         himself.

                                     OWNER
                         He's a freak! How else can he live?

                                     ALDERMAN
                         Freaks are one thing. No one objects 
                         to freaks, but this is entirely 
                         different. This is monstrous, and 
                         ought not to be allowed. These 
                         officers will see to it that you are 
                         on your way as soon as possible. 
                         Good day.

               The alderman turns and leaves the tent.

                                     OWNER
                              (to himself)
                         ...Movin' again!

               He shakes his head in disgust.

               Now at the canvas, Treves tries to lift the edge to get a 
               peek inside the wagon, but the meaty hand of the Owner clamps 
               down on his wrist.

                                     OWNER
                         Have a care, guv'nor.

               The two men look at each other for a solid moment.

                                     TREVES
                         Forgive me...

               Treves backs away and returns his gaze to the painted canvas.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               OPERATING ROOM - THE LONDON HOSPITAL

               We see a bellows pumping air into the open grate of a cast 
               iron stove. We hear moaning in the background. The coals 
               flare to a fierce glow. From the mouth of the stove protrude 
               the handles of several cauterizing irons, their heads imbedded 
               in the coals. Up above the irons, Treves stands by a waist-
               high operating table covered with black leather. His face is 
               illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse.

               The room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive overcast sky 
               seen through two windows. There is also a large sink, a 
               cupboard containing dressings, gags, manacles, emetics and 
               other unattractive things, and two hard chairs.

               TWO STUDENTS and two other DOCTORS, MR. FOX and MR. HILL, 
               are present. The two Students are pulling with constant 
               pressure on a rope tied to the patient's leg. Treves and Mr. 
               Fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine accident. 
               There are gear-wheel marks getting progressively deeper as 
               they near a great open gash. Mr. Hill places a cotton mask 
               over the patient's nose and mouth and applies drops of 
               chloroform. The patient struggles, but soon his moans subside 
               and he is unconscious.

                                     TREVES
                         How long has this man been here?

                                     FOX
                         Three quarters of an hour.

                                     TREVES
                         Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. 
                         Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope 
                         please. It's a machine accident. I 
                         expect you'll be seeing a good deal 
                         of this.

               The two medical Students come forward. They stare uneasily 
               at the gaping wound, which bubbles each time the man takes 
               an agonized breath.

               Treves and Fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as Hodges 
               and Pierce look on.

                                     TREVES
                              (off handedly)
                         Abominable things these machines. 
                         One can't reason with them.

                                     FOX
                         What a mess.

               Treves now notices that the student's faces have gone a trifle 
               ashen.

                                     TREVES
                         What got you into medicine, Hodges?

                                     HODGES
                         My father, sir. He's built quite a 
                         successful practice. I hope to take 
                         it over one day.

                                     TREVES
                         Is that your case as well, Pierce?

                                     PIERCE
                         Yes sir. Though of course I do have 
                         a great desire to help my fellowman.

               Treves smiles at them knowingly.

                                     TREVES
                         Of course you do realize that medicine 
                         has changed quite a bit since your 
                         father's time. In those days we didn't 
                         even wash our coats. In fact, the 
                         sign of a truly accomplished surgeon--
                         was his black operating coat, so 
                         stiff with dried blood and pus that 
                         it could stand up by itself in the 
                         corner. I've still got mine 
                         upstairs... You don't mind blood, do 
                         you?

                                     HODGES & PIERCE
                         Oh no, sir. (etc.)

                                     TREVES
                         Good, that's one thing we've always 
                         plenty of.

               HALLWAY

               A hospital MESSENGER BOY, dressed in a blue uniform and a 
               can is making his way down the hall. He stops and looks into 
               an operating room much like the one we have just seen.

               Inside, the room is empty. The Boy closes the door and 
               continues on to another operating room. The Doctors move 
               with great urgency around the operating table. Blood is 
               draining down into a white porcelain bowl. A Woman can be 
               heard moaning. The Boy looks carefully, but finally closes 
               the door and continues on his way.

               TREVES' OPERATING ROOM

               There is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing of 
               the wound comes up obscuring part of Treves' face. The patient 
               is being held down firmly by the other men.

               The door opens and Treves looks up. The Boy pops his head 
               in.

                                     BOY
                         Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes?

                                     BOY
                         I found it.

                                     TREVES
                              (studying the Boy 
                              carefully)
                         Did you see it?

               The Boy shakes his head slowly, "No."

                                     TREVES
                         I'll be with you in a moment ...

               The Boy closes the door.

                                     FOX
                              (quietly)
                         I say Freddie, what are you about?

                                     TREVES
                         Oh nothing... nothing of any great 
                         importance.

               AERIAL SHOT from third floor of the London Hospital looking 
               down on the hospital square.

               Below, Treves is walking briskly across the square, through 
               a gate and into the slums beyond.

               The aerial shot is actually FOX'S POV, and now we see Fox 
               filled with curiosity, watching the figure from a window.

               Looking down from above and to the side of him, we follow 
               Treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a 
               recent rain, covered with horse manure and filth of all sorts. 
               The air is smoky from meat burning fires.

               Rounding a corner, we see and approach the painted canvas 
               sign of "The Elephant Man" covering the front of a small, 
               dingy shop. The door of the shop is windowless and padlocked. 
               Treves walks into the picture, studies the whole scene for a 
               moment, goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked.

               Treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas. To his 
               left he sees a SMALL BOY watching him intently.

                                     TREVES
                         Do you know where the proprietor is?

               He holds a coin out. The Boy nods, snatches the coin and 
               then disappears around the corner.

               Treves turns back to the canvas.

               A PUB

               A noisy pub, long and narrow. Benches run the length of the 
               back wall, with small tables up against them. Men are 
               clustered around the bar, talking in groups.

               We see the Boy standing at one of the tables talking to the 
               Owner, greedily consuming his lunch as he listens. The Boy 
               gestures outside.

               OUTSIDE THE PUB

               The Boy comes out the door, quickly followed by the Owner 
               hurriedly putting on his coat, fumbling with a riding crop, 
               the last of his sandwich stuffed in his mouth.

               AT THE CORNER

               The Boy and the Owner are carefully looking around the corner 
               at Treves still in front of the portrait.

                                     OWNER
                         He's not a peeler...

                                     BOY
                         No, I don't think so.

                                     OWNER
                         No... I don't think so.

               They walk into the street.

               IN FRONT OF THE SHOP

               The Owner and the Boy walk up to Treves.

                                     TREVES
                         Are you the proprietor?

                                     OWNER
                         And who might you be, sir?

                                     TREVES
                         Just one of the curious. I'd like to 
                         see it.

                                     OWNER
                         I don't think so. No sir, we're 
                         closed.

               Treves pulls a purse from his coat, extracts a coin and holds 
               it out.

                                     TREVES
                         I'd pay handsomely for a private 
                         showing. Are you the proprietor?

                                     OWNER
                         Handsomely?... Who sent you?

                                     TREVES
                         Pardon me?

                                     OWNER
                         Never mind. I'm the owner.

               He snatches the money.

               INSIDE THE SHOP

               Total darkness. We hear the sound of the padlock being 
               removed. The door opens and light streams in. The canvas 
               covering the windows at the front of the shop obscures all 
               other light. The Owner enters, followed by Treves and the 
               Boy. From his expression, as well as Treves', we can tell 
               there must be an awful stench in the room. No one says a 
               word. The Boy closes the door, while the owner lights a small 
               gas light. We can now see the shop. It it empty, grey with 
               dust, cold and dank. Some old tins and a few shriveled 
               potatoes occupy a shelf. The far end of the shop is blocked 
               off by a curtain suspended from a cord by a few rings.

               The Owner approaches it.

                                     OWNER
                         Here we are sir.
                              (ticking it off by 
                              rote)
                         Life is full of surprises. Ladies 
                         and gentlemen, consider the fate of 
                         this creature's poor mother. In the 
                         fourth month of her maternal 
                         condition, she was struck down by a 
                         wild elephant
                              (leering)
                         Struck down, if you take my meaning, 
                         on an uncharted African isle. The 
                         result is plain to see ladies and 
                         gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT 
                         MAN!

               The rings rattle back, and the curtain is omen. We see a 
               bent figure crouching on a stool, covered by a brown blanket. 
               In front of it on a tripod is a large brick, heated from 
               below by a bunsen burner. From the blanket protrudes a 
               perfectly normal left arm and hand warming itself over the 
               brick.

               It does not move when the curtain is drawn.

               Treves steps closer. The Owner, watching his every move, 
               turns-and smiles at him. He bangs his riding crop on the 
               wall and yells to the crouched figure, as if speaking to a 
               dog.

                                     OWNER
                         Stand up!

               The Boy, excited by his own fear, mimics the Owner.

                                     BOY
                         Stand up!

               The figure comes forward and lets the blanket fall to the 
               ground and we see the ELEPHANT MAN himself.

               Treves, his eyes wide with horror and wonder, his mouth frozen 
               open, steps backward in an instinctive movement of self 
               preservation.

               The Owner laughs.

               The Elephant Man is naked to the waist, his feet are bare 
               and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat man's dress 
               suit. He is a little below average height, and looks shorter 
               from the bowing of his back. His head is enormous and 
               misshapen, as big around as a man's waist. From his brow 
               projects a huge boney mass, almost obscuring his right eye. 
               His nose is a nose of flesh, recognizable only from its 
               position.

               From the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding 
               from the mouth like a stump, turning the upper lip inside 
               out, making a slobbering aperture.

               It almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or 
               tusk. On top of his head is a handful of lank, black hair. 
               At the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin, resembling 
               cauliflower. These loathsome growths cover his back and hang 
               down to the middle of his thighs. The right arm is enormous 
               and shapeless, the hand like a knot of tuberous roots. His 
               left arm is not only normal, but delicately shaped, with 
               fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy. From his 
               chest hangs another bag of flesh, like the dewlap of a lizard.

               His legs are also grossly deformed, his feet great stumps. 
               Behind him, as painted in the portrait, are two crudely 
               constructed palm trees.

               The Owner harshly raps again.

                                     OWNER
                         Turn around!

               The Elephant Man begins to turn. The boy filled with malicious 
               glee at seeing the monster obey, screams.

                                     BOY
                         Turn around! Turn around!

               The Elephant Man completes his turn and comes to rest.

               We see a CLOSE-UP of the Elephant Man looking at Treves. His 
               face is utterly devoid, and incapable, of expression.

               We see the Elephant Man's eyes. He closes them.

               OUTSIDE THE SHOP

               The Owner is locking up.

               Treves, facing the street, drinks in the fresh air. He is 
               trying to forget his shock, put everything into focus.

               He looks at the garish portrait again.

               Treves produces his purse.

               The Owner, smelling money, turns.

               Treves hands him several coins.

                                     TREVES
                         So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 
                         10:00 a.m.? Mr...?

                                     OWNER
                         Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.

                                     TREVES
                         I'll send a cab. Here is my card.

               Treves hands the Owner a card. The Owner, greasy and dirty, 
               shakes Treves' hand and squeezes his arm.

                                     OWNER
                         Now we got a deal... We understand 
                         each other... guv. We understand 
                         each other completely.

               The Owner gives Treves the evil look of a conspirator.

               Treves walks off, disoriented.

               The Owner reads the card and smiles at Treves walking away 
               down the street.

               DISSOLVE TO OUTSIDE THE SHOP

               A CABMAN is knocking on the door of the shop, staring at the 
               portrait. The door opens, revealing a figure in a floor-length 
               black cloak. On his head is an extremely large hat, cut to 
               the lines of a yachting cap. A grey-flannel curtain hangs 
               from the bottom of the cap all the way around, hiding his 
               face.

               There is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes. On the 
               figure's feet are large, bag-like slippers. The only part of 
               the body seen at all is the left arm and hand, which protrudes 
               from the cloak, holding a crude walking stick.

               The figure seems to loathe being in the open. We can just 
               barely see in the darkness within the Owner standing to one 
               side of the door, obviously enjoying the surprise on the 
               Cabman's face. The Owner steps abruptly into his view.

                                     OWNER
                         Don't just stand there. Help him up.

               The Cabman, does so, while a small, curious crowd forms. The 
               Owner gives the Cabman the card. The Cabman jumps up onto 
               the seat and off they go.

               THE RECEIVING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL

               The receiving room is a bare hall, painted stone color. It 
               has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are made, 
               and certificates and other papers are issued. It is a cold, 
               harsh place.

                                     CABMAN
                         Not at all, sir. My... pleasure.

               He exits.

               Treves turns and sees the Matron, staring.

                                     TREVES
                         I'll be in my rooms, Mothershead. 
                         I'm not to be disturbed.

               She nods silently. Treves looks at the figure for a moment.

                                     TREVES
                         Come with me, please.

               He starts to go out of the room. The hooded figure just stands 
               there, motionless.

               We see the whole room, the people now silent. They all stare 
               at the figure.

               No one makes a move.

                                     MATRON
                         You heard the doctor... Go on.

               Treves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands there a 
               moment, then slowly shuffles after him. Mrs. Mothershead and 
               the people in the room watch him go. When he is out of sight, 
               they all begin to talk excitedly.

               Mothershead stands fixed and watches too, ignoring the noisy 
               room.

               TREVES' OFFICE

               The door opens and Treves leads the hooded figure to a chair 
               in front of his desk and helps him to sit down, furtively 
               trying to look into the eye-slit of the mask. In the small 
               room the smell of the Elephant Man is overwhelming.

               Treves goes to the window and opens it. He nervously tries 
               to compose himself, then turns to the hooded figure.

                                     TREVES
                         My name is Frederick Treves... I am 
                         a surgeon here at the London Hospital, 
                         and I lecture in anatomy at the 
                         Medical College... I would very much 
                         like to examine you. Would that be 
                         all right?

               The figure in the chair is still. Treves is at a loss. His 
               sense of discomfort is growing. He looks at the floor for a 
               moment, then locks his eyes on the figure's left arm.

                                     TREVES
                         Ah... yes. Um, first I would like to 
                         ask you a few questions, would that 
                         be all right?

               The figure does nothing. Treves sits down at his desk and 
               picks up a pencil.

                                     TREVES
                         Good. Now, let's see. Your Owner... 
                         um, the man who... who looks after 
                         you tells me that you are English 
                         and your name is John Merrick. Is 
                         that correct?

               The figure does nothing.

                                     TREVES
                         Do you know where you were born? 
                         Where you come from?

               The figure does nothing.

                                     TREVES
                         I tell you what, I'll ask you a 
                         question, and you shake your head 
                         like this for "no" and nod like this 
                         for "yes", alright? Do you understand?

               The figure following Treves' movements nods very slowly, 
               "yes". Treves sighs with relief.

                                     TREVES
                         Are you in any pain?

               The figure begins to babble incoherently. Treves, alarmed, 
               interrupts.

                                     TREVES
                         Um, no. Just nod your head like this 
                         for "yes" and shake it like this for 
                         "no". Now, are you in any pain?

               Again the figure, following Treves movements, shakes his 
               head "no".

                                     TREVES
                         Are your parents still alive?

               The figure does nothing. Treves is quite nervous.

                                     TREVES
                         Do you understand? Are they dead? 
                         Your father... your mother?

               The figure begins to moan. There are two sharp raps at the 
               door. The hooded figure flinches.

               The door opens and Fox pokes his head into the room.

                                     FOX
                         Freddie, what you doing for... I say 
                         do open a window in here or...

               He notices the hooded figure.

                                     FOX
                         Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, I had no 
                         idea that... I say!

               Treves quickly rises and pushes Fox out into the hallway, 
               following him and closing the door.

               IN THE HALLWAY

               Treves and Fox are standing outside the door to Treves' 
               office.

                                     FOX
                         Good Lord, Freddie! What have you 
                         got in there?

                                     TREVES
                         You'll know presently. At the meeting 
                         of the society. But until then, I 
                         beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.

                                     FOX
                         Certainly, if you insist. You must 
                         have quite a find there.

                                     TREVES
                         I don't know what I've got.

                                     FOX
                         Nothing of any importance, eh?

               Treves turns to go back in, then stops.

                                     TREVES
                         I'll tell you this much, Fox, it's 
                         beyond anything you or I have ever 
                         dealt with. Keep it to yourself, 
                         please.

               He goes back in, shutting the door.

               TREVES' OFFICE

               Treves turns the key in the door. He turns to the chair the 
               figure had been occupying, but he is not there.

               The figure is hiding in the corner, crouched behind a black 
               frock operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus it 
               stands up by itself.

               Treves looks quickly around the room and finally sees him. 
               He looks at the figure for a moment.

                                     TREVES
                         Come sit down.

               The frightened figure just crouches there looking at him. 
               Treves goes to him, pulls him up and over to the chair.

                                     TREVES
                         Sit... down.

               The figure sits. Treves pauses uncertainly.

                                     TREVES
                         I think I'll examine you now. I'll 
                         save the questions for later... Will 
                         you take off your hat now, please?

               The figure does nothing. Treves moves to him.

                                     TREVES
                         Don't be frightened, I simply want 
                         to look at you. Do you understand?

               The figure leans back fearfully. From behind him we see just 
               the top of his wide hooded head.

               Treves, standing before him, lifts the hood up and back.

                                     TREVES
                              (more to himself)
                         That's right, don't be frightened. 
                         Don't be frightened.

               SMALL ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL

               We see two cameras set up, their OPERATORS next to them 
               staring at something we cannot see. Treves stands beside 
               them concentrating on the same sight.

               All three are speechless.

               Treves suddenly remembers himself.

                                     TREVES
                         Are you ready?

               The Cameramen mumble, "Yes", and gratefully disappear beneath 
               the black cloths of their cameras.

                                     TREVES
                         Go ahead.

               They trigger the flash powder. In the blinding flashes we 
               briefly see the silhouette of a tremendously bulky figure, 
               starting at the light.

               DISSOLVE TO LECTURE HALL - PATHOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON

               BRIGHT LIGHT

               As we pull back and down in a slow spiral we see the light 
               is coming through high windows. We now see several rows of 
               distinguished doctors talking to each other in anticipation. 
               As we continue to spiral down we see Treves before them at a 
               podium. Behind him are two ASSISTANTS standing beside a 
               curtained stall. Treves raps a pointer stick on the podium 
               to bring the meeting to order. We move behind the stall as 
               the Assistants part the curtains and we see the silhouette 
               of the Elephant Man. The doctors talk among themselves 
               quietly.

                                     TREVES
                         He is English, he is twenty-one years 
                         of age and his name is John Merrick. 
                         Gentlemen, in the course of my 
                         profession I have come upon lamentable 
                         deformities of the face due to injury 
                         or disease, as well as mutilations 
                         and contortions of the body, depending 
                         upon like causes; but, at no time 
                         have I met with such a dreaded or 
                         perverted version of a human being 
                         as this man. I wish to draw your 
                         attention to the insidious conditions 
                         affecting this patient. Note, if you 
                         will, the extreme enlargement of the 
                         skull... and upper limb, which is 
                         totally useless. The alarming 
                         curvature of the spine... Turn him, 
                         please... the looseness of the skin, 
                         and the varying fibrous tumors that 
                         cover 90% of the body.

               Treves' voice fades as we DISSOLVE TO the Doctors, who at 
               first were rigid and flustered, and now bent forward, 
               concentrating, obviously consumed with interest.

               Spiraling down again we see Treves finishing his lecture.

                                     TREVES
                         ...And there is every indication 
                         that these afflictions have been in 
                         existence, and have progressed 
                         rapidly, since birth. The Patient 
                         also suffers from chronic bronchitis. 
                         As an interesting side-note, in spite 
                         of the afore-mentioned anomalies, 
                         the patient's genitals remain entirely 
                         intact and unaffected.

               Treves nods to the Assistants and they go to the Elephant 
               Man. We see them in shadow untying the loose knot of the 
               loin cloth.

               CLOSE-UP of the shadow of the head of the Elephant Man. It 
               goes up for a breath.

                                     TREVES
                         So then, gentlemen, owing to this 
                         series of deformities: The congenital 
                         exostoses of the skull; extensive 
                         papillomatous growths and large 
                         pendulous masses in connection with 
                         the skin; the great enlargement of 
                         the right upper limb, involving all 
                         the bones; the massive distortion of 
                         the head and the extensive areas 
                         covered by papillomatous growth, the 
                         patient has been called, "The Elephant 
                         Man."

               TREVES OFFICE

               The Elephant Man (hereafter the E.M.) wearing his cloak, is 
               seated by the desk. Treves stands behind him, measuring his 
               head with calipers. He removes the calipers and notes the 
               span, then sets them on the desk. He places the hood over 
               the E.M.'s head. Treves sits at his desk and makes some final 
               notes. He becomes more absorbed in his notes than in the 
               E.M. The E.M. makes an unintelligible sound.

                                     TREVES
                         Hmm?

               The E.M. is silent. Treves, only now realizing that the E.M. 
               has said something, looks up at him.

                                     TREVES
                         Hmm?

               The E.M. is silent. Treves passes it off as a sigh and turns 
               back to his work.

                                     TREVES
                         It's been a long day for everyone.

               He closes his notebook and rises. He remembers something.

                                     TREVES
                         Oh, yes, you'll need a cab...
                              (to the E.M.)
                         Stay.

               He exits. The E.M. is alone. He rises and shuffles slowly 
               about, investigating the room. He goes to the desk and begins 
               touching things, including the calipers. He notices the card 
               Treves gave to the Owner tucked in the back pages. He pauses 
               for a moment and then takes the card. His hand disappears 
               into the cloak, and he moves back into the corner behind the 
               stiff, black operating coat.

               Treves re-enters.

                         Come with me.

               The E.M. takes up his stick and follows Treves out.

               UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THE LONDON HOSPITAL

               We see Treves and Fox alone at a window. They are looking 
               down on the hospital square Treves had previously crossed 
               and see the E.M., lit by gaslight and moving to a waiting 
               cab.

                                     FOX
                         You never mentioned his mental state.

                                     TREVES
                         He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. 
                         He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. 
                         No, the man's a homeless idiot...
                              (to himself)
                         I pray God he's an idiot.

               The E.M., as he is getting into the cab, stops, turns and 
               looks to the upper stories of the hospital. Treves and Fox 
               are joined by three laughing colleagues who clap Treves on 
               the back.

                                     THE FIRST
                         Quite a coup, Freddie. You'll look 
                         splendid in the journal.

                                     THE SECOND
                         Where ever did you find that creature?

               From the upper story we watch the cab drive away.

                                     THE THIRD (V.O.)
                         It's a pity.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         I pity the poor cab driver, myself.

               From outside the window we see Treves surrounded by his 
               laughing friends.

               ENTRY HALL - TREVES' HOME

               We see a door. It opens and Treves walks in. He shuts the 
               door, locks it, goes to a coat rack on the wall and hangs up 
               his overcoat and hat. He notices his reflection in a mirror 
               and examines himself wearily. Anne's smiling reflection 
               appears beside his.

                                     ANNE
                         Did it go well, darling?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, very well, I think. Are the 
                         girls in bed?

                                     ANNE
                         Yes, and they send their kisses. 
                         Would you like your sherry now?

                                     TREVES
                         No, I think a whiskey.

               We move past Anne's reflection to a CU of Treves.

               WHITECHAPEL - NIGHT

               We now see a bunsen burner roar of flame reflected in Bytes' 
               eyes. Pulling back we see Bytes, quite drunk, sitting, cooking 
               sausages over the hot brick.

               He takes another drink from his gin bottle. Up comes a wet 
               belch and he takes another drink.

               The E.M. is crouched against the wall with a bowl of potatoes 
               and a cup of water in front of him. With his good hand, he 
               is picking tiny pieces of potato and feeding himself. The 
               eating is fairly loud and animal-like. The drinking is even 
               worse.

               The Boy is across the room asleep, wrapped in ragged little 
               blankets.

               The E.M. takes a drink of water, making a loud smacking, 
               slurping sound.

               Bytes looks up from his cooking with a smoldering look, just 
               waiting for him to make the sound again. He does and Bytes 
               takes his crop and violently jabs him.

                                     BYTES
                         Belt up, you misbegotten garbage.
                              (mumbling to himself)
                         How can I eat with that?

               Bytes takes a mouthful of gin and mockingly slurps it 
               mimicking the E.M.'s sound.

                                     BYTES
                              (yelling)
                         How can I eat with THAT?

               The E.M. picks and eats some more and then drinks again very 
               tentatively.

               Because of his fear the water catches in his throat and he 
               spits and coughs out onto the floor, gasping and wheezing 
               for breath.

               Bytes is up and whacks him with his riding crop.

                                     BYTES
                         Out of my sight!

               The E.M. struggles to get up, carrying his food.

                                     BYTES
                              (not satisfied with 
                              his speed)
                         NOW!

               He jabs the E.M. again, spilling his potatoes and water onto 
               the floor.

                                     BYTES
                         You clumsy sod!

               He pushes the E.M. again, then slips on the potatoes and 
               falls heavily to the floor, crying out in shock. Then rage 
               hits him. The E.M. backs up.

                                     BYTES
                         YOU!

               The Boy wakes up in fear. Bytes moves quickly toward the 
               E.M. raising his crop. The E.M. stumbles and falls backward 
               onto the floor. His head goes back and he begins gasping for 
               air. Bytes yanks him up and hits him in the face with his 
               riding crop. The force of the blow knocks a glob of spit 
               into the air from the E.M.'s mouth. The E.M. gasps and wheezes 
               horribly as Bytes hits him again and again.

               From across the room.

                                     BOY
                         Bytes! DON'T...

               Bytes goes right on with the beating.

                                     BYTES
                         This won't do, my lad. This just 
                         won't do!

               RECEIVING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL

               We see the eyes of the Boy. As we pull back from them, they 
               widen with recognition.

               WIDE SHOT of the Receiving Room. Treves has entered and the 
               Boy walks quickly up to him.

                                     BOY
                         Our man is sick. Come right away.

                                     TREVES
                         What is it?

                                     BOY
                         Like this.
                              (he breathes heavily 
                              in and out to 
                              demonstrate the E.M.'s 
                              difficulty)

                                     TREVES
                         I'll get my bag.

               INSIDE THE SHOP

               We hear the sound of wheezing coming from the E.M. who is 
               sitting propped up against the stage, wrapped in a blanket. 
               His head bent forward toward his knees. Bytes is going to 
               the door as it opens and the Boy leads Treves in.

               Treves immediately goes to the E.M.

                                     BYTES
                         What did you do to him? He's been 
                         like this all night!

                                     TREVES
                         What do you mean?

                                     BYTES
                         He was fine when he left here, and 
                         now look at him.

                                     TREVES
                         I intend to.

               Treves pulls the blanket away from the E.M. exposing several 
               bruises and bloody cuts. Treves freezes at the sight and 
               slowly turns to look at Bytes.

                                     TREVES
                         What happened?

                                     BYTES
                         He fell.
                              (guardedly)
                         He falls.

                                     TREVES
                         He must have taken quite a fall.

               He looks up at the riding crop in the hand of Bytes, then to 
               the strangely nervous and silent Boy.

                                     BYTES
                         He's a clumsy git. Never watches 
                         where he is going.

                                     TREVES
                         Why is he sitting up like this? He 
                         needs rest.

                                     BYTES
                         That's the way he sleeps. If he lays 
                         down, he'll die.
                              (he points to his 
                              neck and leans his 
                              head back)
                         Head's too heavy.

               Treves turns his attention to the E.M. He lifts his head 
               higher and examines the E.M.'s eyes. The E.M., who had been 
               oblivious up until this point, looks into Treves' eyes and 
               recognizes him. With his good hand, he reaches up and touches 
               Treves' arm almost as if appealing to him. Treves' eyes lock 
               on his.

                                     TREVES
                         This man belongs in hospital.

                                     BYTES
                              (apprehensively)
                         Can't you fix him up here? ...He's 
                         my livelihood. Listen.

                                     TREVES
                         You listen, you're not going to have 
                         much of a livelihood if this man 
                         dies. He's got the rale, he's very 
                         weak, and I don't know how much damage 
                         has been done by his "fall". Now 
                         stop wasting time and fetch a cab.

               Bytes considers and then snaps his fingers at the Boy who 
               runs out. He then breaks into an ingratiating grin and leans 
               down over Treves who busily examines the wheezing E.M.

                                     BYTES
                         I really appreciate this, guv. You 
                         know, there's lot of things that I 
                         can do for you. I move in the proper 
                         circles, for this type of thing...
                              (motioning toward the 
                              E.M.)
                         In fact, anything at all, if you 
                         take my meaning.

               Treves, uncomfortable, rises. Bytes grips his hand and with 
               the other gathers the material of his sleeve in a slow 
               deliberate squeeze.

                                     BYTES
                         I like doing business with you. You 
                         and I understand each other, 
                         completely. I know I can trust you. 
                         Can't I?

                                     TREVES
                              (gazing at him levelly)
                         Everything will be seen to.

               MORNING - AERIAL SHOT LOOKING DOWN ON HOSPITAL SQUARE

               Through a window we see Treves and the E.M. walking through 
               a back gate and across the square. MR. CARR GOMM, Hospital 
               Chairman, turns and moves away from the window.

               HALLWAY

               NURSE NORA IRELAND is pushing a cart filled of empty breakfast 
               trays down the hall. She glances into the stairwell and sees 
               Treves and the E.M. coming through the door. She continues 
               on, startled by the sight of the mysterious hooded figure. 
               At the end of the hall, she goes into the kitchen.

               STAIRWAY

               Treves and the E.M. are laboriously climbing a flight of 
               stairs. The E.M. is puffing and wheezing with the effort. 
               Treves supports him under his right arm.

               KITCHEN

               Nora enters with the cart and waits for it to be restocked. 
               She leans out the door for another look, but the hall is 
               empty. A Nurse ladles mush into bowls.

               There is a lot of activity in the kitchen. Nora takes the 
               cart stacked with full trays and pushes it out the door and 
               down the hallway.

               HALLWAY

               Treves and the E.M. cross the hallway and head up a narrow 
               stairway towards the attic. There is a sign reading 
               "Isolation".

               Carr Gomm is leaning out the door to his office, unseen by 
               Treves. He closes the door.

               GENERAL WARD - LONDON HOSPITAL - MORNING

               It is a long, high ceilinged room with large windows along 
               one wall. Beds run the length of both sides of the room. It 
               is a woman's ward and nurses are serving the patients 
               breakfast. Nora enters and nurses take trays from her cart. 
               Nora's mind is on what she has just seen. We see Mothershead 
               come in the door behind her.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                              (startling Nora)
                         Nora! Mind your duties... if you 
                         don't concentrate dear, you'll only 
                         make more work for the rest of us. 
                         Now, get about your business.
                              (pauses, seeing Nora's 
                              collar)
                         ...and do get your collar straight, 
                         dear.

                                     NORA
                              (fumbling with her 
                              collar)
                         I'm so sorry, Mrs. Mothershead.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Do get on with it, Nora.

               Mothershead walks on, as Nora now very flustered, picks up a 
               tray.

               ISOLATION WARD

               CU of a bottle of dark fluid and a bottle of light fluid. 
               Treves mixes the two in a glass. We are in a small oddly 
               shaped room off the attic ward.

               There is one tiny barred window located high up on the far 
               wall. There is also a bed, two hard chairs and a table. The 
               E.M. is sitting on the bed in shadow and his disguise is now 
               hanging from a peg on the wall beside him. He is still 
               wheezing and appears to be very weak. Treves serves the 
               mixture to the E.M., who sputters and gags on it, but manages 
               to get it down. Treves goes to the table and puts the two 
               bottles in his bag. He goes to the door and turns to the 
               E.M.

                                     TREVES
                         I don't know if you will understand 
                         this, but you will never go back to 
                         that man again. You're safe now. No 
                         one will ever harm you. Do you 
                         understand?

               The two men just look at each other.

               KITCHEN - LONDON HOSPITAL

               Treves enters the kitchen and nicks up a bowl. A NURSE ladles 
               some porridge for him.

                                     NURSE
                         Breakfasting with the patients this 
                         morning, Mr. Treves?

                                     TREVES
                         It's for a patient.

               Treves exits and the nurses admiringly watch him go.

               FIRST FLOOR LANDING AND HALLWAY

               Treves climbs the stairs onto the landing. Down the hall, 
               Mr. Carr Gomm is walking toward his office. Treves tries not 
               to be seen, but to no avail.

                                     CARR
                         Mr. Treves, come over here a moment, 
                         won't you?

               Treves hesitates, trying to hide the bowl, but gives up and 
               goes down the hall to meet Carr Gomm.

                                     CARR
                         Good morning, Treves.

                                     TREVES
                         Good morning, sir.

                                     CARR
                              (seeing the bowl)
                         You've acquired a taste for this?

                                     TREVES
                         It's quite nutritious, sir.

                                     CARR
                         Don't be mad. This muck can kill 
                         you.

               Carr Gomm calls a Nurse from a nearby ward over. It is Nora. 
               He takes the bowl from Treves and hands it to her.

                                     CARR
                         Take this up, to to the man in the 
                         isolation ward when you have a moment, 
                         won't you?

                                     NORA
                              (apprehensively)
                         Yes, sir.

                                     TREVES
                         Don't be frightened. He won't hurt 
                         you.

                                     CARR
                         Indeed!

               He gestures toward his office door. As he and Treves enter 
               the office, Nora looks apprehensively up the isolation ward 
               stairs.

               MR. CARR GOMM'S OFFICE

               It is a small, elegantly furnished room with a large window. 
               The two men sit, Carr Gomm behind his desk and Treves in a 
               leather chair.

                                     CARR
                         A hospital is no place for secrecy, 
                         Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded 
                         figures about are liable to cause 
                         comment. Why wasn't this patient 
                         properly admitted, and why is he in 
                         isolation? Is he contagious?

                                     TREVES
                         No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's 
                         been badly beaten.

                                     CARR
                         Why isn't he in the General Ward, 
                         then?

                                     TREVES
                         Well sir, he's quite seriously 
                         deformed, and I fear the other 
                         patients would find him... rather 
                         shocking.

                                     CARR
                         Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to 
                         assume that he is ultimately 
                         incurable?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes sir.

                                     CARR
                         What are your plans then, Treves... 
                         You are aware that the London does 
                         not accept incurables. The rules are 
                         quite clear on that point.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, I'm well aware of that. But 
                         this case is quite exceptional.

                                     CARR
                         Oh, is he a friend of yours?

                                     TREVES
                         No, more of an acquaintance.

               ISOLATION WARD (A) AND STAIRWAY (B) CARR GOMM'S OFFICE (C)

               (A) The E.M. is asleep in his sleeping posture on the bed.

               (B) Nora, with the bowl, is climbing the stairs to the attic 
               ward. She pauses in sight of the door and looks apprehensively 
               at it. She begins to hum to give herself courage, and 
               continues up the stairs.

               (A) The E.M. awakens, hears the footsteps, and now the 
               humming, which grows in volume. He becomes fearful and reaches 
               for his cloak. The humming stops. He freezes and listens.

               (C) Treves and Carr Gomm seated as before.

                                     CARR
                         I certainly sympathize with your 
                         problem, Treves... Why don't you try 
                         the British Home, or the Royal 
                         Hospital for perhaps they would have 
                         a place for him.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes sir, I'll look into that.
                              (he rises)
                         Would you like to meet him sir?

               (B) Nora stands outside the door, listening. She is barely 
               breathing.

               (A) The E.M., still listening, slowly lets his hand drop 
               away from the cloak.

               (B) Nora opens the door.

               (A) The E.M. grabs for the cloak as the door swings open 
               flooding him with light. We see him for the first time in 
               his entirety. CU of Nora screaming and dropping the tray. CU 
               of the caught E.M.

               (C) The shrill scream is heard from upstairs.

                                     TREVES
                         Excuse me, sir.

               Treves rushes out. Carr Gomm just sits for a moment, thinking.

                                     CARR
                         The Elephant Man?

               ISOLATION WARD LANDING

               Treves, rushing up the stairs, reaches the landing. Nora is 
               at the railing, crying. The door is open, the breakfast tray 
               littering the floor. The E.M. is on the bed trying to squeeze 
               into the corner. Treves quickly closes the door and tries to 
               comfort Nora.

                                     TREVES
                         I'm sorry, my dear, I should have 
                         warned you. I'm so terribly sorry, 
                         please forgive me. There, you're 
                         alright now. Go downstairs and please 
                         ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up. 
                         Tell her to knock on the door and 
                         wait for me. Alright?

                                     NORA
                         Yes Sir. I'm sorry, Sir.

               Drying her eyes, she goes downstairs.

               ISOLATION WARD

               Closing the door, Treves steps over the spilt breakfast and 
               goes to the E.M.

                                     TREVES
                         I'm very sorry about that. Are you 
                         resting well?

               The E.M. makes a garbled sound.

               Treves, alone with the E.M., once more finds himself becoming 
               uncomfortable.

                                     TREVES
                         Ah good. Well then... oh yes, we'll 
                         have to get you some more food. I'm 
                         sure you must be simply famished. 
                         Hmm?

               The E.M. is silent.

                                     TREVES
                         Of course you are. Now then, I think 
                         you'll be quite comfortable up here 
                         for awhile. I'll see to it you have 
                         everything you need, and, uh... yes.

               Treves puts out a comforting hand to the E.M. who flinches 
               back. The two men just look at each other.

               GENERAL WARD

               Several Nurses are taking bath things off a cart. At the 
               other end of the room, Mothershead is talking to a patient. 
               Nora enters and walks over to Mothershead. They talk, and 
               Mothershead exits. Nora joins the other nurses.

                                     OTHER NURSES
                         Did you see him?

                                     NORA
                         Yes.

                                     OTHER NURSES
                         What's wrong with him?

               We see Nora's face. She is silent.

               ISOLATION WARD LANDING

               Mothershead knocks on the door. Treves opens it, comes out 
               onto the landing and closes the door.

                                     TREVES
                         Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling 
                         today?

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                              (suspiciously)
                         Fine.

                                     TREVES
                         Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. 
                         Mothershead, I want you to come into 
                         this room with me. Inside there is a 
                         man with a rather... unfortunate 
                         appearance.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         I've heard.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes... Well, I want you to clear up 
                         a little mess, a breakfast tray was 
                         spilt. And bring up another breakfast. 
                         When you've done that, you and I 
                         shall give the man a bath. But, 
                         Mothershead, I'm counting on your 
                         many years of experience to get you 
                         through this, Above all, do not 
                         scream, do not cry out, or in any 
                         way show this man that you are 
                         frightened of him...

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Sir, you don't have to worry about 
                         me. I'm not the sort to cry out. 
                         Shall we go in?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes... Yes, let's go in.

               Treves opens the door.

               ISOLATION WARD

               Mothershead goes right to the mess.

                                     TREVES
                              (to the E.M., hereafter 
                              Merrick)
                         I would like you to meet Mrs. 
                         Mothershead - Mrs. Mothershead, Mr. 
                         John Merrick.

               Merrick looks up to Mothershead, then averts his eyes. He 
               looks back at her and sees she has no difficulty being in 
               his presence.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         How do you do?

               ISOLATION WARD LANDING

               At the door of Merrick's attic room stand two buckets of 
               very dirty water. We hear footsteps coming up stairs and see 
               a young porter carrying two buckets of clean, steaming water. 
               He puts them down, knocks on the door, and takes the dirty 
               water downstairs. The door opens, Mrs. Mothershead picks up 
               the steaming buckets and takes them inside, shutting the 
               door.

               ISOLATION WARD

               Merrick's seated in a tin bathtub trying to hide his 
               nakedness. Mrs. Mothershead pours the water in. She scrubs 
               his back with obvious distaste, but does her job. Months of 
               filth and accumulated excrescence are turning the bath water 
               a murky black. As Mothershead scrubs, Merrick slowly leans 
               forward in the bath, closing his eyes, apparently oblivious 
               to his surroundings.

               Treves sits beside him.

                                     TREVES
                         The disease is shocking.

               Merrick's eyes flicker.

                                     TREVES
                         I wonder how far it can go before 
                         it...

               Merrick flinches and pulls away.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Sit still. Don't wiggle about like a 
                         pup. I won't stand for any 
                         foolishness.

               Treves leans forward and looks at Merrick. Merrick grows 
               still, his eyes closed, apparently in a reverie.

                                     TREVES (V.O.)
                         It's pretty certain that if he had 
                         the disease as a child, he was 
                         abandoned. But in that case, he'd 
                         have to have had care. The very fact 
                         that he's alive bears that out...
                              (cut to Treves)
                         But, where?

               Merrick is listening.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         The workhouse.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes! The workhouse!

               At this word, Merrick begins to babble wildly. Obviously 
               alarmed, he thrashes about in the tub, spilling water onto 
               the floor. Treves, alarmed now himself, attempts to calm 
               Merrick, who, still babbling, tries to rise from the tub.

               Mothershead clamps a hand on Merrick's left arm. At her touch, 
               he is instantly subdued, at least physically. He sinks back 
               into the tub and begins to weep. Treves and Mothershead are 
               astounded by the tears rolling down Merrick's cheeks. They 
               stand motionless looking down at the agonized, naked elephant 
               man.

                                     TREVES
                              (softly)
                         The workhouse.

               FOLLOWING BUCKETS OF DIRTY WATER DOWN A HALLWAY BACK ENTRANCE - 
               ALLEY

               The young PORTER is exiting with great difficulty through a 
               large iron door carrying the two buckets. He sets one of the 
               buckets down, takes the other and splashes it out into the 
               alley. Some thick sludge dribbles from the empty bucket. 
               Unseen by him, the NIGHT PORTER is standing just to the side 
               and he now comes forward. The young Porter seems nervous in 
               his presence.

               The Night Porter looks at his spattered shoes, then up to 
               the Young Porter.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         What's all this, then?

                                     YOUNG PORTER
                         Mr. Treves is scrubbing his Elephant 
                         Man.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Elephant Man?

                                     YOUNG PORTER
                         Yeah... I hear it's a real horror. 
                         Even made Mothershead scream.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Friend of the night, eh? The Elephant 
                         Man. I think I'll have me a look at 
                         that.

               Suddenly the Night Porter kicks the other bucket of filthy 
               water violently, sending it splashing all over the young 
               Porter.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Now, you need the scrubbing, ducks!

               He lets his cigarette drop to the ground, then stamps and 
               grinds it with his brass-heeled boot, all the while smiling. 
               Then he turns on his heel and leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dark clouds rolling through an evening sky.

               ATTIC WARD

               Through the high barred window, we see the dark sky. The 
               E.M. is on his bed in his sleeping posture. A dim gaslight 
               burns in the room.

               CLOSE-UP of his head on the points of his knees. His breathing 
               is more regular now.

               A GENERAL WARD

               Lights are being turned off.

               ANOTHER WARD

               Lights go off.

               BACK ENTRANCE

               Large iron door is closed.

               HALLWAY

               Half the lights go off.

               HALLWAY

               Nurses leave for their quarters - half the lights go off.

               SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

               We hear the slow metallic footfalls of the Night Porter's 
               boots. He appears and walks into a darkened women's ward. 
               The women are all asleep. Some coughing fitfully, others 
               moaning quietly. The Night Porter walks down the aisle between 
               the beds. We see several of the sleeping women as he passes 
               them. Finally, he comes to a young beautiful woman, her eyes 
               wide open, watching him with intense fear. On either side of 
               her are two very ancient women, snoring deeply. The young 
               woman has her arms tied, suspended in traction above her. 
               The Night Porter moves to her, his shadow engulfing her.

               She starts to move, rattling the apparatus above her. The 
               Porter puts a finger to his lips.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Hush, love, I told you before one 
                         word from me, they'll toss you back 
                         on the street, and then those pretty 
                         little arms of yours will never grow 
                         straight. Now close your eyes.

               She turns her head away, closing her eyes. He moves in.

               CLOSE-UP of a gas light in a hallway. The leaping flame makes 
               a low roar.

               CUT TO ANOTHER HALLWAY

               Somewhere a door is opened and the squeak sounds vaguely 
               like the trumpeting of an elephant. We hear again the metallic 
               footfalls of the Night Porter's boots, and he appears. He 
               goes to the narrow stairway marked, "Isolation".

               He stops and casually looks about. He takes a swig of his 
               gin, then starts up the stairs.

               ATTIC WARD

               Merrick as before the light is very dim. We hear the echoing 
               footfalls of the Night Porter coming up the stairs. Merrick's 
               head immediately comes up from his knees. As it does, a small 
               object falls from where his head rested.

               He picks it up and puts it in a pocket of his cloak. it is 
               the portrait of the beautiful woman, which he saw in his 
               dream.

               Suddenly the door swings open and the Night Porter, bottle 
               in hand, is standing there. He walks into the room and sees 
               Merrick's shape on the bed.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Here he is, the old fiend of the 
                         night, the terror of the London. 
                         Let's have a look at you. Let's see 
                         what makes 'em scream...

               He turns up the light and sees Merrick clearly. The Night 
               Porter jumps back, awe struck.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Cor Blimey!

               Merrick is trembling. The Night Porter, hardly able to believe 
               his eyes, moves slowly toward Merrick. He is afraid but as 
               he reaches the bed, Merrick flinches back. The Night Porter 
               grins, his fear gone now. He is in control.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         So this is the Elephant Man. I ain't 
                         never seen nothing like you before. 
                         What the bleedin' hell happened to 
                         you?

               Merrick cowers as far away from the Night Porter as possible.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Oh... dumb, eh?

               He takes a big swallow of the gin and smiles.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Good. I likes people what can keep 
                         quiet.

               He offers Merrick his bottle with a swift, almost jabbing 
               motion. Merrick pulls away from him.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Like a drink? Go on... Go on have 
                         some. No? You should try being more 
                         sociable, mate.

               He tentatively presses the bottom of the bottle up against 
               the hanging growth on Merrick's chest. Encouraged, he touches 
               him with his fingers. Merrick makes a small whimpering sound.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                              (grinning)
                         You and I are going to be good 
                         friends, we are. And, I've got lots 
                         of friends who I know would like to 
                         meet you. And they will, mate... 
                         they will.

               He moves to the door and turns.

               CLOSE-UP of Night Porter's face.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Welcome to the London.

               He moves out the door and it closes. In the bed, Merrick 
               looks at the door with terror as the heavy footfalls of the 
               Night Porter recede down the stairs.

               WHITECHAPEL ROAD

               We see a horse's head in CU, snorting steam into the chill 
               morning air. The horse is harnessed to a milk wagon parked 
               in front of the London. Through the open back of the wagon 
               we see the MILKMAN, and past him Treves, walking towards us.

                                     MILKMAN
                         Here early again, eh Mr. Treves? If 
                         you don't mind my saying so, sir, 
                         with your early habits, you'd 'a 
                         made a fine milkman.

                                     TREVES
                         Good morning, Charley. I'll keep 
                         that in mind!

               Treves walks up the path into the hospital.

               HALLWAY (MORNING)

               Treves, carrying a bowl, crosses the upper hall and starts 
               to the narrow stairway to the Isolation Ward. Over his 
               shoulder we see him knock twice on the door. As the door 
               swings open, the camera pushes past him and we see the room. 
               The lamp is still burning, but Merrick is nowhere to be seen. 
               Treves enters, looking about for him.

                                     TREVES
                         Mr. Merrick?

               There's movement in the corner beside the bed. Merrick rises 
               slightly from the shadow. The light from the lamp hits his 
               frightened eyes.

                                     TREVES
                         ....Good morning... John. I've brought 
                         your breakfast.

               Treves is unsettled by the sight of Merrick cowering down on 
               the floor.

               Merrick begins to babble. Treves enters the room, placing 
               the bowl on the table and going to Merrick.

                                     TREVES
                         What are you doing down there? Come 
                         up John, come up on the bed. The 
                         cold floor is bad for you. I won't 
                         hurt you, come on now...

               He helps Merrick up onto the bed and goes back to the table 
               for the bowl.

                                     TREVES
                         You must eat. We must keep your 
                         strength...

               He has turned back to the bed, but Merrick has slipped to 
               the floor again, still trying to hide himself in the corner.

                                     TREVES
                         ...What on earth is the matter with 
                         you?

               He puts the bowl down again and goes back to Merrick, who 
               seems very upset at leaving his hiding place.

                                     TREVES
                         Now please, John, you must do as I 
                         say. Come up from there.

               He starts to help Merrick up, but Merrick just presses himself 
               farther back in the corner, still babbling. There are two 
               raps at the door. Treves goes to it and lets Mothershead in.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be 
                         his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?

                                     TREVES
                         Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. 
                         There seems to be some difficulty 
                         this morning.

               They both look at the bed. Merrick has almost disappeared 
               under it.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Won't come out, eh?

                                     TREVES
                         No, he's very upset about something.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle 
                         it.

               She goes to Merrick and takes hold of his left wrist.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Alright, my son, none of this fuss. 
                         Come up from there, this instant.

               She starts to force him up from the floor. Merrick is moaning 
               now, still trying to get away.

                                     TREVES
                         No! Don't pull at him like that. We 
                         don't want to frighten him more than 
                         he already is.

               By this time Mothershead has almost got him back on the bed.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Honestly, sir, you must be very firm 
                         with this sort. Otherwise they'd lay 
                         about on the floor gibbering all day 
                         long. All he understands is a good 
                         smack.

               They help Merrick settle back on the pillow. Merrick is still 
               making desperate, unintelligible sounds.

                                     TREVES
                         He's had his share of "smacks", 
                         Mothershead. I expect that's what 
                         drives him under the bed. We must 
                         use patience and understanding with 
                         this man.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Perhaps you've got the time for that, 
                         Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've 
                         got an entire hospital to look after, 
                         and you have your real patients. 
                         Don't waste your time with him sir, 
                         it's like talking to a wall. I don't 
                         mean to be harsh, but truthfully 
                         what can you do for him? I'll be 
                         back later for his bath. And Mr. 
                         Carr Gomm would like to see you when 
                         you have a moment. Good day sir.

               She exits. Treves shuts the door behind her and turns back 
               to the bed.

                                     TREVES
                              (to himself)
                         What good am I to you...?

               He goes to the bed and sits down in front of Merrick, angered 
               by his own seeming uselessness in the situation.

                                     TREVES
                         ...What is my purpose? ...It's so 
                         important that I understand you. I 
                         want to help you, I want to be your 
                         doctor...
                              (directly to Merrick)
                         but I can't help you unless you help 
                         me, unless I know what you are 
                         feeling. I believe there's something 
                         back there, there's something you 
                         want to say, but I've got to 
                         understand you. Do you understand 
                         me?

               Merrick hesitates, then starts babbling again.

                                     TREVES
                         No! You are going to talk to me! We 
                         are going to show them! We're going 
                         to show them that you're not a wall. 
                         We are going to talk! Do you 
                         understand? Nod your head if you 
                         understand me!

               Slowly Merrick nods yes.

                                     TREVES
                         You do understand me! You understand. 
                         Now you're going to say it. I've got 
                         to hear how you say things. Now, 
                         very slowly, say "yes."

               Treves carefully mouths the word.

                                     TREVES
                         "Yes."

               Merrick is still hesitant, from years of fear, but his eyes 
               betray a growing excitement. Slowly, he tries to talk, his 
               voice a tremulous whisper.

                                     MERRICK
                         Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.

                                     TREVES
                              (grabbing Merrick's 
                              arm)
                         Yes John!

               Throughout their dialogue, Merrick is still very garbled, 
               but he no longer babbles. He makes a great effort to speak 
               slowly, to form words the way Treves forms them, to be 
               understood.

                                     MERRICK
                         ...Yyes

                                     TREVES
                         Yyyess.

                                     MERRICK
                         Yyess.

                                     TREVES
                         That's much better. I could understand 
                         that "yes".

                                     MERRICK
                              (pleased)
                         Yes!

                                     TREVES
                         Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm 
                         going to say some things to you and 
                         I want you to repeat them... um... I 
                         want you to say them back to me. Do 
                         you understand? I'm going to say 
                         some things to you and I want you to 
                         say them back to me. Do you 
                         understand?

                                     MERRICK
                         Yes.

                                     TREVES
                         Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"

                                     MERRICK
                         Hello...

                                     TREVES
                         My name is...

                                     MERRICK
                         My... name is...

                                     TREVES
                         John Merrick.

                                     MERRICK
                         John... Merrick

                                     TREVES
                         Say "Merrick".

                                     MERRICK
                         Merrick...

                                     TREVES
                         Say "Mmmerrick."

                                     MERRICK
                         Mmmerrick.

                                     TREVES
                         Say "Mmmerrick."

                                     MERRICK
                         Mmmerrick.

                                     TREVES
                         Well, that's alright. I understand 
                         you. Now, say the whole thing again, 
                         Hello ...

                                     MERRICK
                              (haltingly)
                         Hello... my name is... John Merrick.

               DISSOLVE TO HALLWAY

               Mrs. Mothershead comes out of the kitchen with a supper tray 
               and walks down the hall, passing the open ward door. We see 
               nurses serving patients their supper. Nora comes out of the 
               ward with a tray which she holds tightly against her. A bowl 
               of soup is spilling on her apron. She catches up with 
               Mothershead. They speak as they walk.

                                     NORA
                         Oh, Mrs. Mothershead, please forgive 
                         my behavior yesterday. I'm sorry if 
                         you're having to do extra work on my 
                         account. It was just seeing it...

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Patients here are not "its". They 
                         are either "he's" or "she's", but 
                         that's alright, Ireland. This one's 
                         going to be more work for all of us. 
                         Good God girl! Mind your broth.

               Mothershead continues on. Nora guiltily watches her go.

               ISOLATION WARD

               Treves and Merrick are absorbed in their work. A knock comes 
               at the door.

                                     TREVES
                         Come in.

               Mothershead enters.

                                     TREVES
                         Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how 
                         good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, 
                         will you please introduce yourself?

                                     MERRICK
                              (hesitantly)
                         Hello, my name is John Merrick.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Good Lord, Mr. Treves!

                                     TREVES
                              (exuberantly)
                         We've made tremendous strides today, 
                         Mothershead. He listens and repeats 
                         with great attention, and this 
                         certainly isn't easy for him.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. 
                         It's all very nice, but I don't see 
                         the point. You know they won't let 
                         him stay here.

                                     TREVES
                              (lowering his voice)
                         I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a 
                         good impression on the hospital 
                         committee they'd see that he's the 
                         exception to their rule. Now I'm not 
                         expecting miracles. I'm not saying 
                         he'll be able to read or write, but 
                         I do think that I can get him to 
                         speak for himself. I'm going to 
                         arrange things with Carr Gomm right 
                         now.
                              (to Merrick)
                         That was very good, John, very good. 
                         That's all for today. We shall do 
                         some more tomorrow. Mothershead?

               Mrs. Mothershead sets the tray down beside Merrick.

                                     TREVES
                         I'll see you soon.

               He and Mothershead exit. Merrick watches the door close. He 
               sighs quietly, looks about, and sees the Bible on the bedside 
               table. He picks it up and, gently runs his fingers over the 
               cover.

               RECEIVING ROOM - THE LONDON

               There is total pandemonium in the receiving room. The room 
               is filled with screaming men, women and children. Two drunken 
               women have been fighting with broken bottles and are now 
               covered with blood and cuts. The women are still hysterical, 
               one minute they're sobbing, then in an instant screaming and 
               intent upon fighting again. The crowd keeps them apart. Two 
               Bobbies stand in the background making no move to intercede.

               To the side we see Bytes watching everything. It is still 
               too violent a scene for the Nurses to come to the women's 
               aide and they stand up in the front of the room waiting. 
               Bytes makes his way along the side of the crowd waiting for 
               a chance to get behind the Nurses and on into the hospital. 
               Now the women begin sobbing again and things quiet some. The 
               Nurses come forward into the crowd. Bytes moves over closer 
               to the hallways. When the Nurses have all gone into the crowd 
               he seizes the chance and disappears into the hospital.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bytes appears and walks down hospital hallway looking about.

               CARR GOMM'S OFFICE

               The door opens and Treves enters.

                                     CARR (V.O.)
                         Ah, Treves...

               Treves sits in the armchair. Carr Gomm is sitting at his 
               desk.

                                     CARR
                         Have you contacted the British Home 
                         and the Royal Hospital?

                                     TREVES
                         Ah, no sir. I had planned to see 
                         them in the morning.

                                     CARR
                         Good! How is the patient?

                                     TREVES
                         He's doing very well. In fact that's 
                         why I came to see you. I think that 
                         if I were to present Mr. Merrick to 
                         the hospital committee, then they 
                         would have a chance to see for 
                         themselves not only the extraordinary 
                         nature of the disease, but of the 
                         man as well. If the committee had a 
                         chance to speak with him, hear him 
                         say a few words for himself, I'm 
                         sure they would see him as a patient, 
                         rather than as a violation of the 
                         rules.

                                     CARR
                         A few words? I thought he was 
                         imbecile?

                                     TREVES
                         Well sir, perhaps I should explain...

                                     CARR
                         I really don't think that's necessary 
                         Treves. I'm quite sure the committee 
                         will be able to make an equitable 
                         decision on the merits of the case, 
                         such as they are.

                                     TREVES
                         I don't agree. No one can make a 
                         reasonable decision about this man's 
                         future without at least meeting him. 
                         No doctor would presume to diagnose 
                         a patient he had never met.

                                     CARR
                         No, Treves, it's out of the question. 
                         Now if it was up to me, I'd say 
                         "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, 
                         by all means," I'm sorry, I simply 
                         can't speak for the other members of 
                         the committee.

                                     TREVES
                         Then will you meet him, as a 
                         representative of the committee.

                                     CARR
                         Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. 
                         I want to hear as soon as possible 
                         what the other hospitals can do. I'm 
                         sorry.

               HALLWAY - STAIRCASE - THE LONDON

               We see Treves leave Carr Gomm's office and walk toward us to 
               the stairwell.

               As Treves begins down the stairs, he sees Bytes on the next 
               landing coming up.

               Bytes spots him and goes toward him.

                                     BYTES
                         I want my man back.

                                     TREVES
                         Just a moment, how did you get in 
                         here?

                                     BYTES
                         Never mind that, I want my man!

                                     TREVES
                         He's still very sick. Please come 
                         downstairs with me. I'll explain the 
                         situation.

                                     BYTES
                              (shouting)
                         DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've 
                         had plenty of time to fix him up, 
                         and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do 
                         you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. 
                         We had a bargain!

                                     TREVES
                         You misunderstood. This man suffered 
                         a severe fall, if you take my meaning. 
                         He's my patient now and I must do 
                         what...

                                     BYTES
                         Pull the other one, why don't you! 
                         We made a deal!

                                     TREVES
                         I know what you've done to him and 
                         he's never going back to that.

                                     BYTES
                         He's a freak! That's how they live. 
                         We're partners, him and I, business 
                         partners. You're willfully deprivin' 
                         me of my livlihood!

                                     TREVES
                         All you do is profit from another 
                         man's misery!

                                     BYTES
                         You think you're better 'n me? YOU 
                         wanted the freak to show all your 
                         doctor chums and make a name for 
                         yourself, you guv. So I gave him to 
                         you. On trust, in the name of science! 
                         And now I want him back.

                                     TREVES
                         You don't own this man!

                                     BYTES
                         I want him back!

                                     TREVES
                         So you can beat him? So you can starve 
                         him? A dog in the street would fare 
                         better with you!

                                     BYTES
                         I've got my rights, damn you, and 
                         I'm going to the authorities!

                                     CARR (V.O.)
                         Well, go to the authorities...

               Now we see Carr Gomm standing above them, at the top of the 
               stairs.

                                     CARR
                         By all means do so. In fact, I'll 
                         fetch them myself. I'm quite sure 
                         they'd be very interested in your 
                         story, as well as ours.

               Livid, Bytes looks from Carr Gomm to Treves, at a loss for 
               words.

                                     TREVES
                         Now I think we really do understand 
                         one another.

                                     BYTES
                              (venomously)
                         Right... Right.

               He backs slowly down to the landing eyeing Treves and Carr 
               Gomm. At the landing he casually turns and disappears down 
               more stairs. Treves turns and gazes at Carr Gomm.

                                     CARR
                         Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... 
                         I don't suppose there would be any 
                         harm in my meeting your... patient, 
                         Mr. Treves.

                                     TREVES
                              (gratefully)
                         Thank you very much Sir. Shall we 
                         say in a few days then?

                                     CARR
                         Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow 
                         afternoon?

                                     TREVES
                              (slightly taken aback)
                         Wh... whatever is most convenient 
                         for you, sir.

                                     CARR
                         Two o'clock then... you know Treves... 
                         It seems this acquaintance of yours 
                         has become rather more than just an 
                         acquaintance.

                                     TREVES
                         ...Yes, Sir.

               They part company. We follow Treves down the stairs.

                                     TREVES
                              (muttering)
                         Two o'clock?

               Then we follow Carr Gomm to his office door. He stops short.

                                     CARR
                              (mumbling out loud)
                         Elephant Man? I don't want to meet 
                         an Elephant Man.

               HALLWAYS - THE LONDON (NIGHT)

               Again, the hospital is closing down for the night. Lights go 
               off in each hallway. The staff is vacating the hospital. As 
               the last light goes off, we hear the great iron door slam 
               shut.

               TREVES' HOUSE - BEDROOM (NIGHT)

               Anne is at her dressing table, brushing out her hair. She is 
               in a very flattering dressing gown, ready to turn in. We see 
               her reflected in the mirror as well as Treves who is in his 
               robe in the background seated at his side of their bed, deep 
               in thought. Anne looks at Treves and smiles affectionately.

                                     ANNE
                              (coyly)
                         Freddie?

               Getting no response she renews her efforts.

                                     ANNE
                         Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so 
                         discouraged.

                                     TREVES
                         I shouldn't be. We made great progress 
                         today. I taught him to repeat a few 
                         basic phrases. He did rather well, 
                         too, but I had to lead him every 
                         step of the way. Though frankly, at 
                         times I was unsure of who was leading 
                         whom.

                                     ANNE
                         What do you mean?

                                     TREVES
                         Well, I wasn't sure whether he was 
                         parroting me because that's all he 
                         was capable of, or whether he sensed 
                         that that's all I wanted to hear, 
                         and he was trying to please me.

                                     ANNE
                         But I thought you said that he was 
                         rather... simple?

                                     TREVES
                         He is. I mean, I've always thought 
                         he was. I think he must be. Is he 
                         simple? Or is that just something 
                         I've wished upon him to make things 
                         simpler for myself?

               Anne puts down the brush and rises.

                                     ANNE
                         Frederick, why are you so interested 
                         in this particular case?

                                     TREVES
                         I don't know. I can't explain it. If 
                         this is an intelligent man, trapped 
                         in the body of a monster, then I'm 
                         under a moral obligation to help 
                         free that mind, free that spirit as 
                         best I can, to help him live as full 
                         and content a life as possible. But! 
                         If he's an imbecile, who's body I 
                         can't treat and who's mind I can't 
                         touch, well, then my obligation is 
                         discharged. They can put him where 
                         they will; he won't be bothered, I 
                         won't be bothered, and everyone's 
                         conscience can remain free and 
                         untroubled. And that is my dilemma... 
                         what is in his mind?

               Anne, sympathizing with his concerns goes to him and puts 
               her arms around him.

                                     ANNE
                         Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, 
                         endowing this Elephant Man with 
                         qualities he doesn't possess?

                                     TREVES
                              (impatiently)
                         And what qualities are those? 
                         Intelligence or stupidity?

                                     ANNE
                              (slightly hurt)
                         I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.

               She releases Treves and lies down. Treves realizes that 
               perhaps he has been unkind.

                                     TREVES
                         I'm sorry... I don't know either. I 
                         just don't know.

                                     ANNE
                         Well, these things take time.

                                     TREVES
                         I've only got until two o'clock 
                         tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm 
                         meets him. Somehow, between now and 
                         then I've got to make John Merrick 
                         at least seem like an intelligent 
                         man... Why am I fooling myself? 
                         Nothing short of John delivering the 
                         Sermon on the Mount is going to sway 
                         Carr Gomm...

               Anne sits back up and gently places her hand over Treves' 
               mouth. As she does so she leans forward and turns out the 
               light.

               ISOLATION WARD

               Merrick is propped up in bed. Suddenly the door bursts open. 
               The Night Porter, an arm around a drunken giggling tart, 
               stands in the doorway. As soon as the Charwoman sees Merrick, 
               she screams as does Merrick, and she wriggles free, making 
               for the stairs. The Night Porter watches her go and then 
               turns to Merrick laughing noisily. He then pulls the door 
               shut with a bang.

               Merrick, very frightened, crawls down into his hiding place.

               BEDROOM (MORNING)

               We see Anne alone in bed, asleep. Treves is finished dressing 
               and leaves the room. The sound of the door closing awakens 
               Anne. She looks around for Treves. A clock reads 5:30.

               ISOLATION WARD

               Merrick's disguise hangs on the wall.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not 
                         want, he maketh me to lie down in 
                         green pastures; He leadeth me beside 
                         still waters. He restoreth my soul: 
                         He Guideth me in the paths of 
                         righteousness...

                         Righteousness...

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         Righteousness for his namesake.

               WE NOW SEE TREVES AND MERRICK

                                     TREVES
                         Very good, very good. Now, when your 
                         visitor comes today I want you to 
                         say it exactly the way you said it 
                         just now. I will introduce him to 
                         you and you will say the words you've 
                         learned. If you have any trouble 
                         with any of the words, I'll help 
                         you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. 
                         If you do as well for him as you've 
                         done for me these last two days, 
                         then I'm sure our visitor will be 
                         very pleased. Now, let's go through 
                         the whole thing again, shall we? I 
                         will say "May I introduce you to Mr. 
                         Carr Gomm." And you will say...

                                     MERRICK
                         Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am 
                         very pleased to meet you!

               HALLWAY

               Treves and Carr Gomm are speaking together as they walk along.

                                     TREVES
                         It's only a physical problem. He has 
                         trouble with certain sounds because 
                         of the constrictive deformity of the 
                         mouth. But he can talk, and has a 
                         great eagerness to make contact with 
                         people who will let him. So if you 
                         have any difficulty understanding 
                         what he is saying, just tell me and 
                         I'll make it clear.

                                     CARR
                         Speaking is one thing, Treves, but 
                         can the man comprehend?

               Treves cannot easily answer this question.

                                     TREVES
                         ...As I said, it's only a physical 
                         problem... but I do feel that Mr. 
                         Merrick is very flattered that you're 
                         taking the time and trouble to meet 
                         him, and he's most anxious to make a 
                         good impression, so he might seem 
                         rather nervous.

                                     CARR
                         He needn't. I have no desire to cause 
                         him any discomfort. Did you make 
                         those inquiries we spoke about?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, I spoke to both the British 
                         Home and Royal Hospital for 
                         Incurables. I'm afraid that they 
                         weren't very encouraging, but they 
                         said they'd bring it up at their 
                         next committee meeting, so we should 
                         have their answers shortly.

                                     CARR
                         Fine, fine. You know, your dedication 
                         to this patient is an inspiring thing, 
                         Treves. But you must remember that 
                         this is a hospital, and there are 
                         many patients here. Patients who can 
                         be made well, and you owe them your 
                         first consideration. Just don't become 
                         so obsessed, old man, that you begin 
                         to neglect them.

               Carr Gomm starts up the stairs. Treves remains behind, 
               watching him for a moment, then follows.

               ISOLATION WARD

               Merrick is standing beside his disguise on its hook. He 
               nervously smooths the cloak down, repositions the Bible on 
               the bedside table and smooths the cloak again. He looks at 
               the door, expecting it to open. It doesn't. His hands smooths 
               the cloak over and over again. Voices can be heard outside 
               the door.

               Merrick freezes.

               There are two raps at the door. Merrick flinches, clutching 
               the cloak. The raps are repeated. He pulls himself together 
               and walks to the middle of the room. He takes a deep breath 
               and closes his eyes.

                                     MERRICK
                         Come in.

               The door opens and Treves and Carr Gomm enter. Carr Gomm's 
               eyes are rivited on Merrick, but he contains his shock.

               Merrick is breathing unevenly, his eyes still closed. Treves 
               goes to him and touches his shoulder. Merrick opens his eyes 
               and looks up at Treves. Treves turns to Carr Gomm, as does 
               Merrick. Carr Gomm lowers his eyes.

                                     TREVES
                         John, may I introduce you to Sir 
                         Carr Gomm.

                                     MERRICK
                         Hello... my name is John Merrick. I 
                         am very pleased to meet you.

               Carr Gomm, still shaken, instinctively offers his hand.

                                     CARR
                         I'm very... pleased to meet you.

               Before Carr Gomm can withdraw his hand, Merrick grasps it 
               with his left hand.

               There is an uncomfortable silence. Merrick releases it. Carr 
               Gomn, nervously clears his throat.

                                     CARR
                         How are you feeling today?

                                     MERRICK
                         I feel much better. Thank you for 
                         asking. And you?

                         I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How 
                         is your bronchitis?

                                     MERRICK
                         I feel much better. Thank you.

                         Are you comfortable here?

                         Everyone has been very kind. I am 
                         extremely grateful.

                         I am used to.

                         Potatoes...

               There is another agonizing silence.

                         But the variety of food here is very 
                         pleasing... I commend you.

                              (after a pause)
                         I understand that you were beaten?

               Merrick is at a loss. This is not part of the expected 
               scenario.

                                     DIERRICK

                         No, I meant in your former situation.

               Merrick doesn't seem to understand.

                                     MERRICK
                         I'm feeling much better now...

               Carr Gomm stares levelly at Treves for a moment, then asks 
               Merrick:

                                     CARR
                         Tell me, how do you like Mr. Treves?
                         As a teacher?

               Treves stiffens.

                                     MERRICK
                         ...I... everyone has been very kind 
                         to me.

                                     CARR
                         Of course. How long did you and Mr. 
                         Treves prepare for this interview?

               Merrick looks at Treves for guidance, but Treves cannot look 
               him in the eye.

                                     MERRICK
                         ...everyone has been very kind.

                                     CARR
                         Yes, of course... Well, it's been a 
                         pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. 
                         Good day.

                                     TREVES
                              (to John)
                         Thank you, John. You did very well.

               Treves and Carr Gomm go out the door onto the landing. Merrick 
               sees his chance escaping him and tries to recapture their 
               attention.

                                     MERRICK
                              (his voice is gaining 
                              strength)
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not 
                         want. He maketh me to lie down in 
                         green pastures...
                              (he continues through 
                              the following dialogue)

               Treves and Carr Gomm are alone on the landing, speaking 
               quietly.

                                     CARR
                         It was a nice try, Treves, but the 
                         man is so obviously mouthing your 
                         words.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted 
                         your time, sir. I just felt that I 
                         had to do anything I could to protect 
                         him.

                                     CARR
                         I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't 
                         belong here. He's be much happier 
                         somewhere else, where he could be 
                         constantly looked after. Believe me, 
                         Frederick, it's better that it worked 
                         out this way. Good day.

               Merrick has come to the end of what Treves taught him to 
               say. He makes one last, desperate attempt to be heard.

               Treves, disheartened, stands on the landing as Carr Gomm 
               starts down the stairs.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                              (now full voice)
                         Yea, though I walk through the valley 
                         of the shadow of death, I will fear 
                         no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy 
                         rod and Thy staff, they comfort me...

               Treves is staring, open-mouthed, back into the room. Carr 
               Gomm looks up at him.

                                     CARR
                         What is it, Treves?

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         Thou preparest a table before me in 
                         the presence of mine enemies, Thou 
                         anointest my head with oil...

                                     TREVES
                         I didn't teach him that part!

               Treves rushes back into the room, followed by Carr Gomm.

                                     MERRICK
                         My cup runneth over. Surely goodness 
                         and loving kindness shall follow me 
                         all the days of my life, and I shall 
                         dwell in the house of the Lord 
                         forever.

               There is a long silence as all three men stare at each other.

                                     TREVES
                         How did you, know the rest? I never 
                         taught you the rest of it.

                                     CARR
                         I don't understand.

                                     TREVES
                         Tell me, John, how did you know the 
                         rest of the 23rd Psalm?

                                     MERRICK
                              (hesitantly)
                         I... I used to read the Bible every 
                         day. I know it very well. The Bible, 
                         and the Book of Common Prayer. The 
                         23rd Psalm is very beautiful.

               ISOLATION WARD

               A few minutes later. We hear voices inside the room.

                                     CARR (V.O.)
                         It was a great pleasure to meet you, 
                         Mr. Merrick.

                                     MERRICK
                         I am very pleased to meet you.

                                     CARR
                         I hope we can talk together again 
                         sometime. Good day.

               The door opens and Carr Gomm and Treves come out.

                                     TREVES
                              (to Merrick)
                         I'll be right back.

               He closes the door.

                                     CARR
                         I want to see you in my office as 
                         soon as you're through up here. We've 
                         a good deal to discuss.

               He starts down the stairs.

                                     TREVES
                         Of course, sir. Thank you, thank you 
                         very much.

               Carr Gomm stops on the stairs.

                                     CARR
                         Treves. Well done.

                                     TREVES
                         Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded 
                         in spite of my shortsightedness.

               ISOLATION WARD

               Merrick is on the bed, propped up by pillows. The door opens. 
               Treves comes in, shuts the door and leans against it. They 
               look at each other for a moment.

                                     TREVES
                         Why did you let me go on like that, 
                         teaching you what you already knew? 
                         Why didn't you tell me you could 
                         read?

                                     MERRICK
                         You did not ask me.

                                     TREVES
                         I never thought to ask. How can you 
                         ever forgive me?

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh, no do not say that. You have 
                         been so kind to me. I was afraid to 
                         say too much. People always want me 
                         to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, 
                         but I was afraid. Forgive me.

                                     TREVES
                         We do have a lot to talk about, don't 
                         we?

               CARR GOMM'S OFFICE

               Carr Gomm is seated at the window, looking out silently. 
               There is a knock at the door and Treves enters. He quietly 
               closes the door and walks to the window. Carr Gomm never 
               moves.

                                     CARR
                         Can you imagine what his life has 
                         been like?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, I think I can.

                                     CARR
                         No you can't. You can't begin to 
                         know, no one can.

               Carr Gomm suddenly stands and faces Treves.

                                     CARR
                         You are quite right, Treves, this is 
                         an exceptional case. And I quite 
                         agree that the committee should see 
                         Mr. Merrick.

                                     TREVES
                         I could easily arrange...

                                     CARR
                         No, not that way. Broadneck and the 
                         others don't like to deal with 
                         patients directly. It makes them 
                         queasy... Do you have any photographs 
                         of Mr. Merrick?

                                     TREVES
                         Well, yes.

                                     CARR
                         Excellent. We shall present them, 
                         along with the other particulars of 
                         the case to the committee. I want 
                         them to see, exactly, how horribly 
                         his body has been affected. You and 
                         I shall vouch for his inner qualities.

                                     TREVES
                         Do you think they'll go along with 
                         us?

                                     CARR
                         Of course they will. They're 
                         reasonable men.

               ISOLATION WARD

               Merrick is in bed, very tired. It's been an exhausting day. 
               Suddenly the door opens and Mothershead comes into the room. 
               Merrick looks up at her very apprehensively. She walks over 
               to the bed, picks up the Bible from the table, opens it and 
               hands it to Merrick.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Read it.

               Merrick looks down at the Bible.

                                     MERRICK
                         Thou heardest my voice; hide not 
                         thine ear at my breathing, At my 
                         cry.

               Mothershead backs slowly to the door, deeply disturbed. She 
               stares at Merrick for a moment.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Credit where credit is due. You'll 
                         have the paper every morning at 
                         breakfast.

               She quickly turns and exits. Merrick looks down at the Bible. 
               It is open to "Lamentations".

               HALLWAY - THE LONDON (NIGHT)

               As before the lights are going off in one hallway after 
               another. The hallways are empty, dark and silent. We hear 
               the great iron door close with a bang.

               ISOLATION WARD (NIGHT)

               Merrick is in his bed as always. He holds the portrait of 
               the beautiful woman, gazing at it longingly. He hears a door 
               close far away in the silence of the hospital.

               Suddenly we hear the heavy footfalls of the Night Porter's 
               boots. As they get louder and louder we move slowly closer 
               to Merrick's face.

               The sound is very close now, and Merrick's eyes are visibly 
               agitated.

               Finally, the door bursts open and the Night Porter is standing 
               there. He stares malevolently at Merrick for a long moment 
               and then walks to him menacingly.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         I hear you have some trouble 
                         sleepin'...

               He grabs Merrick fiercely by the hair and jerks his head 
               back. Merrick immediately starts to wheeze and gasp.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Head's too heavy, eh?

               He pulls Merrick all the way down onto the bed, so that he 
               is prone, struggling for breath.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         And I heard a nasty rumor about you; 
                         I heard you can talk but you can't, 
                         can you... can you... can you?...

                                     MERRICK
                              (struggling)
                         Noooo!

               The Night Porter is as first surprised, and then pleased at 
               the desperate sound.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         No... No you can't! One word about 
                         me out of that stinking cakehole... 
                         Just ONE word, and you'll have no 
                         trouble at sleepin'... no trouble at 
                         all. You understand me? Do you!!

                                     MERRICK
                              (croaking)
                         Yyyesss.

               Satisfied, the Night Porter rights Merrick who is just able 
               to catch his breath. The Night Porter smiles and pats Merrick 
               on the shoulder.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         There now, that's better, i'n' it?

               HALLWAY

               Treves and Carr Gomm are on their way to the committee 
               meeting, confident of their position. Treves is holding a 
               folder, and Carr Gomm is looking at the photographs of 
               Merrick.

                                     CARR
                         As far as I can see, the only obstacle 
                         might be Broadneck. He has enormous 
                         influence over the others, very old 
                         school, not an easy man to impress. 
                         In any case, if worse does come to 
                         worse, we still have the British and 
                         Royal Homes to fall back on, don't 
                         we.

               Treves is silent. They stop.

                                     CARR
                         Don't we?

                                     TREVES
                         No, we don't. Their committees have 
                         informed me that they're unwilling 
                         to take Mr. Merrick, even if they 
                         were supplied with funds. They don't 
                         want him.

                                     CARR
                         Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?

               They continue walking.

                                     CARR
                         Don't worry Treves, we'll make them 
                         see it our way.

               He looks at the pictures.

                                     CARR
                         They've eyes, haven't they?

               They go through a door marked "Committee Room".

               COMMITTEE ROOM - THE LONDON HOSPITAL

               We see a pair of hands. One of the photographs of Merrick is 
               passed to them.

               They hold it for a moment, then lay it down flat on the table. 
               One of the hands covers the photograph with a piece of paper.

                                     TREVES (V.O.)
                         ...Due to the progressive nature of 
                         the disease, I feel sure that the 
                         patient does not have much longer to 
                         live.

               We pan up from the hands to see BROADNECK, his face pinched 
               with disgust. He sniffs, and gazes coolly at Treves.

                                     TREVES
                         Forgive the redundancy, gentlemen, 
                         but there is no other place for him. 
                         Both the Royal Hospital and the 
                         British Home have turned him down 
                         even if sufficient funds for his 
                         care were provided. The workhouse is 
                         certainly out of the question. The 
                         patient has an overwhelming fear of 
                         returning to the horrors of his past. 
                         His appearance is so disturbing that 
                         all shrink from him. He cannot, in 
                         justice to others, be put in the 
                         general ward of the workhouse. The 
                         police rightly prevent his being 
                         exhibited, and he is mobbed in the 
                         streets wherever he goes. What is to 
                         be done with him?

                                     BROADNECK
                         I, for one, am sick and tired of 
                         this competitive freak-hunting by 
                         these overly ambitious young doctors, 
                         trying to make names for themselves. 
                         To parade then about in front of the 
                         pathological society is one thing, 
                         but to waste this committee's valuable 
                         time with requests for shelter for 
                         these abominations of nature is quite 
                         another.

                                     TREVES
                         Gentlemen, John Merrick is not an 
                         animal, he is a man, fully aware of 
                         his condition. An intelligent, 
                         sensitive, literate man, with an 
                         intimate knowledge of the Bible. His 
                         horrible infirmities do not reduce 
                         him to anything less than what he 
                         is, a man; and it would be criminal 
                         if we of the London Hospital, his 
                         final refuge, the last place on earth 
                         where this man can find peace, were 
                         to cast him out.

               Carr Gomm, from his chair on the committee, pounds his gavel.

                                     CARR
                         Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion. 
                         There are two small rooms off Bedstead 
                         Square that are no longer in use and 
                         would be admirably suited to Mr. 
                         Merrick's needs. I also propose to 
                         write a letter to The Times, appealing 
                         to their readers for assistance. 
                         Knowing the generosity of the British 
                         public, I feel we would have little 
                         trouble in raising the funds for his 
                         maintenance. Indeed, this hospital's 
                         rules do preclude the admission of 
                         incurables, but if ever there was an 
                         exception to the rule, it is this 
                         patient. So therefore, I propose, if 
                         Mr. Treves is finished, that we put 
                         it to a vote. All those in favor of 
                         keeping Mr. Merrick here?

               Carr Gomm and another committee member raise their hands. 
               Broadneck is displeased.

                                     BROADNECK
                         One moment,
                              (showing the picture 
                              of Merrick)
                         as far as I'm concerned this creature 
                         has no business being in our hospital. 
                         I think Mr. Carr Gomm's letter would 
                         be an excellent idea,
                              (to Carr Gomm)
                         and when you appeal for funds, I 
                         think you should appeal for a more 
                         appropriate place for him as well. I 
                         agree the British public is generous, 
                         and I'm sure that somewhere the 
                         creature will find a happy and 
                         permanent home, but not here.

               One of the committee members says "I quite agree". Carr Gomm 
               scowls a bit.

                                     CARR
                         I see. All, then, that move we keep 
                         Mr. Merrick here?

               Carr Gomm raises his hand. None of the others do. Treves and 
               Carr Gomm exchange hopeless glances. Carr Gomm looks at the 
               man who had originally raised his hand. He looks away, 
               ashamed.

                                     CARR
                         All those opposed?

               Broadneck and the rest raise their hands.

                                     CARR
                         I see.

                                     BROADNECK
                              (triumphantly)
                         Well then. In the meantime, of course, 
                         he needn't be turned out. He may 
                         stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square 
                         until such time as more suitable 
                         arrangements can be made, thus freeing 
                         the Isolation Ward for more deserving 
                         patients. Well then, Mr. Chairman, 
                         if there is nothing further to 
                         discuss, I move that we adjourn this 
                         meeting and all go bout our normal 
                         business.

               Carr Gomm cannot conceal his contempt.

                                     CARR
                         I second the motion gentlemen. This 
                         meeting is adjourned.

               The others cough their agreement and hurriedly leave the 
               room. Treves walks over to the committee table and takes the 
               paper off the photograph. He stares sadly at Merrick's 
               picture.

                                     CARR (V.O.)
                         Somehow I don't think they quite 
                         understand.

               THEATRE DRESSING ROOM

               We see a very lovely WOMAN seated in a chair before a mirror. 
               She is reading aloud from The Times. Her hair is being brushed 
               by a YOUNG GIRL.

                                     WOMAN
                         ...terrible though his appearance 
                         is, so terrible indeed that women 
                         and nervous persons fly in terror 
                         from the sight of him, and that he 
                         is debarred from seeking to earn his 
                         livelihood in any ordinary way, yet 
                         he is superior in intelligence, can 
                         read and write, is quiet, gentle, 
                         not to say even refined in his mind.

               She turns to the girl thoughtfully.

                                     WOMAN
                         I'd very much like to meet that 
                         gentleman. He sounds almost 
                         Shakespearean.

               DINING HALL - THE LONDON

               The room is elegantly furnished and heavily carpeted. The 
               walls are panelled in richly gleaming walnut with finely 
               wrought brass lamps spaced regularly along their length. In 
               the center of the room is a long oak table with a fine linen 
               table cloth, around which sits a number of Doctors, among 
               them, Fox.

               Some of them are still eating. A waiter is clearing away a 
               few plates and several Doctors are helping themselves to 
               port wine kept in decanters in the center of the table and 
               to cigars in humidors. One of them is reading The Times. At 
               one end of the table sits Treves, picking at his food.

                         Do continue reading, Mr. Stanley, 
                         please.

                                     #1 DOCTOR
                         "...it is a case of singular 
                         affliction brought about through no 
                         fault of himself; he can but hope 
                         for quiet and privacy during a life 
                         which Mr. Treves assures me is not 
                         likely to be long,"

               There is a short pause.

                                     #4 DOCTOR
                         The Elephant Man. Makes you sound 
                         rather more like a zoo-keeper than a 
                         surgeon, Frederick.

               The group again laughs. Treves clears his throat and rises.

                                     TREVES
                         Excuse me gentlemen. I seem to have 
                         lost my appetite. Good evening.

               Treves leaves the room.

                                     #4 DOCTOR
                         I say, what's he on about?

                                     #3 DOCTOR
                         He's getting a bit of a swelled head, 
                         if you ask me.

                                     FOX
                              (coldly)
                         Well, no one did ask you Atkins.
                         Frederick Treves is not only the 
                         most skillful surgical operator here, 
                         he's also a humanitarian of the 
                         highest order. You sound like a pack 
                         of whining school boys with your 
                         petty jealousies.

                                     #3 DOCTOR
                         Look here, Fox, I simply said.

                                     FOX
                         Oh belt up!

               A deep silence falls over the Doctors.

               BEDSTEAD SQUARE ROOMS (NIGHT)

               We see a small, very dusty, dirty room, filled with boxes 
               and bedsteads and other things stored over the years. The 
               one grimy window is locked shut.

               The door opens and two middle-aged CHARWOMEN enter. They 
               look around at the room with distaste and drop their mops 
               and buckets.

                                     1ST WOMAN
                         There are cleaner rooms in the 
                         gasworks.

               She reaches into her apron pocket and pulls out a pint bottle 
               of gin. She takes a drink and passes it to her friend.

                                     1ST WOMAN
                         Who's all the fuss for, then?

                                     2ND WOMAN
                              (wiping her mouth)
                         Don't you know? It's for that strange 
                         one.

                                     1ST WOMAN
                         Mr. Treves' Elephant Man? I hear 
                         he's got a trunk.

                                     2ND WOMAN
                         Right, right.

               The 1st Woman takes the bottle and walks across the room. 
               She forces open the balky window and sits on the sill.

                                     2ND WOMAN
                         Blimey, now we're cleanin' up for 
                         circus animals!

               The 1st Woman, laughing, takes another healthy swig from the 
               bottle. We see past her through the window, the dark 
               silhouette of the main spire of St. Philip's Cathedral against 
               the sky.

               It fills the screen.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ISOLATION WARD

               Merrick sitting on his bed, hunched over in concentration 
               reading an Illustrated London News. He is staring at a picture 
               of the Eddystone Lighthouse.

                                     MERRICK
                              (reading softly)
                         "A silent shaft of stone on a deserted 
                         promontory, the lonely Eddystone is 
                         a beacon of aid and comfort to 
                         mariners of all nations."

               He looks at the picture silently. There is a knock at the 
               door. Merrick says, "Come in". Treves enters, holding a book.

                                     TREVES
                         Good evening. How are you feeling?

                                     MERRICK
                         Good evening. Very well, thank you. 
                         And you?

                                     TREVES
                         Very well, thank you. I have something 
                         for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy 
                         it, it's very popular.

               He holds the book out to him. It's an "Alice In Wonderland".

                                     MERRICK
                              (surprised)
                         Thank you... so much... oh it's 
                         beautiful!

               He lovingly feels the leather binding and looks at Treves 
               with speechless gratitude.

               Merrick carefully opens the book to a colored frontpiece, 
               the picture of Alice grown too large for a hallway, looking 
               imploringly at the dwarfed White Rabbit. The caption reads 
               "...curiouser and curiouser". He leafs through the pages 
               looking at the other illustrations as Treves, delighted with 
               the gift's effect, looks on.

                                     TREVES
                         I came to tell you that I'll be here 
                         early tomorrow morning. We're moving 
                         you to your permanent home. I'm sure 
                         you'll be very happy there, John. So 
                         get a good night's rest, there'll be 
                         new people to meet tomorrow. Good 
                         night.

               Treves smiles broadly and exits.

                                     MERRICK
                              (weakly)
                         Good night.

               Treves' words have disturbed Merrick. He sinks into the 
               pillows, the book before him. We see the picture of the Mock 
               Turtle perched upon his rock, great tears rolling down his 
               cow-like face, as Alice and the Gryphon look on with intense 
               sympathy. Merrick looks up at his disguise hanging on the 
               wall.

               THE PEACOCK PUB - WHITECHAPEL

               The Night Porter enters and saunters over to the noisy crowd. 
               As they welcome him, he slaps down The Times on the bar 
               counter for all to see.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Here... listen to this. This is a 
                         letter to THE London Times from the 
                         guvnor of the hospital.
                              (starts to read)
                         There is now in a little room off 
                         one of our attic wards a man named 
                         John Merrick, so dreadful a sight 
                         that he is unable even to come out 
                         by daylight to the garden. He has 
                         been called The Elephant Man on 
                         account of his terrible deformity...

               The Night Porter has the undivided attention of the people 
               in the pub.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         ...His appearance is so terrible 
                         that woman and nervous persons fly 
                         in terror at the sight of him.
                              (pauses)
                         ...and guess who can get you tickets 
                         to see him? Your own Sunny Jim!

                                     YOUNG MAN IN CROWD
                         Let's go see him, then!

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Keep your shirts on.
                              (shaking his finger 
                              at them)
                         ...When the time is right. Right now 
                         he's in the attic but tomorrow they're 
                         movin' him into Bedstead Square, 
                         right into my lap... then... for the 
                         right price you'll see something 
                         you'll never see again in your life.

               He lifts his glass to his lips. We move back to see Bytes' 
               boys who, having heard the Night Porter's words, slips 
               unnoticed from the pub.

                                     MERRICK
                              (wheezing)
                         Workhouse!

               HALLWAY - MOVING DAY

               Merrick, in his disguise, and Treves, one arm around him, 
               are walking together. Merrick seems very uneasy.

               A Nurse, on duty early or late getting off, passes them. She 
               stares at the hooded figure. They continue on in silence.

               BEDSTEAD SQUARE ROOM

               The room is now spotless. It is furnished with a bed and the 
               required pillows, a small table and chair by the window, now 
               curtained. Adjoining this room is a smaller one which contains 
               a bathtub.

               Merrick enters and looks around, confused. Treves stands in 
               the doorway.

               Merrick turns to him.

                                     TREVES
                         This is your new home, John.

               Merrick pulls off his hood. His eyes are bewildered.

                                     MERRICK
                         This... is my new home?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes.

                                     MERRICK
                              (incredulous)
                         The hospital?

                                     TREVES
                         Of course! What did you think?

               Merrick's eyes glisten with held back tears. He lowers them.

                                     MERRICK
                              (almost sobbing)
                         How long will I stay here?

                                     TREVES
                         I promise you. You will never see 
                         the inside of that horrible place 
                         again. You will never, ever go back 
                         to the workhouse... or that man. 
                         It's a splendid room, don't you think?

               Merrick inspects his new home. He seems pleased-by the 
               bathtub, by the table, by the window to the outside world.

               Merrick pulls the curtain aside and opens the window. He 
               looks out and then up with a small intake of breath. Before 
               him, beyond the hospital fence, the spire of St. Phillips 
               Cathedral stands resplendently in the morning light.

                                     MERRICK
                         When I'm next moved may I go to a 
                         lighthouse?... or to a blind-asylum?

               HALLWAY

               We see Carr Gomm walking to his office. He is met at the 
               door by an anxious Treves.

                                     TREVES
                         Has the response picked up?

                                     CARR
                         Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd 
                         expected. A few small cheques. Well-
                         wishers. Don't worry, these things 
                         undoubtedly take time.

                                     TREVES
                         But he's so afraid he's going to be 
                         carted off. I've promised him that 
                         won't happen.

                                     CARR
                         Well... I'll let you know if there's 
                         something in the afternoon post.

                                     TREVES
                         Please do.

               Carr Gomm goes back into his office and Treves walks off.

               MERRICK'S ROOM (A WHILE LATER)

               There is no one in the room. The bathroom door opens and 
               Nora and another nurse enter, carrying buckets which they 
               set down by the hall door. They straighten up and lean back 
               against it.

               Mrs. Mothershead enters from the bathroom, speaking over her 
               shoulder to Merrick.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Well, I think I can safely hand the 
                         duties over to you girls now. Mr. 
                         Merrick will require a bath every 
                         day... that way he won't pong quite 
                         so much. Nora, you can instruct 
                         Kathleen on the finer points of Mr. 
                         Merrick's bath. You'll be on your 
                         own tomorrow.

               The girls try to keep bright faces.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Don't look so glum girls. Such 
                         enthusiastic volunteers should be 
                         more cheerful.

               Mothershead starts to exit.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Oh, and girls, under no circumstances 
                         are there to be any mirrors brought 
                         into this room.

               She exits.

                                     KATHLEEN
                         He's... so ugly!

                                     NORA
                         Ugly or not, you're going to help 
                         me.

               Merrick quietly enters the room, dressed in a billowy white 
               shirt and baggy black pants. The two nurses try to smile, 
               but he cannot look at them.

                                     NORA
                         Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

                                     MERRICK
                         Yes.

               Kathleen's eyes go wide at the sound.

                                     NORA
                         You look very nice in your new 
                         clothes.

               Merrick looks down at himself.

                                     MERRICK
                         Thank you very much.

                                     NORA
                         Well, if there is nothing more, I 
                         suppose we'll be leaving you now.

                                     MERRICK
                         No, nothing.

               The girls leave, taking the buckets.

               Merrick, alone, walks about the room getting the feel of his 
               new clothes.

               There is a knock at the door and Treves enters.

                                     TREVES
                         You look splendid, John.

                                     MERRICK
                         Thank you very much.

                                     TREVES
                         When one is invited to tea, one must 
                         look one's best.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ENTRY HALL AND SITTING ROOM - TREVES' HOME

               The door opens. Merrick, disguised, enters, followed by Treves 
               who closes it and hangs up Merrick's mask on the coat rack. 
               The mirror has been removed, leaving a faint outline on the 
               wall.

               Merrick is enchanted by the house. Treves takes him by the 
               arm and leads him into the sitting room. Anne appears at the 
               top of the stairs.

                                     TREVES (V.O.)
                         Make yourself comfortable, John.

               Treves comes back to the foot of the stairs and smiles up at 
               Anne.

                                     TREVES
                         Come and meet our quest, my love.

               Anne manages a smile, comes down the stairs and together 
               they go into the sitting room.

               Merrick is examining everything in the room. Nothing in this 
               almost magical world escapes his attention. The furniture, 
               the personal mementoes, particularly the pictures on the 
               fireplace. He turns around when he hears them enter, lowering 
               his eyes.

                                     TREVES
                         John Merrick, I'd like you to meet 
                         my wife, Anne Treves.

               Anne is startled, but conceals it very well.

                                     ANNE
                              (smiling)
                         I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. 
                         Merrick.

               Anne extends her hand. John takes her hand and looks up very 
               slowly meeting her eyes. Anne smiles.

                                     MERRICK
                         I'm very...

               Then, Merrick bursts into tears. Anne is at a loss as to 
               what to do. Merrick takes his hand from hers and covers his 
               eyes, weeping pitiously. Treves puts his hand on Merrick's 
               shoulder.

                                     TREVES
                         John... what's the matter? John... 
                         why are you upset?

                                     MERRICK
                              (sobbing)
                         I'm not used to such kindness. From 
                         a beautiful woman.

               Treves and Anne exchange worried looks.

                                     ANNNE
                         Would you like a nice cup of tea, 
                         Mr. Merrick?

                                     MERRICK
                              (still sobbing)
                         Yes... thank you.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, a cup of tea would go nicely.

               Anne goes now to get the tea.

                                     TREVES
                         John... would you like to see the 
                         rest of the house?

               Merrick cannot answer through his sobs.

                                     TREVES
                         Come with me, John. I'll show it to 
                         you.

               KITCHEN

               Anne is composing herself by busily fixing the tea and cakes. 
               She stops for a moment, takes a breath, and then resumes her 
               activity.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Treves and Merrick coming down the stairs. Merrick is calm 
               now. They go into the sitting room, where Anne is just setting 
               the tea tray out. Treves ushers Merrick to a highbacked sofa 
               and sits him down. Merrick is very shy of Anne.

               Treves and Anne sit on the other side of the table.

                                     ANNE
                         Mr. Merrick, sugar?

                                     MERRICK
                         Yes please, two.

                                     ANNE
                         One or two?

                                     MERRICK
                         Two, please.

               Anne serves the tea.

                                     TREVES
                         John loves the house.

                                     ANNE
                         Do you?

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh yes. You have so many nice things, 
                         and so much room.

                                     ANNE
                         Oh?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, we do have a lot of room. But 
                         you should see the place on weekends, 
                         when I see patients here. Sometimes 
                         there are so many, we have to set 
                         them down wherever we can. In fact, 
                         Mrs. Treves sometimes says that the 
                         only room she can call her own is 
                         the bedroom.

               Treves and Anne laugh good-naturedly. Merrick's face, as 
               always, is quite blank.

                                     MERRICK
                              (earnestly)
                         Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do 
                         you call that thing above the bed?

                                     TREVES
                         That's a canopy, John.

                                     MERRICK
                         Ohhh...

                                     TREVES
                         How is your tea, John?

                                     MERRICK
                         It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit 
                         with you very much. It's so very 
                         kind of you to have me as a guest in 
                         your home. I'm sorry I made a 
                         spectacle of myself.

                                     TREVES
                         Not at all, John.

                                     MERRICK
                         I love the way you've arranged your 
                         pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that 
                         the way it's done in most houses?

                                     TREVES
                         Oh yes.

                                     MERRICK
                         Who are they of?

                                     TREVES
                         Oh, our relatives... the children.

                                     MERRICK
                         The children! May I see?

                                     TREVES
                         Of course.

               Treves goes to the fireplace and takes down a few pictures. 
               He hands a picture of the girls to Merrick.

                                     MERRICK
                              (as if looking at an 
                              icon)
                         The Children. Where are your children

                                     TREVES
                         Oh, they're gone for the day... with 
                         friends.

                                     MERRICK
                              (the word gives him 
                              pleasure)
                         Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.

                                     ANNE
                         And here is one of Frederick's mother.

                                     MERRICK
                         How lovely.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes.

                                     ANNE
                         And here are my mother and father.

                                     MERRICK
                         They have noble faces.

                                     ANNE
                              (a cord is struck)
                         I've always thought that myself.

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh, yes.

               Merrick sets the picture down carefully.

                                     MERRICK
                              (ever so timidly)
                         Would you... would you like to see 
                         my mother?

                                     TREVES
                              (startled)
                         Your mother?

                                     MERRICK
                         Here.

               He reaches into his cloak and brings out the small portrait 
               of the beautiful woman. Treves is absolutely amazed. Merrick 
               gently hands the picture to Anne.

                                     ANNE
                         Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.

                                     MERRICK
                         She has the face of an angel... She 
                         was an angel. She was so kind... so 
                         kind to me. It's not her fault, for 
                         in the fourth month of her maternal 
                         condition she was knocked down by an 
                         elephant. I'm sure I must have been 
                         a great disappointment to her.

                                     ANNE
                              (visibly touched)
                         Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as 
                         loving as you are could ever be a 
                         disappointment.

                                     MERRICK
                         If only I could find her. If only 
                         she could see me now, here, with 
                         such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. 
                         Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then 
                         maybe she would love me as I am. 
                         I've tried to hard to be good.

               At this, Anne is so extremely touched that she begins to 
               cry. She tries to hold it in, but to no avail. She reaches a 
               hand out to Merrick and he takes it. He tries to comfort 
               her.

                                     MERRICK
                         Please... please...

               But Anne goes on, as Treves, in wonder, watches her and 
               Merrick locked together in the communication of intense 
               sympathy.

               REAR ENTRANCE - THE LONDON

               Merrick, in the dimly lit rear hall, is huddled over a trash 
               can tucked underneath a stairway. He pulls out a discarded 
               drug box. He holds it closely to his chest and goes into his 
               room.

               MERRICK'S ROOM

               Merrick goes to his table and puts the box down. He hangs up 
               his disguise, then goes back to the window and pulls the 
               curtains aside. Moonlight bathes the table, illuminating the 
               portrait of his Mother. John seats himself and sets the box 
               in front of him. He reaches for a pencil, and then begins to 
               draw windows on the front of the box.

               OUTSIDE MERRICK'S ROOM (MORNING)

               Nora is coming down the hall with a breakfast tray. She stops 
               at Merrick's door and raises a hand to knock.

               MERRICK'S ROOM

               Merrick, as before, is hunched over the table, pencil in 
               hand. The sides of the box are covered with carefully drawn 
               windows and archways.

               There is a knock at the door and Merrick, startled, looks 
               up. Nora enters and puts the tray on the table. She glances 
               at the box.

                                     NORA
                         Good morning, Mr. Merrick.

                                     MERRICK
                         Good morning.

               She turns and walks to the cabinet for linen and bath 
               supplies. She opens it and takes out a clean towel and a 
               blanket. She pauses, and turns to look back at the table.

               Merrick is concentrated on his work. Nora, curious now, walks 
               to the table.

               Merrick, conscious of her presence, leans back in his chair 
               and looks up at her.

                                     NORA
                         What is this that you're doing?

               Merrick is silent.

                                     NORA
                              (pointing at the box)
                         What is it?

               Merrick points through the window.

                                     NORA
                         What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. 
                         Oh, of course. Why... why that's 
                         very good, I mean you've gotten the 
                         windows and arches just right.

                                     MERRICK
                         Yes.

                                     NORA
                         But it's so good, I mean... it's so 
                         very good.

                                     MERRICK
                         Thank you... very much.

                                     NORA
                         Where did you get this box?

               Merrick points out toward the hallway.

                                     NORA
                         The hallway? Oh, the wastecan! 

                                     MERRICK
                         I meant no harm, it was the only 
                         place where I could find cardboard. 
                         I thought it has been thrown away.

                                     NORA
                         It's alright, it was thrown away. No 
                         one wants it. It's just that it's a 
                         little dirty, that's all.

               She sets the towel and blanket down as she leans closer to 
               inspect the box.

               She points to a circle drawn on top.

                                     NORA
                         What's this?

                                     MERRICK
                         The main spire.

                                     NORA
                         The... oh, the spire! How silly of 
                         me, it's as plain as day... Mr. 
                         Merrick, where did you learn to do 
                         this?

                                     MERRICK
                         ...I learned a long time ago.

               Nora looks at the box.

                                     NORA
                         Oh, but how will you finish it? You 
                         haven't any more cardboard.

               Merrick, at a loss, shrugs his shoulders. The movement makes 
               Nora aware of his body, and he is the Elephant Man once again.

                                     MERRICK
                         I'll have to find some more.

                                     NORA
                              (uncomfortably)
                         Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.

               She quickly exits. Merrick watches her go and then turns 
               back to his work.

               He sees the towel and the blanket. He turns quickly to call 
               after Nora, but stops himself. Merrick takes up the towel 
               and blanket, walks into the bathroom, and carefully drapes 
               the towel over the back of the bath.

               MERRICK'S ROOM

               Merrick is at his table working on his cathedral. There is a 
               knock at the door.

                                     MERRICK
                         Come in.

               Treves enters.

                                     TREVES
                         Good morning, John.

                                     MERRICK
                         Good morning.

                                     TREVES
                         John, there's someone here who would 
                         like to meet you. Would that be 
                         alright?

               Merrick is a trifle apprehensive, but he agrees. Treves ushers 
               MRS. KENDAL through the door. At the sight of her, Merrick's 
               eyes go wide.

                                     TREVES
                         John, I'd like you to meet one of 
                         the brightest lights of the British 
                         stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, 
                         John Merrick.

                                     KENDAL
                         Good day, Mr. Merrick.

                                     MERRICK
                         Good day...!

                                     KENDAL
                         I've brought you some things. I hope 
                         you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you 
                         don't think it too forward.

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh, no.

                                     KENDAL
                         I knew you'd understand. Here.

               She-hands Merrick a nicely framed picture of herself. Merrick 
               is speechless, overjoyed by the gift.

                                     KENDAL
                         I want you to know that I don't go 
                         about giving my pictures to just 
                         anyone.

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh, no. I would never think it! It's 
                         so beautiful. You are so... I'll 
                         give it a place of honor, here, next 
                         to my mother.

               He places it, with great care, next to his mother's portrait.

                                     KENDAL
                         She's very pretty, your mother.

                                     MERRICK
                         Yes.

               Treves smiles at them.

               Merrick is a trifle nervous but Mrs. Kendal smiles at him 
               and he relaxes a little.

                                     MERRICK
                         Mr. Treves says that you are in the 
                         theatre. Do you live there?

                                     KENDAL
                         Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.

                                     MERRICK
                         Well, even to work there would be 
                         wonderful. Is it beautiful?

                                     KENDAL
                         You've never been?

                                     MERRICK
                         Alas, no.

                                     KENDAL
                         Well you must go. It is one of the 
                         most beautiful places on earth. Of 
                         course, I'm rather partial.

                                     MERRICK
                         Tell me about it, please!

                                     KENDAL
                         It's very difficult to put into a 
                         nutshell, but I should say the theater 
                         is the shrine of the imagination, 
                         where one may suspend disbelief and 
                         travel anywhere in the world, to any 
                         time you desire. You may look over 
                         the shoulders of kings, unobserved, 
                         battle with ruthless tyrants, and 
                         marry the beautiful princess, all in 
                         the space of a few hours. Onstage 
                         you may be whoever you wish to be, 
                         do anything you please, and always, 
                         always live happily ever after. The 
                         theatre is all the brightest and 
                         best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. 
                         It is lights and music, gaiety and 
                         joy. It's... well, it's romance.

                                     MERRICK
                              (the magic word)
                         Romance!

                                     KENDAL
                         That's one thing the theatre has in 
                         great store. which reminds me. I 
                         have something else for you...

               She produces a beautiful leather-bound volume of Shakespeare's 
               works. Merrick takes it with reverence and begins to leaf 
               through it.

                                     KENDAL
                         Have you read it?

                                     MERRICK
                         No, but I certainly shall.

               Merrick finds a place and begins to read.

                                     MERRICK
                         Romeo and Juliet. I know of this... 
                         "If I profane with my unworthiest 
                         hand, This holy shrine, the gentle 
                         fine is this: My lips, two blushing 
                         pilgrims, ready stand, To smooth 
                         that rough touch with a tender kiss."

               Merrick, embarrassed by these last words, starts to close 
               the book.

               Mrs. Kendal knows Juliet's lines by heart. She looks at 
               Merrick for a moment, then replies tenderly.

                                     KENDAL
                         Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand 
                         too much, Which mannerly devotion 
                         shows in this; For saints have hands 
                         that pilgrims hands do touch, And 
                         palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss.

               Merrick pauses, looking at Kendal, then continues.

                                     MERRICK
                         Have not saints lips, and holy palmers 
                         too?

                                     KENDAL
                         Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use 
                         in prayer.

                                     MERRICK
                         O, then, dear saint, let lips do 
                         what hands do. They pray, grant thou, 
                         lest faith turn to despair.

               They both look at each other for a long, silent moment. Treves 
               is touched and amazed.

                                     KENDAL
                         Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an 
                         Elephant Man at all...

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh no?

                                     KENDAL
                         Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE PEACOCK - WHITECHAPEL

               People are happily drinking and singing and laughing. Bytes 
               and the boy are keeping a watchful eye on the Night Porter, 
               who is making a deal with a couple of men at a table. They 
               hand over a few coins and follow the Night Porter out of the 
               pub. Bytes finishes his beer and thumps the glass down on 
               the bar. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve and he and the 
               boy casually follow the other three men out.

               Bytes and the boy stand by the pub door, watching the men 
               cross the street and go to the back gate of the hospital 
               which the Night Porter unlocks, and leaves unlocked, but 
               closed, behind them. They walk into Bedstead Square, laughing 
               quietly.

               Bytes crosses the street and goes to the gate. He walks along 
               the iron fence and watches the Night Porter and his 
               "customers". He stops and waits to see where they go.

               The Night Porter stands the two men before a window and 
               motions for them to wait. He goes through a door into the 
               hospital. After a few moments the window opens wide, and 
               there, neatly framed and silhouetted, stand Merrick and the 
               Night Porter, gripping Merrick's neck. The two men outside 
               start back in shock, but stand mesmerized by what they see. 
               We hear the laughter of the Night Porter echo across the 
               empty square.

               Bytes smiles broadly and says softly to himself.

                                     BYTES
                         So, there you are, my boy, my 
                         treasure.

               A SITTING ROOM

               We see a small circle of women having tea and gossip. One of 
               their daughters, off to the side, is reading a newspaper 
               society page.

                                     GIRL
                         Mummy, listen to this!

                                     MUMMY
                         Hush, Jennifer, can't you see Mummy's 
                         talking?

                                     GIRL
                         But it's about Mrs. Kendal, mummy! 
                         The actress you go on so much about!

               She has got the women's attention.

                                     GIRL
                         "Mrs. Kendal, always at the forefront 
                         of fashion and form, was seen leaving 
                         The London the other afternoon. No, 
                         dear readers, the most facile actress 
                         of our day has not been taken ill, 
                         but rather said she was 'visiting a 
                         friend'. And who was the lucky 
                         recipient of this attention? Quick 
                         enquiries proved it to be none other 
                         than Mr. John Merrick, The Elephant 
                         Man, with whom our readers are 
                         undoubtedly familiar. After a chat 
                         of three-quarters of an hour, Mrs. 
                         Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. 
                         Merrick with an autographed portrait 
                         of herself. Owing to a disfigurement 
                         of the most extreme nature, Mr. 
                         Merrick has never been properly 
                         presented to London society. But 
                         knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal 
                         goes, others inevitably follow, the 
                         questions arises: Will London society 
                         present itself to him?"

               LONDON HOSPITAL GATE

               A carriage draws up in the street outside the hospital. A 
               nicely dressed woman sticks her head out the window, looks 
               around and scowls disappointedly.

               Nearby is parked another carriage and driver.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to her driver)
                         Parkins, whose carriage is that?

                                     DRIVER
                         Well mum, that looks like Alexander, 
                         Lord Waddington's driver.

                                     WOMAN
                         Lord and Lady Waddington! Well. Drive 
                         back to the house.
                              (indicating her 
                              clothing)
                         I can't be seen in this.

               They drive off.

               Above Merrick's bookshelf we see a row of framed pictures of 
               prettily smiling society women. Mrs. Kendal has started a 
               fad. We pan slowly by them and down to Merrick's table where 
               his Mother and Mrs. Kendal have their place of honor. The 
               cathedral is also there. Beside it is a modest tea service.

               We now see a GENTLEMAN standing behind a seated LADY. They 
               hold teacups.

               They are both very attractive and empty-headed, and seem on 
               the verge of screaming. They smile at Merrick who has been 
               talking the whole while.

               Merrick holds an elegant, silvertipped walking stick across 
               his lap, and admires a ring that only fits his little finger.

                                     MERRICK
                         Thank you for your kind gifts. I 
                         can't say enough about this ring. 
                         And this walking stick is ever so 
                         dashing. So much more elegant than 
                         my old one. More tea?

               The Lady and Gentleman nod nervously. John takes the teapot 
               from the service and refills their cups. The Lady's hand 
               shakes, rattling the cup against the saucer.

                                     MERRICK
                         If you have a chill I can close the 
                         window.

                                     THE LADY
                         Oh no, no, no, I'm fine. Please... I 
                         mean, thank you.

                                     MERRICK
                         I don't get out as often as I'd like 
                         to, for some people DO find my 
                         appearance disturbing. Of course, I 
                         can't fault them.

               We see the smiling pictures.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         People are often frightened by what 
                         they don't understand.

               We see the picture of Merrick's Mother.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         And it is hard to understand, even 
                         for myself, for you see, Mother was 
                         so very beautiful.

               We draw close to his Mother's picture.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         How's your tea?

               THE RECEIVING ROOM

               Treves walks the Lord and Lady, their faces locked in terrible 
               silence, to the door. Mothershead, at her desk, watches them 
               pass with great disapproval.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                              (under her breath)
                         Watery headed bunch.

                                     TREVES
                         I regret that I must leave you here, 
                         m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much 
                         for coming. It was an act of the 
                         greatest charity.

                                     LADY WADDINGTON
                         Oh no, Mr. Treves, the pleasure was 
                         all ours. Good day.

               As they turn to go, their faces drop, their loathing 
               undisguised. Treves closes the door. He goes to Mothershead.

                                     TREVES
                         Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think 
                         John has had enough visitors for one 
                         day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture 
                         at the college, I'll be back this 
                         evening.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a 
                         word with you.

                                     TREVES
                         Oh?... Well, quickly please, 
                         Mothershead, I'm overdue.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         I can't understand why you let those 
                         people go in there, sir.

                                     TREVES
                         Now Mothershead, you have to 
                         understand that this is very good 
                         for John. He relishes contact with 
                         people outside the hospital...

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         But you saw them, sir. They couldn't 
                         hide their disgust. They don't care 
                         anything for John, they're just trying 
                         to impress their friends.

                                     TREVES
                         Aren't you being just a little harsh, 
                         Mothershead? You yourself hardly 
                         treated John with much loving kindness 
                         when he first arrived.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him 
                         and cleaned up after him! If loving 
                         kindness can be called care and 
                         practical concern, then yes, I did 
                         treat him with loving kindness, and 
                         I'm not ashamed to say it.

                                     TREVES
                         You're right, Mothershead, please 
                         forgive me... Of course, I appreciate 
                         everything you've done for John, and 
                         I'm glad that you are concerned about 
                         his welfare. But, I'm the physician 
                         in charge and I must do what I think 
                         best. I'm also very late, so please 
                         forgive me.

               He starts to go. Mothershead steps in front of him, detaining 
               him.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         If you ask me, sir, he's just being 
                         stared at all over again.

               MERRICK'S ROOM

               We pan across Merrick's bookcase, now quite full, and we see 
               a few titles: "Moll Flanders", "Emma', "Jane Eyre", "Pamela", 
               and then to Merrick. He and Treves are reading poetry 
               together.

                                     MERRICK
                         When will the stream be aweary of 
                         flowing under my eye?
                         When will the wind be aweary of 
                         blowing over the sky?
                         When will the clouds be aweary of 
                         fleeting?
                         When will the heart be aweary of 
                         beating, and nature die?

                                     TREVES
                         Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. 
                         the stream flows the wind blows the 
                         heart beats Nothing will die.

               Merrick closes his book and sits silently for a moment.

                                     MERRICK
                         Mr. Treves, there is something I've 
                         been meaning to ask you for some 
                         time...

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, John?

                                     MERRICK
                         ...Can you cure me?

               Treves is taken aback. He considers, then says tentatively.

                                     TREVES
                         No John, I can't. I can care for 
                         you, but I can't cure you.

                                     MERRICK
                         I thought as much.

               Merrick rises. Treves ponders over what Merrick has just 
               said. He looks at Merrick and something very odd happens. 
               Merrick is looking levelly at him.

               For the first and only time, we see expression on his face. 
               It is a calm, knowing look, almost a benign smile. At that 
               very moment there is a bright flash of light behind Merrick's 
               head, seemingly from the window. Treves blinks, unable to 
               comprehend what has just happened. When he looks again, the 
               moment has passed. Merrick, his back to Treves, moves to the 
               bookcase to replace the volume.

                                     TREVES
                         John...?

               There's a knock at the door.

                                     MERRICK
                         Come in.

               Nora enters with a brown paper parcel tied with string. 
               Merrick says nothing.

                                     TREVES
                         Are you looking for me, Sister?

                                     NORA
                         No sir, Mr. Merrick.
                              (to Merrick)
                         I have something for you.

               She puts the parcel on the table and opens it. We see several 
               squares of new cardboard, a cutting knife, a pastepot, and a 
               few brushes and some paint.

                                     NORA
                         I thought these things would be 
                         helpful with your cathedral.

               Merrick examines the materials with reverence, and thanks 
               her profusely.

               Treves is moved and a little disconcerted. Merrick lays the 
               things aside carefully and begins to pull the crude spires 
               from the discarded box. Nora smiles at the busy Merrick and 
               exits.

                                     TREVES
                         The cathedral is coming along nicely.

                                     MERRICK
                              (bending over the 
                              model)
                         Yes, soon I will start the main spire, 
                         but I must finish these columns first, 
                         How kind of her!

               Treves notices to his dismay that the growths on Merrick's 
               head are larger.

               He finds it very difficult to disguise his concern.

                                     TREVES
                         How blind of me. Is there anything 
                         else, John, anything at all that I 
                         could get for you?

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh no! There is nothing! I have 
                         everything, you have given me 
                         everything I could possibly want. I 
                         am happy every hour of the day. I 
                         only wish there was something I could 
                         give to you.

                                     TREVES
                         Please John, it would give me so 
                         much pleasure to give you something. 
                         Something just for yourself. Isn't 
                         there something you would like to 
                         have?

               Merrick is silent. He goes over to his cloak, reaches into 
               it and pulls out a folded up advertisement. He hands it to 
               Treves, who examines it closely. It is an advertisement for 
               an-elegant gentleman's dressing bag, boasting ivory brushes, 
               silver fittings and Moroccan silk lining.

                                     TREVES
                         You want a dressing bag, John?

                                     MERRICK
                         You don't think it's too gaudy, do 
                         you?

               HALLWAY

               Mrs. Mothershead finds Treves walking slowly down the hall, 
               looking at the ad.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Mr. Treves, some more books arrived 
                         for Mr. Merrick.

                                     TREVES
                         Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter 
                         put them in my office.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Yes sir.
                              (seeing the ad)
                         What's that?

                                     TREVES
                         A dressing bag.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Very smart indeed.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes. John wants it.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         A dressing bag?

                                     TREVES
                         You don't think it's too gaudy, do 
                         you.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Well...

                                     TREVES
                         John thinks it's very dashing. 
                         Something no gentleman should be 
                         without. I'm inclined to agree.

               He walks off.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         A dressing bag?

               MERRICK'S ROOM (DUSK)

               Merrick is still at his cathedral working away. Suddenly, he 
               looks up at the window and the Night Porter is standing there 
               smiling wickedly, pointing a finger at him.

                                     MERRICK
                         Night!

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               SITTING ROOM - TREVES' HOME

               Treves is standing by a table on which are two stacks of 
               books. Treves selects books from the stacks and puts them 
               into a box. Treves looks troubled. He takes one from the 
               pile and examines it. It's a copy of "Frankenstein".

                                     TREVES
                         You stay with me.

                                     ANNE
                              (calling from the 
                              next room)
                         Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.

               Getting no response, she enters.

                                     ANNE
                         More romances for John?

                                     TREVES
                              (far away)
                         Hmmm?

                                     ANNE
                         ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've 
                         been like this all evening.

                                     TREVES
                         Oh... I've just been thinking about 
                         something that man Bytes said.

                                     ANNE
                         Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched 
                         vampire say to upset you?

                                     TREVES
                         That I am very little different from 
                         him.

                                     ANNE
                         Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no 
                         Frederick, that's all wrong! John is 
                         happier and more fulfilled now than 
                         he has ever been in his entire life. 
                         And, that is completely due to you.

                                     TREVES
                         But why did I do it? What was this 
                         all for? So John Merrick could live 
                         out his last days in peace and 
                         comfort? Or so I could become famous?

                                     ANNE
                         Frederick, just what is it that you 
                         are saying?

                                     TREVES
                         ...Am I a good man or am I a bad 
                         man?

                                     ANNE
                         Oh Frederick.

               She holds him in her arms.

                                     ANNE
                         You're a good man. A very good man.

               We see from Treves' eyes that he is not reassured.

               BASEMENT - THE LONDON

               It is very dark. There is a dim red glow coming from the 
               holes in a furnace door. We hear a door open and footsteps 
               coming downstairs. A man comes into the basement carrying 
               something large and black. He approaches the furnace and 
               opens the door.

               The man is Treves. He is holding the stiff black surgeon's 
               coat of which he was once so proud. He looks at it for a 
               moment, and then stuffs it into the furnace. Inside, the 
               coat starts to smoke heavily, then bursts into flames.

               Treves watches it burn, and then closes the door.

               HALLWAY - THE LONDON HOSPITAL

               We see Carr Gomm walking down the hall to his office. 
               Broadneck appears, going the other way.

                                     CARR
                         Ahh! Broadneck! You'll no doubt be 
                         pleased to know that we've received 
                         a smashing response to my letter. 
                         It's all very heartwarming, though 
                         several letters do mention how beastly 
                         it would be to part the poor fellow 
                         from Mr. Treves and the staff, but 
                         since the committee insists...

                                     BROADNECK
                              (scowling)
                         Good day, Carr Gomm.

               Broadneck walks on. Carr Gomm goes into his office.

               CARR'S OFFICE

               Mothershead is standing by the desk looking through a small 
               stack of mail.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Is this all there is for John?

                                     CARR
                         I'm afraid so, Mrs. Mothershead. 
                         Perhaps tomorrow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HALLWAY

               We see in a pair of hands holding a buff colored envelope 
               embossed with the Royal Seal. We follow the hands down the 
               hall to a door where one of the hands knocks next to the 
               "F.C. Carr Gomm" sign, then enters the office.

               CARR'S OFFICE

               Carr Gomm and Mothershead look up to see a porter with the 
               buff envelope enter. Carr Gomm takes the letter and the porter 
               exits. Carr Gomm opens the letter and reads, his expression 
               changing from concern to delight.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         What is it? What is it?

               Carr Gomm hands her the letter. Never having touched Royal 
               stationary before, Mothershead handles it delicately. She 
               begins to read.

               COMMITTEE ROOM - THE LONDON

               Broadneck and the other committee members are seated at their 
               table, anxious to get the meeting underway. They talk among 
               themselves.

               The door opens and Carr Gomm and Treves enter. Treves seems 
               quite nervous, but Carr Gomm is relaxed and smiling.

                                     TREVES
                         Don't you think this is a bit 
                         premature? We don't have the backing 
                         yet to...

                                     CARR
                         Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.

               Treves sits and Carr Gomm takes his place at the head of the 
               table and raps his gavel.

                                     CARR
                         Gentlemen, I know we begin every 
                         meeting by reading the minutes, but 
                         in the interest of speed I think we 
                         should conclude a matter discussed 
                         previously, to wit, that of Mr. John 
                         Merrick, the Elephant Man...

               Broadneck explodes to his feet. Carr Gomm smiles at Treves, 
               who looks quite grim.

                                     CARR
                         Mr. Broadneck?

                                     BROADNECK
                         Mr. Chairman! I was under the distinct 
                         impression that we had concluded 
                         discussion of this disagreeable 
                         matter. Had we not ascertained that 
                         an Elephant Man is not acceptable as 
                         a patient? Have we not, very 
                         generously, allowed the creature to 
                         use two of our rooms until such time 
                         as he could be properly disposed of? 
                         Have we not...

               CUT TO MERRICK'S ROOM

               Merrick is working on his cathedral, painting details with a 
               very fine brush.

               As he lifts the brush from the paint jar, a drop falls on 
               the table. Merrick carefully lays down the brush and wipes 
               up the spilled paint with a cloth.

                                     MERRICK
                         I must be more careful!

               CUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM

                                     BROADNECK
                         Which brings to mind my next point. 
                         The rules, gentlemen, the rules. In 
                         a society such as ours, it is of 
                         paramount importance that we not 
                         stray from the established order. 
                         Has that order not already been 
                         fearfully strained by allowing this... 
                         this... sideshow exhibit to take up 
                         residence, however temporary, in two 
                         very useful rooms, the purpose of 
                         which would be far better served in 
                         accommodating treatable patients, 
                         patients to whom this hospital was 
                         originally dedicated? I believe we 
                         have a duty...

               Carr Gomm still smiles. Treves is about to spring to Merrick's 
               defense, but Carr Gomm catches his eyes and motions for him 
               to remain silent. Treves is perplexed. Carr Gomm checks his 
               pocket watch.

               CUT TO MERRICK'S ROOM

               Merrick as before, busily working away. We see a ladybug 
               crawling slowly across the roof of the cathedral. Merrick 
               notices it and watches for a moment, then reaches up and 
               lays a finger alongside the bug. The bug crawls onto his 
               finger and Merrick holds it closer to him.

                                     MERRICK
                         ...Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home... 
                         it's cloudy out, I know, but remember; 
                         behind the clouds there is always 
                         the sun.

               CUT TO WHITECHAPEL ROAD

               We see a Royal carriage glide to a stop in front of the 
               hospital. A footman jumps down and opens the door. A very 
               elegantly dressed woman begins to emerge.

               CUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM

               Broadneck is still talking.

                                     BROADNECK
                         ...In light of these facts, our course 
                         is clear. The question is not whether 
                         to accept this creature as a patient, 
                         the question is when will those rooms 
                         be vacated for use by better 
                         qualified, more deserving cases? I 
                         move that this Elephant Man be removed 
                         from the premises immediately. We 
                         have a sacred duty to cure the sick, 
                         not care for circus animals. That is 
                         my last word on the subject. Mr. 
                         Chairman, shall we vote?

               Broadneck turns to Carr Gomm. Carr Gomm checks his watch and 
               clears his throat.

                                     CARR GOMM
                         I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your 
                         mind is fixed on this matter?

               Broadneck blusters with rage.

                                     BROADNECK
                         Mr. Chairman! Don't you have ears? I 
                         am unalterably opposed to any...

               Carr Gomm smiles and again checks his watch. Treves is very 
               nervous.

               CUT TO HALLWAY

               We see two nurses, their backs to us, walking down the hall. 
               They start to go in a doorway when they stop suddenly, very 
               startled, and curtsey deeply.

               Mothershead comes into the hall, also curtseying madly. She 
               is followed by the elegantly dressed woman, who is followed 
               in turn by two footmen. They walk regally down the hall.

               CUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM

                                     BROADNECK
                         ...No, my mind is made up on this, 
                         and I am resolved to stand firm. You 
                         shall not sway me. May we now vote, 
                         Mr. Chairman, at long last?

               Carr Gomm checks his watch. The door to the room begins to 
               open. He smiles.

                                     CARR
                         Yes, I believe that time has come.

               The two footmen enter the room.

                                     1ST FOOTMAN
                         Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness 
                         Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

               The elegantly dressed woman enters. Everyone rises.

                                     ALIX
                         Good morning, gentlemen. I hope I am 
                         not interrupting?

                                     CARR
                         Indeed not, your Highness. Your 
                         presence is always greatly 
                         appreciated. We were just about to 
                         put the matter of Mr. Merrick to a 
                         vote.
                              (he turns to the other 
                              committee members)
                         The Princess is very interested in 
                         Mr. Merrick's fate.

                                     ALIX
                         Indeed I am sir, as is the Queen.
                         I have a brief communication from 
                         her Highness which she has requested 
                         I read to you: To the Governing 
                         Committee, London Hospital. I would 
                         very much like to commend you for 
                         the charitable face you have shown 
                         Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man. 
                         It is laudable that you have provided 
                         one of England's most unfortunate 
                         sons with a safe and tranquil harbour, 
                         a home. For this immeasurable 
                         kindness, as well as the many other 
                         acts of mercy on behalf of the poor, 
                         of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me 
                         informed, I gratefully thank you. 
                         Signed Victoria, Empress of India, 
                         Queen of the United Kingdom of Great 
                         Britain and Ireland.
                              (looking straight at 
                              Broadneck)
                         I am sure you gentlemen may be counted 
                         on to do the Christian thing.

               Alix seats herself.

                                     CARR
                         Thank you very much, your Highness, 
                         you may be sure we shall.

               Broadneck seems very unnerved.

                                     CARR
                         Well then, I move that Mr. John 
                         Merrick be admitted to the London 
                         Hospital on a permanent basis, on 
                         condition that the Hospital shall 
                         receive a yearly payment equal to 
                         the cost of occupying one bed, and 
                         that the funds for his care shall be 
                         clearly separate from hospital funds. 
                         All those in favor.

               Carr Gomm raises his hand. The other members, puzzled, look 
               at Broadneck.

               Quite red in the face, Broadneck looks at Carr Gomm, then to 
               Treves, then to the Princess. He seems to almost deflate, 
               then slowly raises his hand. The other members, now thoroughly 
               confused, raise their hands as well. Carr Gomm bangs his 
               gavel, smiling broadly. Treves is almost beside himself with 
               happiness, and the Princess is obviously very pleased.

                                     CARR
                         The motion is carried.

               Broadneck, humiliated, cannot look at anyone.

                                     CARR
                         Well, now we may go about our normal 
                         business.

               MERRICK'S ROOM

               Merrick is working on his cathedral. It is almost finished. 
               He is detailing the spire, carefully painting in the 
               stonework. There is a knock at the door.

                                     MERRICK
                         Please, come in.

               Treves enters carrying a wrapped parcel, followed by Carr 
               Gomm, and Mothershead.

                                     TREVES
                              (smiling broadly)
                         Good afternoon, John, Mr. Carr Gomm 
                         has something he would like to say 
                         to you.

               Treves defers to Carr Gomm.

                                     CARR
                         Mr. Merrick, it is my great pleasure 
                         to welcome you, officially to The 
                         London Hospital. The Governing 
                         Committee this morning voted 
                         unanimously to provide you these 
                         rooms on a permanent basis. This is 
                         your home now. I'm so very, very 
                         pleased for you.

               Merrick is speechless. He just looks from Treves to Carr 
               Gomm to Mothershead.

                                     TREVES
                         So you see, John, there's no need 
                         for a lighthouse. All your friends 
                         are here.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Welcome home, John.

               Merrick finds it very difficult to speak.

                                     MERRICK
                         ...my... home?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, John.

                                     MERRICK
                         You did this for me?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes.

                                     MERRICK
                         Please... please thank the governing 
                         committee for me. I will do my utmost 
                         to merit their kindness.

               Merrick looks about him at his rooms. It's beginning to dawn 
               on him that this is indeed his, that at last he has a real 
               home, a place of his own.

                                     MERRICK
                              (trying the words on 
                              for size)
                         My home.

                                     TREVES
                         There is one more thing, John. Here.

               Treves hands Merrick the package. Merrick carefully pulls 
               off the wrapping paper. Treves smiles. It's the dressing 
               bag. Merrick is overjoyed with the gift. He lovingly handles 
               the articles, taking them in and out of their compartments 
               opening and closing the bag.

                                     TREVES
                         Is it the one you wanted?

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.

                                     TREVES
                         Are you sure? Because I can take it 
                         back.

                                     MERRICK
                         Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.

               NIGHT TIME SKY

               Clouds billowing, moving swiftly.

               MERRICK'S ROOM

               Merrick is alone, wearing his cloak and standing by the table, 
               cradling the dressing bag. He takes each article out of the 
               bag and lays it carefully on the table, all in very neat 
               order. He stares at the elegant objects, then rearranges 
               them.

               Merrick picks up the toothbrush, examining it with a sort of 
               reverence. He does the same with the ivory-handled razors 
               and the comb.

               THE PEACOCK - WHITECHAPEL

               There's a good crowd in tonight; lots of drinking and shouting 
               and glasses breaking. Several of the neighborhood "working 
               girls" are having a bit of a rest, looking for a laugh. The 
               Night Porter is rounding up customers, his pockets ringing 
               with coins. People have their hands raised urging the Night 
               Porter to take them along to see The Elephant Man. The Night 
               Porter goes to a table where a MAN sits with two of the girls.

                                     MAN
                         Here now, these lovely ladies ain't 
                         never seen it!

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                              (to Man)
                         You're on mate.
                              (to all the others)
                         Alright, alright, that's enough for 
                         this performance.

               The others all moan their disappointment.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Hang on, hang on, there's always 
                         tomorrow night. Not to worry.

               Bytes, sitting at his usual place at the bar, sees that 
               tonight is his chance.

               The Night Porter rounds up his "customers", all twelve of 
               them. Bytes saunters over to the Night Porter.

                                     BYTES
                         Room for one more?

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         At the right price...

               Bytes drops several coins in the Night Porter's hand.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         There's room.

                                     BYTES
                         Well, let's be off then.

               The whole group happily leaves the pub, several still holding 
               their gin bottles. The Ladies are rather unsteady on their 
               feet. As they all leave, the Night Porter says:

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Quietly now! Quietly! We don't want 
                         to scare him.
                              (he laughs)

               MERRICK'S ROOM

               (Merrick as before) he reaches over to the picture of Mrs. 
               Kendal and picks it up. We see his face reflected in the 
               glass. Merrick sets the picture down on the table. He takes 
               up one of the silver brushes and, using the picture as a 
               mirror, neatly brushes his hair over his monstrous skull. He 
               lays the brush down in its specific spot.

               Merrick takes his ring and puts it on his left hand. He opens 
               the cigarette case and stuffs one into his right hand. He 
               takes up his walking stick, breathes deeply, then walks around 
               the room in a slow circle. Merrick is transforming himself. 
               Merrick comes back to the table and examines his reflection 
               in the picture. With the ring, the stick, the cigarette and 
               his neatly brushed hair, Merrick is the very image of a 
               dashing young man about town. He inclines his head to the 
               picture.

                                     MERRICK
                         Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am 
                         very, VERY pleased to meet you!

               At this moment the door bursts open. The Night Porter stands 
               grinning.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Curtain time!!!

               Merrick is frozen, caught. Seeing Merrick in his outfit, the 
               Night Porter's jaw drops. They both stare at each other. The 
               Night Porter begins to laugh hysterically. Merrick frantically 
               begins to put away his dressing bag articles. When Merrick 
               starts taking off his ring, the Night Porter comes over to 
               him and grabs him by the cloak.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         No, no! You look lovely. Don't change 
                         a thing, darling. You look like the 
                         bleedin' Prince of Wales.

               The Night Porter drags him by the neck to the window. He 
               throws the window open out in the square is the waiting 
               audience.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         My friends... The Elephant Man!

               He strips off Merrick's cloak. The audience gasps. A few 
               people who have been before laugh and clap.

                                     MAN (W/THE WHORES)
                              (laughing and clapping)
                         Horrible... I told you it was 
                         horrible... just horrible.

               He starts kissing each whore. The crowd is mesmerized. Bytes 
               moves in behind the Man with the Whores.

                                     BYTES
                              (to Man)
                         Perhaps the ladies would like a closer 
                         look?

               The Man begins to laugh. The Whores laugh drunkenly and 
               halfheartedly resist being taken in to see The Elephant Man. 
               As they are pushed through the door,

                                     WHORES
                         Come on Jack... No... No, don't.
                              (laughter)
                         Etc.

               The Whores reluctantly enter the room. The Night Porter laughs 
               at their discomfort. The Man notices all of Merrick's pictures 
               of women.

                                     MAN
                         'Cor, he's a real ladies' man, come 
                         on... give the ladies' man a kiss.

               He lets one of the whores go and grabs the other one from 
               behind at the wrists.

                                     MAN
                         Come on, you'll give him a kiss.

                                     WHORE
                              (still laughing but a 
                              trifle scared)
                         Come on, Jack.

               The Night Porter has turned Merrick and is holding him for 
               the approaching kiss. The crowd is egging them on. The man 
               forces the Woman closer and closer and raises her arms to 
               force her into an embrace. As Merrick and the Woman touch, 
               being pressed together, the Woman begins to scream. The Night 
               Porter, the Man and the crowd all laugh with glee. Merrick 
               and the whore now have their faces pressed together. The 
               Whore is screaming and Merrick is crying out and screaming 
               too.

                                     MAN
                         Here that's enough romance. Now into 
                         bed.

               Merrick and the Whore are pushed onto Merrick's bed. The 
               Night Porter grabs the other Whore now. She begins screaming 
               wildly.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         A prince needs a harem!

               He pushes the screaming Whore down onto Merrick. Her screaming 
               face goes right into his. Merrick tries to move away and as 
               he does his head goes too far back and his cried turn to 
               horrible wheezing.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Mind his head... You'll kill him.

               The crowd outside is trying to see in the window. Five or 
               six more have gone into Merrick's room to see. All are 
               laughing and screaming and trying to get a close look at The 
               Elephant Man.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                              (yelling)
                         Quiet down. Quiet down. You'll have 
                         the whole place down on us.

                                     BYTES
                              (outside, yelling 
                              loudly)
                         Bring him out then, so's we all can 
                         see him.

               Merrick recognizes his voice and looks frantically around 
               for his former owner. The Night Porter pulls Merrick up by 
               the window again. He then begins pushing the crowd out the 
               door.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Everyone outside!!!

               Suddenly one of the crowd outside reaches up and grabs 
               Merrick's good hand and pulls him half out the window. Others 
               follow suit and haul him all the way through. The cathedral 
               falls to the floor, breaking into several pieces.

               Because of the horror of touching him, the crowd outside 
               lets Merrick fall to the ground.

               The Night Porter whirls around and sees that Merrick is gone. 
               He pushes the rest of the people outside and quickly goes to 
               Merrick, lifting him to his feet.

               Unseen by anyone, Bytes slips into Merrick's room. Merrick 
               is now standing.

               The crowd moves in. The Night Porter is enjoying the 
               festivities, but looks around nervously for trouble.

                                     ONE MAN
                         Give 'im a drink.

               The Man grabs Merrick and pours some gin into his mouth, 
               then pushes him away.

               He's caught by another man, fed liquor and pushed away. He's 
               pushed now from person to person faster and faster. Finally 
               Merrick falls to the ground, dizzy and a bottle of gin on 
               Merrick's head. He coughs and moans through the wheezing. 
               The crowd is now strangely silent circling The Elephant Man 
               like a pack of dogs closing in on a terrified rabbit. Suddenly 
               Merrick starts to wail. The crowd joins in and they hoist 
               him above their heads, screaming with laughter, around and 
               around, joining him all the while.

               Now we see a window reflecting the scene of terror. A curtain 
               is pulled aside and we see through the reflection the face 
               of the Young Porter, watching everything.

                                     NIGHT PORTER (V.O. THE REFLECTION)
                         Here now... Here now... He's had 
                         enough... show's over!

               Merrick is lowered down into the crowd. it parts and the 
               Night Porter emerges walking Merrick toward us to his room.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                              (to the crowd behind 
                              him)
                         Meet you at the Peacock.

                                     ONE OF THE CROWD
                         Bring your friend.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                              (laughs drunkenly)
                         He's had 'is fill for one night.

               The crowd moves through the iron gate of Bedstead Square. In 
               the background we see Bytes' boy sitting on top of a wagon. 
               The Night Porter takes Merrick into his room and puts him on 
               the bed. He drunkenly stumbles about trying to out the room 
               in order. He places the smashed hulk of the cathedral back 
               up on its table, inadvertently leaving the spire and a few 
               columns on the floor. He picks the cloak up and replaces it 
               on the peg.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                              (to Merrick)
                         I did real well tonight.

               He takes a purse full of coins out of his pocket. He removes 
               one small coin and flips it on the floor in front of Merrick.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Here... buy yourself a sweet.

               The Night Porter turns and leaves.

               Merrick, alone now, hears the Night Porter's echoing footsteps 
               and the distant sound of the gate being closed. There is a 
               long silence as Merrick collects himself. He then leans back 
               into his pillows with a deep sigh. His eyes close.

                                     BYTES (V.O.)
                         My treasure...

               Merrick's eyes flash open. We see Bytes coming toward him.

                                     BYTES
                         Aren't you glad to see me?

                                     MERRICK
                         Bytes!

               Bytes lifts Merrick up off the bed. He reaches out for 
               Merrick's cloak. We slowly PAN over all the smiling women's 
               faces as we hear the following:

                                     BYTES (V.O.)
                         Get into your cloak...
                              (rustling sound)
                         ...now, your hood... do it!

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         ...Alright.

               Rustling sound. We now glide slowly on to Merrick's Mother's 
               picture.

                                     BYTES (V.O.)
                         Let's go.

               Merrick's good hand comes into the frame trying to reach his 
               mother's picture.

               He grabs at the table cloth and pulls.

               Now we see Bytes gripping Merrick's arm and pulling. We see 
               the picture fall to the ground with a THUD.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               In the sky the heavy clouds are moving.

                                                                       CUT:

               MERRICK'S ROOM (MORNING)

               Morning sunlight on the floor of Merrick's room. We move 
               slowly around, discovering the church spire, the columns, 
               the penny and Merrick's mother's picture.

               Over this, the sound of knocking on the door. Through the 
               door, we hear Treves calling, "John?... John?" More knocking. 
               The door opens.

                                     TREVES
                         John?

               Treves surveys the empty room. Quickly he goes into the side 
               bathroom. He comes out with a very worried face. He goes to 
               the cathedral model and is horrified by its condition. He 
               finds the spire and then Merrick's Mother's picture. He 
               quickly leaves the room and walks down the hall. The Young 
               Porter, waiting in the hall, approaches Treves and stops 
               him.

                                     YOUNG PORTER
                         Mr. Treves?

               Now we see Mrs. Mothershead entering Merrick's room surveying 
               the same scene.

               Her face hardens as she sees the picture of Merrick's Mother.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Good God... John?

               Now we see Treves filled with anger. He's got the information 
               from the Young Porter and bolts down the hall at full speed.

               Mothershead, still in Merrick's room, now become activated 
               with determination to get to the bottom of all this herself. 
               She leaves the room. In the distance is Treves marching off. 
               Closer to her is the Young Porter, looking worried. She calls 
               him to her.

               CLOSE-UP of Treves angrily walking.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Mothershead leaves the Young Porter, furiously marching off 
               in the same direction as Treves.

               OPERATING THEATRE

               The Night Porter is adding fresh coal to the operating room 
               stove. The old coals were still quite hot and now smoke begins 
               to rise. The Night Porter takes up the bellows and begins to 
               pump the coals into a blaze.

               The door bangs open and Treves is there, standing stock still, 
               in a cold murderous rage.

                                     TREVES
                         WHERE IS HE?

               The Night Porter, frightened by Treves' intensity, begins to 
               sputter.

                                     TREVES
                         WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         I... I don't know what you mean, 
                         Sir.

               Treves stalks over to him.

                                     TREVES
                         Don't lie to me. I know all about 
                         it. You were SEEN. Where did you 
                         take him?

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Take him? Now wait... I didn't take 
                         him anywhere. We were just having 
                         some fun. We didn't hurt him... just 
                         having a laugh, that's all.

                                     TREVES
                         HE'S GONE!

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         When I left him, he was in his bed, 
                         safe and sound.

                                     TREVES
                         YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU 
                         TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is 
                         HE?

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                              (enraged)
                         YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't 
                         done nothing wrong. People pay to 
                         see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just 
                         take the money.

                                     TREVES
                         YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! 
                         GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!

               Treves takes the Night Porter by the arm and begins to drag 
               him out. The Night Porter throws his hand off violently, 
               whirls around, his back to the door, and seizes the poker 
               from the stove.

                                     NIGHT PORTER
                         Have a care, Mr. Treves. I ain't 
                         afraid of you! You and your bleedin' 
                         Elephant Man! I'm glad what I did! 
                         And you can't do nothing! Only 
                         Mothershead can sack me.

               Treves, blind with fury, tears the poker from the Night 
               Porter's hand, and is on the verge of using it. Unbeknownst 
               to them, Mothershead has storm into the room, just in time 
               to hear the last of the Night Porter's speech. Without a 
               break, she strides over to him and with a lightning movement, 
               boxes him soundly on the ears. The blow is staggering and 
               makes quite a formidable sound. The Night Porter falls to 
               the floor, barely conscious.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         Done.

               OUTSIDE THE SHOP (DAY)

               Treves is standing in the street looking at the now bare 
               shop front. He walks to the window and tries to clean a small 
               circle in the glass. He peers in.

               From inside, through the smeared dirty window, we see Treves' 
               distorted face.

                                     CARR (V.O. THROUGHOUT)
                         I'd like to think I felt no less for 
                         John than you, Treves, but face the 
                         facts, the man has disappeared, very 
                         likely to the continent. There's no 
                         question of your going after him, 
                         you're desperately needed here by 
                         your patients. Remember Treves, you 
                         did everything in your power... 
                         everything in your power.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               INSIDE A WAGON

               A moving circle of light in blackness.

               As we move closer to the light, it becomes distinguishable 
               as a peephole in the side of a wagon. Through the peephole 
               we see a dark overcast sky. It is dusk. We move even closer 
               to the hole. Just beside it we see the head of a horse with 
               blinders on moving alongside. We move closer still to see 
               its rider, a policeman. He notices the peephole and leans 
               forward in the saddle, looking in.

               From outside, we see the peephole and an eye gazing out. The 
               eye is replaced by a plug.

               The policeman starts back and pulls up on the reins. As he 
               falls behind we see the portrait of the E.M., from the front 
               of the shop in London, on the back of the wagon. The policeman 
               looks at the poster. The wagon moves on out of frame and the 
               policeman slows his horse to a stop.

               The wagon is being driven by Bytes. The boy sits beside him. 
               Another policeman rides abreast of him. They ride a few yards 
               more and then the policeman stops by a sign at the fork of 
               the road, reading "AALST 30 km". "Brussells 80 km." The 
               policeman gestures for Bytes to move on. The wagon continues 
               down the road.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bytes and the boy are riding along the road. Bytes turns in 
               his seat and opens a hatch in the roof. He looks down in.

               Inside the wagon, lit by the last dregs of the sunset, is 
               Merrick, huddled in his sleeping posture. He feels the light 
               and looks up weakly, wheezing, obviously very sick. A small 
               bowl of potatoes sets untouched beside him.

                                     BYTES
                         Still haven't eaten, eh?

                                     MERRICK
                         Bytes... please!

                                     BYTES
                         Eat, my treasure, I want you healthy.

               He snaps the hatch shut and turns forward muttering to 
               himself.

                                     BYTES
                         I'm beginning to feel your weight.

               FIELD & ROAD (MORNING)

               We see a field with a road in the distance, leading to it. 
               It is misty, the sun barely peeking through the rolling clouds 
               above. On the road, the wagon is plodding toward us. At the 
               bottom of the frame a FEMALE PINHEAD in a dress comes into 
               view. She is watching the wagon. A DWARF comes into view 
               beside her. She points to the wagon and she and the Dwarf 
               excitedly confer. They turn back to watch its progress and 
               the Dwarf reaches up and takes the Pinhead's hand.

               We move back slowly to reveal a ring of circus wagons in the 
               field.

               ANOTHER DWARF comes up to the two other Freaks and watches 
               the wagon. We pull back further to see a small circus. There 
               are little stalls, and cages containing two mangey lions, 
               some screeching spider monkeys and some squawking parrots. 
               The circus is abustle in the drab grey field.

               CLOSE-UP of the Pinhead jumping up and down in her excitement. 
               There is a clap of thunder.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A rainstorm over the freak show. We pass along the row of 
               freak wagons.

               These freaks truly deserve the name. They are quite different 
               from the rather domestic ones we saw in the circus in England. 
               These are not fakes. A rope cordons us off from them.

               The audience, which we see all around us, is enjoying the 
               freaks, but there is a sense of vulgarity in their gaiety. 
               They seem hard, and cold and jaded.

               We move by pinheads, a Hermaphrodite and a Legless Wonder. 
               Some Siamese Twins are playing cat's cradle. Past them runs 
               a Dwarf with a plumed hat playing a small flute. Trailing 
               behind him on a string is a small wooden ark on wheels.

               A lionfaced man is combing the hair that covers his face. A 
               Rubber Man pulls the skin of his neck up over his face. There 
               is a fairly big crowd standing around a Tall Man, 
               affectionately rubbing the Small Parasitic Twin, growing out 
               of his chest. The Barker-Owners compete with each other and 
               the occasional thunder.

               Finally we hear the patter of Bytes, telling of the horrible 
               fate of John Merrick's Mother on that African Isle so many 
               years ago. A very big crowd is listening to him. They are 
               looking at the poster at the back of the wagon, waiting 
               impatiently to see the Elephant Man.

                                     BYTES
                         ...The result is plain to see. Ladies 
                         and Gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT 
                         MAN!

               He raps twice with Merrick's silver-tipped walking stick and 
               pulls the poster up. Merrick is standing unsteadily in the 
               wagon. He is quite sick. The audience gasps and shudders. A 
               few shrieks are heard. The Elephant Man is always the Elephant 
               Man.

                                     BYTES
                         Turn around!

               Merrick slowly turns around, the audience gasping at the 
               sight of the horrible tumors. Bytes raps the walking stick 
               twice.

                                     BYTES
                         Dance!

               Merrick begins a series of awkward movements, his pained 
               version of a dance.

               Without his walking stick it is very difficult for him, but 
               he strives to do it. Some of the crowd laughs at this, others 
               shudder at the strange sight.

               Suddenly Merrick falters and comes to a stop, breathing 
               irregularly. Seeing this, Bytes goes to him and bringing the 
               stick behind Merrick, out of view of the audience, jabs him 
               savagely in the back.

                                     BYTES
                         Dance!

               Merrick groans with pain and some of the people in the first 
               row flinch back.

               Merrick begins to dance again as people throw coins onto the 
               stage, which the boy gathers and puts into a cap.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BACK OF THE WAGON - DAY

               The poster is rolled up, Merrick on the floor of the wagon 
               wheezing horribly.

               Beside him on the floor is a bowl of what looks to be slop 
               and potatoes.

               Bytes is standing at the back of the wagon looking down at 
               Merrick. He picks up the bowl and jabs it at Merrick.

                                     BYTES
                         Eat, my treasure.

               Merrick looks wearily at the bowl but makes no move to accept 
               it.

                                     BYTES
                              (angry)
                         Eat. I said eat!

               Merrick closes his eyes. This really enrages Bytes.

                                     BYTES
                         Eat, damn you. EAT! EAT!

               He jabs the bowl at Merrick, almost as if he'd shove it down 
               his throat.

                                     BYTES
                         I said EAT!!

               At this last word he throws the contents of the bowl 
               splattering in Merrick's face. He stands for a moment looking 
               down at Merrick who has lapsed into a coughing fit.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SIDE OF THE WAGON - DAY

               There is a small crowd gathered in a circle on the grass. 
               Merrick stands amidst them on a small wooden stool, Bytes 
               jabbing him from behind again.

               Merrick is making a strange moaning cry, slightly reminiscent 
               of the trumpet of an elephant. The boy is passing amongst 
               the people with a cap, collecting coins. Merrick lifts his 
               face to the sky, the sound of his own misery mingling with 
               his elephant call.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SMALL CIRCUS - NIGHT

               We see the poster of the Elephant Man. Bytes stands before 
               it saying the last of the patter.

                                     BYTES
                         The result is plain to see. Ladies 
                         and gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT 
                         MAN.

               He raps twice with the walking stick and pulls the poster 
               up.

               Merrick is now extremely sick. He almost looks as if he is 
               unable to stand.

               The audience, as always, is quite alarmed. Bytes smiles and 
               comes forward.

                                     BYTES
                         Turn around!

               Merrick looks incapable of even this simple movement, but he 
               slowly manages to turn. The crowd reacts to the horrible 
               condition of Merrick's back and head.

               Bytes satisfied that the Elephant Man is having the proper 
               effect, raps the walking stick again.

                                     BYTES
                         Dance!

               Merrick's eyes look painfully up to the heavens and he begins 
               to shuffle clumsily about the platform. Without his stick 
               this is very difficult for him, causing him great pain. It 
               is a humiliating spectacle and the crowd unimpressed by the 
               halting movements of the monster begins to heckle him.

               Bytes seeing that the dancing isn't being received well moves 
               to place a stool next to Merrick.

                                     BYTES
                              (rapping)
                         Up! Up!

               Merrick, already exhausted by his little dance, wheezes and 
               coughs, attempting to ascend the stool. It is useless, he is 
               just too tired. Again the audience shouts its disapproval, 
               booing and hissing the Elephant Man. Bytes curses and raps 
               again, demanding obedience from Merrick who again bravely 
               tries to mount the stool. He cannot do it!

               Bytes, striving to save the moment and please the angry crowd, 
               goes to Merrick and roughly helps him up. Merrick teeters 
               precariously on the stool. Bytes raps the stick.

                                     BYTES
                         Give the call of the elephant!

               Merrick hesitates and Bytes bangs the stick on the wagon. 
               The audience quiets down to hear the elephant call. Merrick 
               senses this lull, but he is very frightened and sick. He 
               lifts his head wearily and makes a few wavering cries that 
               sound very little like an elephant.

                                     BYTES
                         Louder!

               Merrick tries again but there is no improvement. The crowd 
               begins to jeer at

               Merrick, exhorting him to make the call of the elephant. 
               Merrick is now almost swaying on the stool. He attempts to 
               step down, but as he does it finally becomes too much for 
               him and he collapses into a heap on the wagon floor. The 
               crowd is no longer in the least bit challenged by this piteous 
               mess and they break out into a vocal fury, throwing objects 
               at the wagon.

               Bytes is humiliated at first, and then is quickly angry. He 
               turns to Merrick.

                                     BYTES
                         Get up you miserable bastard!

               But Merrick just lays there moaning and wheezing irregularly.

                                     BYTES
                         I SAID, GET UP!

               He jabs Merrick a few times with the silver-tipped walking-
               stick. The crowd jeers even louder still. There is a clap of 
               thunder.

                         I'm beatin' a dead horse.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               SMALL CIRCLE OF WAGONS (NIGHT)

               Bytes is seated by a campfire drinking from a bottle of wine. 
               He is very drunk. From the wagon behind him we can hear 
               Merrick coughing and wheezing.

               We also hear the boy, almost pleading with Merrick to stop 
               coughing and to try to eat. As Bytes listens he gets angrier 
               and angrier. Finally he rises clumsily to his feet and 
               stumbles over to the back of the wagon.

                                     BYTES
                         Another bleedin' heart!

               The boy is crouched over Merrick, who looks little better 
               than a corpse.

               Bytes points a menacing finger at Merrick.

                                     BYTES
                         You sly bastard. You're doing this 
                         to spite me, aren't you!

                                     BOY
                         Aw, Bytes, he's sick.

                                     BYTES
                         He's doing it to spite me, I tell 
                         you, and it's got to stop!

                                     BOY
                         He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.

                                     BYTES
                              (enraged)
                         If he does it's his own fault! But 
                         I'm not burying that swollen bag of 
                         flesh.

               He reaches in and grabs Merrick roughly by his arm, dragging 
               him out of the wagon.

                                     BOY
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BYTES
                         I'll show you! I'll show you!

               He drags Merrick across the way to a small monkey wagon. The 
               boy follows, his face filled with sympathy for Merrick. Bytes 
               opens the cage door and stuffs Merrick in as the monkeys 
               scream.

                                     BOY
                         Don't!

                                     BYTES
                         Shut up!

               He slams the door and latches it. Then he quickly turns, 
               still in his rage, and starts for the wagon. As he passes 
               the boy, the boy tries to stop him.

                                     BOY
                         Bytes, please...

               Bytes knocks the boy down with the back of his hand. He stalks 
               to his wagon and climbs inside. After some muffled sound, 
               Merrick's food bowl comes flying out. There are more muffled 
               sounds as Merrick's stick, cloak and hood are also thrown 
               out one by one.

                                     BYTES
                         Out!

               The boy looks to Merrick who is in a panic trying to keep 
               himself away from the monkeys who scream loudly in all the 
               excitement. We hear Bytes, cursing to himself, in the wagon. 
               The boy, frightened, goes to the fire and pulls a blanket 
               around him.

               Merrick crawls to one corner of the cage away from the 
               screaming monkeys.

               Suddenly one of the braver ones leaps at Merrick with a 
               scream, biting him on the arm, and moving quickly away. 
               Merrick yelps with pain and struggles to move away. The other 
               monkeys have gotten the idea now and they begin to move warily 
               toward Merrick, screeching threateningly. Another leaps out 
               and clings to Merrick's shoulder, biting and scratching 
               furiously then he too jumps away.

               Merrick cries out.

               Now the monkeys are getting braver and more and more of them 
               lash out at Merrick with their paws. They jump onto him with 
               savage screams, biting him on the head and neck and shoulders. 
               Merrick's eyes search for escape. The monkeys come on and on 
               without a break, screaming madly all the while.

               With his good hand Merrick begins to pull himself up with 
               the aid of a bar.

               The monkeys strive to pull him down. Merrick looks through 
               the bars at the wagon and screams frantically.

                                     MERRICK
                         Bytes! Bytes, please!!

               But Bytes won't come. Something is happening inside Merrick. 
               A wave of feeling is growing, coming from a place in him 
               very deep down and far away.

               This feeling seems to give him strength and he is able to 
               pull himself all the way up in spite of the hairy moving 
               mass that now seems to cling to every part of his body.

               The feeling is surging up inside Merrick making his body 
               shake uncontrollably as if he were a volcano about to erupt. 
               The monkeys keep on biting and screeching, pulling at him. 
               Suddenly a formidable cry rings out of Merrick's mouth, with 
               a power and assurance we have never heard from him before. 
               He whirls about and cries out again a shattering "No", the 
               force of which scatters most of the monkeys away from him 
               onto the cage floor, dumbfounded.

               Merrick grabs a monkey who has managed to hang and throws it 
               into the group of monkeys on the floor.

                                     MERRICK
                         NO! I AM NOT AN ELEPHANT! I AM NOT 
                         AN ANIMAL!! I AM A HUMAN BEING! I... 
                         AM... A MAN! I AM A MAN!!

               The monkeys have been shocked into silence, pushed into the 
               other end of the cage. Merrick, perhaps as surprised as the 
               monkeys, rests against the bars of the cage. The monkeys 
               make no move toward him. They sit across the cage from Merrick 
               silently watching him with fear.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SILENT FACES OF THE MONKEYS

               We now see Merrick crouched in a corner of the cage in his 
               sleeping position.

               We see the monkeys again, and hear whispering in the still 
               night. CU of merrick's head resting on his knees. The 
               whispering continues and a shadow falls across Merrick. 
               Merrick begins to stir, his head comes up, and he looks 
               around. The whispering stops.

               We pull back to see some of the freaks from the circus 
               gathered around the monkey cage in a small group. They are: 
               2 pinheads (male and female), the dwarf we saw earlier with 
               the plumed hat and the ark on a string, another male dwarf, 
               a female midget, a lion-faced man, and an armless wonder. 
               The female pinhead reaches into the cage and pats Merrick's 
               head.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         You alright?

                                     MERRICK
                         y-y-yes--

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         Want to come out?

                                     MERRICK
                         You're English.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         Of course! You want out?

                                     MERRICK
                         Yes.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         Won't be a moment.

               He looks to the lion-faced man and speaks to him in a foreign 
               tongue. The lion-faced man unlatches the cage door. Then, 
               after further instruction, from the plumed dwarf, the freaks 
               gently help Merrick out of the cage, closing the door behind 
               him. The dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion-faced 
               man and the armless wonder move to each side of Merrick. The 
               lion-faced man pulls Merrick's right arm over his shoulder. 
               Merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         We've decided... You've got to get 
                         away from here...

               He and the other dwarf light two lanterns and they begin to 
               move off.

               The boy by the wagon has awakened. He sees the small caravan 
               of freaks moving in the darkness, the light from the lanterns 
               bobbing over the grass. His first instinct is to call for 
               Bytes, which he almost does, but then he thinks better of 
               it. He rises and goes to where Bytes threw Merrick's stick 
               and disguise.

               He nicks them up and goes to the small band of strangely 
               shaped beings. They stop and watch him warily.

                                     BOY
                              (handing over the 
                              things)
                         Here... you'll need these.

               Merrick looks the boy in the eye, and the boy holds his gaze.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         Good of you, mate.

                                     BOY
                              (to Merrick)
                         Good luck.

                                     MERRICK
                         But... but...

                                     BOY
                         I'll be alright.

               The small band moves away through the wagons. The boy watches 
               the lantern light receding in the darkness. He turns and 
               looks to the wagon, the poster of the Elephant Man, and the 
               dying fire. He moves to the fire quickly collecting a few 
               blankets and belongings. Then taking one last look at the 
               garish poster just visible in the night, he runs off into 
               the darkness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               WOODS - NIGHT

               We see the beams of the lanterns moving through the trees 
               like will-o-the-wisps.

               They help Merrick along, the plumed Dwarf directing them 
               from time to time. As they move along we see them pass a 
               small still pond.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

               The intrepid freaks approach a bend in the road. They go 
               around the corner and before them stands a small train 
               station, a train sitting amongst the steam by a platform. 
               The freaks stop just outside the light of the station and 
               the plumed Dwarf's instruction get Merrick into his disguise. 
               The female pinhead, who has carried his stick, hands it to 
               Merrick, squeezing his hand.

                                     MERRICK
                         Thank you, my friends.

               The plumed Dwarf relays the message and the freaks respond 
               to Merrick in their language.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         I'll go in with you, you'll need a 
                         ticket.

               He turns and confers with the freaks who all rifle through 
               their pockets and produce some coins. Then he and Merrick 
               walk into the station, the freaks watching and waving.

               ON THE PLATFORM

               The train is about to leave. At a barrier two ticket 
               collectors are taking tickets of a few last-minute passengers, 
               who hurry off.

               The Plumed Dwarf and Merrick appear and walk to the barrier. 
               The Plumed Dwarf hands over the ticket.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         I'm just going to help my friend on 
                         board.

               They walk off down the platform. The collectors stare after 
               them.

               The Plumed Dwarf, his arm around Merrick, is helping him 
               down the platform, as fast as possible, his ark trailing 
               behind him. As they pass the windows of the first-class 
               carriages, we see the ornate interiors and the happy, handsome 
               people on their plush seats.

               The Plumed Dwarf finds an empty compartment and opens the 
               door.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         This'll do.

               He looks down the platform. The Ticket Collectors are watching 
               them with great interest.

               Merrick climbs laboriously aboard.

               The other people on board see Merrick, react, and move away 
               from him as far as they can in the cramped, 3rd class 
               carriage.

               The Plumed Dwarf notices this and sniffs at the people with 
               contempt.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         I'm sorry I could only get you a 
                         third class ticket, but it's all we 
                         had.

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh no, my friend...

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         Say hello to London for me. I miss 
                         her.

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh, yes.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         You know, I saw you once there, in 
                         London. You're a great attraction.

               He grins. The whistle blows and the train slowly begins to 
               move off. The Plumed Dwarf still holding the door open, walks 
               along with it.

                                     PLUMED DWARF
                         Luck, my friend, luck. Who needs it 
                         more than we?

               Merrick nods "yes", and holds out his hand. The train is 
               moving a little faster. The Plumed Dwarf grabs his hand and 
               they shake.

               He shuts the door. As the carriage passes, Merrick's mask is 
               pressed up against the window. The Plumed Dwarf waves to him 
               as the train moves away.

               He looks at the train for a moment, then walks back down the 
               platform.

               THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - INTERIOR

               Merrick is in the corner, facing into the carriage. He looks 
               slowly around.

               The other passengers have moved away, forming almost a moat 
               of space around him. We see the whole carriage now; the 
               cowering people and Merrick at the far end. Seeing their 
               silent, horrified stares, he moves to the opposite seat, 
               facing the back wall. Merrick looks around for a moment, 
               then sees his reflection in the window. He stares at himself.

               THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE

               The carriage is dark now, and empty except for Merrick. He 
               looks out the window at a sign above a station platform that 
               says "Oostende", and at the few people still walking about.

               OOSTENDE STATION PLATFORM (NIGHT)

               We see the side of the carriage. Merrick, inside the darkened 
               car, is not visible. A CONDUCTOR walks to the end of the 
               carriage and turns a valve. He opens the door to Merrick's 
               compartment.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         I'm sorry, you'll have to leave now.

               Merrick is motionless, reluctant to leave the security of 
               the darkness.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         This is the end of the line, you'll 
                         have to leave now.

               Merrick pulls his walking stick from the darkness and plants 
               it firmly on the floor with a loud THUD. The Conductor, 
               expecting violence, draws back. A few people on the platform, 
               who have stopped to watch this exchange, gasp.

               Merrick rises with the help of his stick, and slowly descends 
               from the carriage watched very carefully by the others. He 
               looks around for a moment, then walks off down the platform. 
               TWO YOUNG TOUGHS follow a little distance behind him, laughing 
               and mimicking his uneven gait.

               OOSTENDE QUAY (NIGHT)

               We see a short line of people waiting to board a cross-channel 
               steamer. The First-Mate is standing by the gangplank, smiling 
               at the women passengers and making the most of his handsome 
               face and crisp white uniform. He surveys the line, stops and 
               smiles even more broadly. A very pretty Young Woman at the 
               end of the line is smiling back.

               We see the end of the quay disappearing into darkness towards 
               the station.

               The rhythmic sound of Merrick's stick is heard as he slowly 
               moves into the light.

               The Woman, still smiling at the First-Mate, demurely lowers 
               her eyes. Merrick appears behind her, breathing heavily from 
               the long walk. The woman's face freezes. She turns her head, 
               ever so slightly, and sees Merrick. Her face drops.

               The First-Mate sees the Woman change, then sees Merrick. He 
               walks out of frame. Merrick is still trying to catch his 
               breath as the First-Mate walks up. The Woman looks up at the 
               First-Mate imploringly.

                                     FIRST-MATE
                         May I see your ticket?

               Merrick, confused at first, produces his ticket from his 
               cloak. The First-Mate examines it and hands it back.

                                     FIRST-MATE
                         I'm sorry, there's no room for you 
                         on this ship, you'll have to wait 
                         for the next one, in the morning.

               Merrick remains motionless.

                                     FIRST-MATE
                         You heard me. There's no room. Now 
                         be off with you.

               He points down the quay. Merrick turns and walks away. The 
               Woman smiles gratefully at the Fist-Mate, who tips his hat.

               A WAREHOUSE PIER

               TWO DRUNKS are sitting against the wall, drinking and singing. 
               One of them gets up and walks out of frame.

               Merrick peeks around a corner at the Drunk. They stare at 
               each other for a long moment. Merrick disappears. The other 
               Drunk comes back, sits down, and they both start singing 
               again.

               Merrick is in darkness, seated around the corner, tapping 
               his left hand against his leg, keeping in time with the 
               drunken music.

               OOSTENDE QUAY (MORNING)

               We see Merrick behind some crates, watching the ship. On the 
               wharf a different First-Mate waits until the last of the 
               morning passengers board the ship. He then nods to the Ticket 
               Taker and ascends the gangplank, nodding to a crew man. On 
               board, everyone prepares to get underway.

               Merrick pitches forward from behind the crates, half running, 
               half stumbling toward the Ticket Taker. The Ticket Taker, 
               about to board the ship, drops the tickets on the ground and 
               stoops to pick them up. As he collects the scattered tickets 
               a hand comes into frame holding a ticket out to him. He 
               reaches for it, and calls over his shoulder to the crewman 
               at the plank.

                                     TICKET TAKER
                         Wait! One more!

               He turns back and finally takes a look at the late arrival.

                                     TICKET TAKER
                         You'll have to hurr...

               His mouth drops. Merrick hurries past him. The crewman now 
               also sees the passenger as he begins his clumsy ascent of 
               the gangplank. The shrill ship's whistle blows.

               ON BOARD

               Merrick is crouched in a dark corner underneath a stairway, 
               his head resting on the points of both knees, his arms clasped 
               around them. He is asleep. A few drops of rain fall and hit 
               his cap, then a few more and finally it begins to rain. He 
               wakes up and looks around. He hears a voice.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                         Look! It's Dover!

               Through the stairs we see a young couple in the rain at the 
               railing, arm in arm. The Young Woman points. The Young Man 
               turns to her and smiles.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Finally! Dover!

               They laugh and hug each other and run inside out of the rain. 
               Merrick's hand comes into the shot, grasping a stair and 
               pulling himself up slowly. He rounds the stairs and walks 
               onto the deck looking after the young couple.

               Merrick walks to the railing and leans over it, oblivious of 
               the rain. We see the cliffs of Dover.

               DOCKSIDE - DOVER

               The ship's gangplank leading down to a sea of umbrellas. 
               Passengers one by one come down the plank and are swallowed 
               by the crowd. On the dock amidst the umbrellas, we see 
               Merrick. He looks around, then moves off into the crowd. The 
               crowd moves past a sign saying, "To The Trains".

               LONDON TRAIN - INTERIOR

               Through a rain-streaked window we see rolling green 
               countryside. We pull back to see an Elderly Man in a heavy 
               black overcoat with a wide-brimmed rain hat eating an apple. 
               Beside him his wife knits.

               A few other people similarly clothed are sleeping. We PAN 
               across them to see Merrick at the back of the car watching 
               the Elderly Man eat.

               LONDON TRAIN - EXTERIOR

               The last car speeds down the track and disappears.

               LIVERPOOL STREET STATION

               Grey light filters through the windows in the high canopy 
               ceiling over the trains in the station. The platforms below 
               fill with people as trains arrive and depart. We now see the 
               station with its newsstands, sweetstalls, shoeshiners, and 
               passengers moving to and fro, carrying luggage and looking 
               for their train.

               A YOUNG BOY is seated on a pile of baggage looking very adult 
               and bored. His MOTHER stands beside him, though we see only 
               a portion of her billowy skirt.

               We hear her voice in rapid conversation with another Woman. 
               The Young Boy scans the crowd looking for excitement. He 
               sees something.

               The Elderly Man we saw on the train and his wife are moving 
               past the barrier.

               The Young Boy slowly pulls a peashooter from a pocket, puts 
               a pea in his mouth, and raises the pipe to his lips. His 
               Mother's hand shoots out and grabs it.

                                     MOTHER'S VOICE
                         Little beast! I thought mummy told 
                         you not to bring that horrid thing. 
                         Can't you behave?

               She continues her conversation. The Boy looks sour. Merrick 
               is moving past the barrier. He stops to look around and plan 
               his next move. The Boy sees him. He tugs on his Mother's 
               skirt.

                                     BOY
                         Mummy! Mummy! Look at that man! His 
                         head, it's huge! Mummy, why is his 
                         head so big? Mummy? Mummy?

                                     MOTHER
                         Do be quiet Little Jim. Can't you 
                         see Mummy is speaking?

               Merrick still looking around, suddenly turns in Little Jim's 
               direction. He sees the Boy tugging at his Mother's skirt and 
               pointing at him.

               He turns and walks in the opposite direction along a wall 
               stacked with trunks and luggage, trying as best as he can to 
               blend in. Little Jim gets up and moves after him.

               Merrick continues along the wall. A few people give him a 
               second look, but pass on. Little Jim comes up alongside him.

                                     LITTLE JIM
                         Hey Mister, why is your head so big?

               Merrick turns and looks at Little Jim. He looks quickly 
               around. We see, across the station, an open archway leading 
               out into a street. Merrick moves away from Little Jim out of 
               frame. Little Jim watches him go.

                                     LITTLE JIM
                         Mister!

               Two other BOYS join Little Jim. The three of them watch the 
               escaping Merrick, then move off after him. Merrick is 
               frantically trying to make it to the archway. The three boys 
               appear behind him and call out.

                                     BOYS
                         Mister! Mister!

                                     LITTLE JIM
                         Why don't you answer me?

               One of the boys reaches down and snatches the hem of Merrick's 
               cloak. He lifts it, trying to catch a glimpse of the 
               mysterious stranger. Merrick pulls away and tries to go 
               faster. Relishing the hunt, the boys follow him, taunting 
               him all the way. As they approach the arch, Little Jim, 
               determined now, steps in front of him cutting him off.

               Merrick comes to an abrupt standstill, shrinking from the 
               boy. Little Jim reaches up to the hood and grasps it firmly.

                                     LITTLE JIM
                         Now I'll see you...

               He lifts the hood and then staggers back onto the floor in a 
               spasm of fear.

               He lets out a shrill scream. Merrick turns wildly away, 
               looking for another escape. Little Jim's Mother, hearing her 
               son's cries, looks up immediately.

               She sees Merrick and the howling boy in the middle of the 
               station.

                                     MOTHER
                         My son! My son! Help!

               Merrick, hearing this, looks in her direction and whirls 
               away. He stumbles toward another archway exit. People, hearing 
               the noise, watch him go. He knocks down a little girl in his 
               flight and she, too, starts screaming.

               Through the archway comes a bobby. Jim's Mother, now with 
               her son, calls to him.

                                     MOTHER
                         Stop that man! Stop that man!

               Merrick stops at the sight of the bobby. The bobby at the 
               arch, now aware of the commotion, sees Merrick and walks 
               quickly towards him.

               Merrick changes course, but, a group of men, alerted by Jim's 
               mother's screams, move forward together, cutting him off. 
               They yell at him angrily.

               One of them darts toward him and grabs a hold of Merrick's 
               hood. Merrick turns frantically away and as he does, the 
               hood is pulled off him. The crowd shouts at him as he goes, 
               following him in wary pursuit. He moves back past the children 
               and Jim's Mother. They all scream and shield themselves from 
               his approach. Another group of people move toward him blocking 
               all escape.

               Behind him, he sees a door to a urinal. He moves through it 
               followed by the crowd. We hear fearsome echoes inside.

               Inside the urinal, the crowd presses Merrick toward a wall. 
               They have become angry now. They shout and there is fear in 
               their voices. They hem Merrick in. He looks around hoping 
               for an opening. There is none.

               He gives a strangled cry and collapses as the bobby pushes 
               his way through the crowd.

               Merrick puts his good hand over his good ear trying to block 
               out the screams of the crowd.

                                     MERRICK
                              (quietly to himself)
                         I am not an animal... I'm not... I'm 
                         not... I am a man.

               EXAMINING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL

               A small room off the Receiving Room. In the center of the 
               room is a low sofa covered with deeply stained, shiny black 
               leather. On it lies a man, groaning softly. Treves is helping 
               a Dresser bandage the man's leg.

               Mrs. Mothershead appears at the doorway.

                                     MOTHERSHEAD
                         There's a policeman to see you, Sir.

               The bobby from the Liverpool Street Station enters.

                                     BOBBY
                         Are you Frederick Treves, sir?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes...

               The card changes hands.

               THE URINAL

               Treves enters and pushes through the crowd. He sees Merrick 
               in a heap on the floor. The SERGEANT gets up to meet him in 
               the middle of the room, but Treves keeps walking toward 
               Merrick.

                                     SERGEANT
                         You know this man, sir?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes, he's... my friend.

               Treves goes to Merrick who, just coming to, reaches out to 
               him with his good hand. Treves pulls him up, his eyes brimming 
               with tears. Merrick, too, is weeping. Treves embraces him.

                                     MERRICK
                         Mr. Treves! Treves.

                                     TREVES
                         John.... how can you ever forgive 
                         me?

               HALLWAY

               Treves, Carr Gomm and Mrs. Kendal are walking down a hallway 
               engaged in conversation.

                                     KENDAL
                         It's all arranged. I'll send over 
                         some evening gowns for the sisters 
                         that you select to accompany Mr. 
                         Merrick. You'll be using the Royal 
                         entrance and Princess Alexandra 
                         herself will be there to welcome him 
                         to her private box.

                                     TREVES
                         I'm very grateful to you, Mrs.
                         Kendal. This is just the thing to 
                         help him forget his ordeal. John 
                         will be very excited.

                                     KENDAL
                         Well it is a miracle he ever got 
                         back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, 
                         under your expert care, he'll have 
                         many happy years ahead.

                                     TREVES
                         I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the 
                         short time he was gone the size of 
                         his head has increased rapidly... as 
                         is his pain.

                                     KENDAL
                         How awful for John.

                                     TREVES
                         And yet, not once have any of us 
                         heard him complain.

                                     KENDAL
                         Is he... dying then?

                                     TREVES
                         Yes. There is nothing more 
                         frustrating, nothing that makes a 
                         physician feel more useless, than 
                         standing by watching his patient 
                         deteriorate. And when that patient 
                         is a friend, no... no, there's 
                         absolutely nothing I can do.

                                     KENDAL
                         Well, it's all quite... I've never 
                         heard... It's quite...

                                     TREVES
                              (understandingly)
                         Yes.

               MERRICK'S ROOM - MORNING

               Merrick stands before the row of smiling ladies on his wall. 
               He surveys them lovingly for a long moment. He is holding in 
               his hand a bundle of evening clothes, the handsome black bow 
               tie lying on the new silk shirt.

                                     MERRICK
                         You women are such strange and 
                         wonderful creatures... Alas, it seems 
                         to be my fate to fall in love with 
                         each and everyone of you. I especially 
                         wish you could all be with me 
                         tonight... I'm finally going to the 
                         theatre.

               He stands for a moment, reluctant to leave their company. He 
               goes to his bed placing the clothes upon it, and then to the 
               cathedral. He compares it with St. Phillips outside. He picks 
               up the main spire and gazes at it, but his mind is somewhere 
               else.

                                     MERRICK
                         ...The theatre...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THEATRE ROYAL - DRURY LANE

               We see the whole theatre. It is very ornate. The orchestra 
               is tuning up and the house is filled with elegant, well 
               dressed, handsome people all happily chatting and calling to 
               one another. We see young men and women flirting boldly and 
               generally enjoying each other's company. In the Royal Box 
               Mothershead and Nora in evening gowns sit up front relishing 
               the spectacle.

               In the back of the box John sits between Treves and the 
               Princess. He is dressed in his evening clothes, his cloak 
               tied over his shoulders like a cape, but he does not wear 
               his hood.

               The Princess is explaining to Merrick the workings of a pair 
               of opera glasses.

               He takes them and delightedly spies about the theatre.

               John is breathless as the house lights dim and the curtain 
               rises. Enter chorus.

                                     CHORUS
                         O for a Muse of fire, that would 
                         ascend 
                         The brightest heaven of invention, A 
                         kingdom for a stage, princes to act 
                         And monarchs to behold the swelling 
                         scene! Then should the warlike Harry, 
                         like himself, 
                         Assume the port of Mars; and at his 
                         heels, 
                         Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, 
                         sword and fire 
                         Crouch for employment. But pardon, 
                         gentles all, 
                         The flat unraised spirits that have 
                         dar'd 
                         On this unworthy scaffold to bring 
                         forth 
                         So great an object: can this cockpit 
                         hold 
                         The vasty fields of Rance? Or may we 
                         cram 
                         Within this wooden O the very casques 
                         That did affright the air at 
                         Agincourt? 
                         O, pardon! since a crooked figure 
                         may 
                         Attest in little place a million; 
                         And let us, ciphers to this great 
                         account, 
                         On your imaginary forces work.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Treves smiling at John. He exchanges knowing smiles with the 
               Princess. John watches with the unconstrained delight of a 
               child; but his rapture is even more intense and solemn. His 
               attitude is one of wonder and awe, and he often leans forward, 
               panting in his excitement. To John the characters are not 
               actors in make-up and costume, but real people.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Mrs. Kendal and an actor dressed as royalty doing the last 
               scene of Henry the Fifth.

                         Fair Katharine, and most fair, will 
                         you vouchsafe to teach a soldier 
                         terms 
                         Such as will enter at a lady's ear 
                         And plead his love-suit to her gentle 
                         heart?

                                     KATH
                         Your majesty shall mock at me; I 
                         cannot speak your England.

                                     K. HEN
                         O fair Katharine, if you will love 
                         me soundly with your French heart, I 
                         will be glad to hear you confess it 
                         brokenly with your English tongue. 
                         Do you like me, Kate?

                                     KATH
                         Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 
                         "like me".

                                     K. HEN
                         An angel is like you, Kate, and you 
                         are like an angel.

                                     KATH
                         O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes 
                         sont pleines de tramperies.

                                     K. HEN
                         What say you, fair one? That the 
                         tongues of men are full of deceits?

                                     KATH
                         Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be 
                         full of deceits.

                                     K. HEN
                         I know no way to mince it in love, 
                         but directly to say "I love you".
                         What! A speaker is but a prater; a 
                         rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg 
                         will fall; a straight back will stoop; 
                         a black beard will turn white; a 
                         curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair 
                         face will wither; a full eye will 
                         wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, 
                         is the sun and the moon, or rather 
                         the sun and not the moon; for it 
                         shines bright and never changes, but 
                         keeps his course truly.

               During the above, Merrick mouths the Kings lines.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Royal Box, the Princess and the two friends enjoying the 
               show.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STAGE

               The chorus steps out to give the epilogue.

                                     CHORUS
                         Thus far, with rough and allunable 
                         pen, 
                         Our bending author hath pursued the 
                         story, 
                         In little room confining mighty men, 
                         Mangling by starts the full course 
                         of their glory. 
                         Small time, but in that small most 
                         greatly liv'd 
                         This star of England: Fortune made 
                         his sword; 
                         By which the world's best garden he 
                         achiev'd.

               During the above, the CAMERA moves in on John.

               Amidst great applause the curtain rings down. Through the 
               curtain comes Mrs. Kendal to renewed applause. She motions 
               the audience to quiet down.

                                     MRS. KENDAL
                         Thank you for your warm greeting.
                         Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's 
                         performance was very special to me, 
                         because it was very special to someone 
                         else, a man who knows the theatre 
                         and loves the theatre, and yet tonight 
                         is the first time he's ever actually 
                         been here. I would like to dedicate... 
                         the whole company wishes to dedicate, 
                         from their hearts, tonight's 
                         performance to Mr. John Merrick, my 
                         dear friend.

               She gestures toward the Royal Box. There is modest applause 
               as the audience rises and turns toward it. Merrick cannot be 
               seen in the shadows, and the crowd cranes their necks trying 
               to get a glimpse of him. We hear whispers of "Oh look! It's 
               the Elephant Man! The Elephant Man!' run through the audience. 
               Treves turns to John.

                                     TREVES
                         Stand up, John. Let them see you.

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh no, I couldn't.

                                     TREVES
                         It's for you, John. It's all for 
                         you. Go ahead, let them see you.

               Merrick rises and comes forward to thunderous applause. The 
               audience begins to rise and they clap their hands even louder.

               Merrick is overcome by the applause. Tears run down his 
               cheeks. Treves, Nora, Mothershead and the Princess, filled 
               with pride, beam at John.

                                     MERRICK
                              (quietly, to Treves)
                         I feel as if I've traveled my whole 
                         life just to stand here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MERRICK'S ROOM

               Merrick, in a night-shirt, is seated at his table working on 
               his cathedral.

               Treves is nearby.

                                     MERRICK
                         Wasn't Mrs. Kendal wonderful? I can't 
                         blame the King for wanting to marry 
                         her.

               Merrick closes his eyes and his head tilts forward slightly. 
               It seems unbearably large: too large for him to support.

                                     TREVES
                         Will the cathedral be finished soon, 
                         John?

                                     MERRICK
                         Yes, very soon.

                                     TREVES
                         Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. 
                         Well, I suppose I'll be on my way 
                         now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself 
                         this evening.

                                     MERRICK
                         Oh yes! It was wonderful!

                                     TREVES
                         I'm glad, John. Goodnight.

               He turns and starts out the door.

                                     MERRICK
                         Mr. Treves?

               Treves comes back to Merrick.

                                     TREVES
                         Yes John?

                                     MERRICK
                         Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. 
                         Is it alright, did I make any mistakes 
                         that you can see?

                                     TREVES
                              (looking at the 
                              cathedral)
                         No, John, not one that I can see.

                                     MERRICK
                         Then I shouldn't change anything?

                                     TREVES
                         No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.

               The two look at each other silently.

                                     MERRICK
                         ...I'll walk you to the door.

               Merrick rises and goes with Treves to the door.

                                     TREVES
                         Goodnight John. Sleep well.

                                     MERRICK
                         You too, my friend. Goodnight.

               Treves smiles at John then walks down the darkened hallway. 
               Merrick watches him for a moment, then slowly shuts the door. 
               We hear the distant echo of Treves footsteps. Merrick goes 
               back to examine his cathedral, looking at it from different 
               angles. He picks up a fine brush, dipping it into the paint, 
               and makes a few final brush strokes.

               He moves back into the middle of the room and gazes at it 
               for a long time. He lowers the brush to his side.

                                     MERRICK
                         It is finished.

               The cathedral is a masterwork of detail and shading, as if 
               it were St. Philips itself shrunk to a miniature. He goes to 
               the table, dips the brush into the paint and carefully signs 
               his name at the base of the main spire.

                                     MERRICK
                         John... Merrick!

               He sighs deeply, lays the brush down on the table and pushes 
               the model towards the window. The movement causes him pain. 
               He puts his left hand up and feels the back of his head. 
               Merrick turns out the lamp and goes to his bed. He looks at 
               the cathedral again, then around at his room. We see in the 
               dim light his books, his gallery of smiling women, his 
               dressing bag, his cloak and hood, and finally his mother's 
               picture on the table. A slight breeze billows the curtains. 
               We move in very close to them.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               High altitude... roiling clouds with lightning flashes and 
               low thunder. The sky is in turmoil.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         When will the stream be aweary of 
                         flowing under my eye?

               Lightning flash... thunder roll. The clouds are mingling and 
               scattering.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         When will the wind be aweary of 
                         blowing over the sky?

               The clouds erupt, pushed onward and onward... they slowly 
               begin to calm as... they turn slowly into... elephants linked 
               trunk to tail moving slowly away from us...

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         When will the clouds be aweary of 
                         fleeting?

               The elephants are calmer than the skies we saw... they keep 
               moving onward and onward...

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         When will the heart be aweary of 
                         beating....

               A lacy curtain has taken the place of the sky. The elephants 
               seem to be moving on it... into the distance.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         ...and nature die?

               Knock, knock sound. The curtain moves to one side wiping the 
               elephants away with it. There is no terrified audience behind 
               the curtain. There is only light and Merrick's Mother smiling 
               a calm and benign smile.

                                     JOHN'S MUM
                         Never, oh! Never, nothing will die; 
                         the stream flows, the wind blows, 
                         the cloud fleets, the heart beats...

               The light grows brighter and brighter until we cannot see 
               John's Mother anymore. It almost blinds us.

                                     JOHN'S MUM
                         Nothing will die.

                                                                 WHITE OUT:

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

                                         THE END

               DARKNESS
               
               A pounding, metallic beat begins. Twists of sound in a tightrope
               rhythm. The snap of a military snare drum.

               They stand like sentinels. Black uniforms. Battle helmets.
               Gleaming military assault weapons. Bullet-proof shields with large

               An earthquake measuring 9.6 on the Richter

               the year 2000.
               
               Suddenly we are hit by the loudest, booming, rolling concussion
               you have ever heard. The buildings begin to shake, swaying wildly.
               The Bonaventure Hotel implodes, collapses inward in the thudding,
               slamming freight train of an earthquake. The 4-level Interchange

               A Salesman with a chin-mike speaks non-stop, unintelligible
               Chinese. A frenzied crowd gathers around him, waving money,
               placing bets.
               
               Two men sit at either end of a long table. They are in deep
               shadows, facing each other. We only get glimpses of them: One fat.
               Mirrored sunglasses. Chinese. His fingers tap on the table. A
               cockroach scurries past. Ammo belts. A sheathed combat knife the
               size of your arm. .45 automatics in holsters.
               
               The other, dressed in black. An eye-patch. Dangerous. A flash of
               two six-guns in holsters. A futuristic gunfighter. The cockroach
               dashes past his fingers. WHAP! He squashes it.
               
               The crowd goes nuts, placing bets, yelling and screaming in a
               dozen languages.
               
               The salesman places three different shaped, clear shot glasses in
               front of the two men. Then he leans over to...
               
               A VAT OF POISONOUS SNAKES. He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it
               out. The cobra hisses and squirms. Deftly, the salesman continues
               to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom
               into the first glass.
               
               He pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and
               bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass. Finally,
               he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart
               and liver. Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the
               heart and liver with his fingers. The juice drips into the third
               glass.
               
               Now the salesman stirs the glasses. The poison is clear. The blood
               is milky-green. The heart and liver are red. He places the glasses
               on the table between the two men.
               
               The two men stare at each other, motionless. The crowd continues
               placing bets at a fevered pitch. A titanium white tube floats
               above the center of the table. A laser beam of light shines from
               one end.
               
               The salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger,
               sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light
               circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead.
               
               The fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses. His hand shakes
               slightly. He hesitates. Finally he takes the glass with the red
               liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then
               gulps it down.
               
               The crowd explodes. More bets.
               
               The salesman leans over and spins the light tube again, this time
               it lands on something black, an eye-patch. Pull back to reveal a
               man with an eye-patch.
               
               The man with the eye-patch reaches forward, his hand paused
               between the remaining two glasses. He takes the one filled with
               milky-green blood and downs it fast. The crowd roars.
               
               One glass left. The two men stare at it intently.
               
               The salesman spins the light tube with more force than before. It
               circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally
               stopping on the fat man.
               
               The salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at
               the fat man. The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison.
               His trembling fingers hover above it. Then he quickly withdraws
               his hand.
               
               The crowd reacts, boos, as...
               
               The man with the eye-patch smiles. A slightly, cynical smile. And
               without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and
               drinks it down. The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops
               them with a sweep of his arm. All bets are off.
               
               The two men stand from the table. Take several steps away toward
               the end of the alley. Stand facing each other. Two gunfighters.
               
               Flashes of the two men. A piece of a black military boot. A hand
               positioned over a six-shooter. Mirrored sunglasses. A sweaty,
               trembling lip. And the eye-patched man's one good eye, blue and
               clear, staring - hard and calm as a sunny day...
               
               The draw. It happens in an instant. The alley thunders with
               gunfire. The guns buck and flash. Then silence. The two men stand
               there for a beat, until one of them, the fat man, slumps, falls
               face first into the alley, dead.
               
               The crowd goes completely ape shit as SNAKE PLISSKEN emerges from
               the shadows of the alley, holsters his guns, grabs his take of the
               money...
               
               SNAKE PLISSKEN. Long hair. A black eye-patch. A tight-lipped
               grimace. The impression of coiled aggression and intense cynicism.
               The toughest, most dangerous man on planet earth. A legend.
               
               PLISSKEN strolls out of the alley into the crowd. He counts his
               money, pockets it, as a cigarette girl approaches him. PLISSKEN
               stops her, pays for a pack of cigs. As she eyes him...
               
               CLOSEUP OF PLISSKEN'S ARM
               
               ... the cigarette girl touches him, pricks his skin with her
               fingernail. A drop of blood appears.
               
               PLISSKEN turns, stares after her, as the sound of helicopters
               rises from above in the night sky. The crowd suddenly starts to
               disperse.
               
               Helicopter searchlights blast down on the street. PLISSKEN is
               suddenly caught in the glare. He starts to move away...
               
               KACLANG!
               
               Out of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere.
               The net slams down on top of PLISSKEN, trapping him, driving him
               down to the pavement with its weight... PLISSKEN struggles inside
               the net as black figures - United States Police Force Officers -
               rush toward him, grab the net, tightening it. More cops move for
               him as we SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK...

               Mountains. It is a sprawling police complex with low concrete
               bunkers, gun emplacements, satellite communications, vehicles,
               troops, the works. ON A LARGE ASPHALT FIELD, opposite the main
               complex is Rotor City - row after row of black, multi-bladed,
               totally evil police battle helicopters parked like giant bugs on
               the ground.
               
               A throng of policemen gather at the edge of Rotor City yelling and
               cheering, their fists in the air. Cops with camcorders videotape
               the event. A police anchor reports...
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               He's been the Force's Most Wanted Man for
               10 years. Convicted of 27 moral crimes. I
               can tell you, the excitement around here
               is...
               (a great roaring skyward)
               Here he comes!
               
               A MASSIVE 7-ROTORED, 40-BLADED HELICOPTER TRANSPORT comes slamming
               down out of the black sky and lands. The growing crowd of cheering
               cops goes nuts like fans at a football game. They slap hands,
               dance wildly.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               A mammoth room filled with high-tech instrumentation. A glowing
               holographic map of L.A. fills one wall. Most of the control
               personnel have left their work stations and gather around TV sets
               all showing the Police Channel: a view of the helicopter transport
               sitting on the asphalt and the cheering crowds at the edge of
               Rotor City.
               
               A tall, steel-faced officer sits at his desk. This is Firebase
               Commander MAC "BIG DOG" MALLOY. Hard, battle weary features.
               BRAZEN, a section Lieutenant, comes up.
               
               BRAZEN
               Commander Malloy. They're bringing him
               out, sir.
               
               Malloy rises from his chair, steps to a nearby TV set, watches the
               scene from the Police Channel.
               
               MALLOY
               So we finally got him.
               

               EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT
               
               The crowd of cops is growing to a frenzy of wild anticipation.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               Hold one! The door is opening!
               
               The door of the helicopter transport slowly lowers like a
               drawbridge. Out of its black belly comes...
               
               SNAKE PLISSKEN. A steel collar is clamped around his neck. Eight
               lengths of chain stretch to eight armed guards who escort Plissken
               down the ramp. Plissken is bruised, badly beaten and tortured, his
               face a mess, but he doesn't seem to care. A line of battle-ready
               cops stand with their guns aimed right at Plissken's head as he is
               marched into camp. An army of camcorders move ahead of the Police
               Anchor as he scampers along in front of PLISSKEN, interviewing
               him.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               Hello, Plissken. Welcome to L.A.
               
               Celebrating cops cheer as Plissken is lead to...
               
               A SIGN ABOVE A CONCRETE BUNKER - DEPORTATION CENTER
               
               The bunker has one large opening, into which hundreds of deportees
               march. Guards in towers monitor the condemned as they trudge out
               of fenced-in containment areas, down walled corridors to the
               bunker entrance.
               
               The deportees are minorities, the poor, prostitutes, pimps,
               thieves, adulterers, atheists - the Morally Guilty, outcasts of
               society. Single mothers carry babies. Teenage runaways huddle
               together. There are abortion doctors, drug dealers, pornographers,
               the prisoners of a massive cultural war.
               
               As Plissken is marched toward the entrance, a loudspeaker blares
               out:
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               You are now entering the Deportation
               Center. You have been found guilty of
               moral crimes against the United States of
               America.
               
               A great cheer goes up from the cops as the Police Anchor conducts
               his interview...
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               S.D. Bob Plissken. Special Forces, Black

               Youngest man ever decorated by the
               President.
               
               Plissken's face remains so impassive as to be almost blank.
               

               INT. SODIUM VAPOR CORRIDOR - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               A glowing, vaporous-orange corridor. More cops gather to watch
               Plissken as he is escorted into the bowels of the Deportation
               Center.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes,
               Plissken. The murder of an Internal
               Revenue agent. The kidnapping of a bank
               president. Gun fighting for profit. The
               list goes on and on...
               

               INT. CONCRETE HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Deeper into the Deportation Center. Camera tracks along the
               deportees, some bleeding, some wrapped in rags. Plissken, the
               Police Anchor, camcorders and the armed escort move through the
               dark, low concrete passageway.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               You used to respect the law. Served your

               to a generation.
               
               The Police Anchor leans in as close as he dares to Plissken's
               face.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               What happened to you, war hero? You were
               the best we had.
               
               STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Steel walls. Deeper into the Deportation Center. The deportees
               here are in worse shape. Some appear to be dead. Plissken and his
               entourage continue along, as the speaker echoes a pre-recorded
               message...
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               You are sentenced to permanent expulsion
               beyond the borders of the U.S. You now
               have the option to repent of your sins and
               be electrocuted on the premises. If you
               elect this option, notify the Cleric
               Sergeant in your Processing Area.
               
               Plissken and his entourage pass deportees kneeling and praying in
               front of cloaked cleric cops, government holy men. Beyond, through
               opened doorways, see Death Row deportees being strapped into
               futuristic electric chairs.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               The whole world's watching. Every good and
               decent person who works and hard and
               follows the rules. What would say to them?
               
               Plissken's expression is blank.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               What would you say to all of us who
               believed in you, who looked up to you, who
               thought you stood for right over wrong,
               good over evil? Be my guest. What do you
               have to say, Plissken?
               
               PLISSKEN

               Call me Snake.
               
               The guards move Plissken through a doorway, and the huge steel
               doors slam shut on the Police Anchor and the camcorders.
               

               INT. CORRIDOR - PROCESSING AREA - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, Brazen, and a 3rd man, tall, charismatic, grim, move
               urgently along a corridor.
               
               BRAZEN
               ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a
               database of 5 million sociopathic
               personalities. He hit the bottom of the
               curve.
               
               MALLOY
               Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can
               pull it off - not an army, not a man.
               
               BRAZEN
               Zero emotional developments. Total lack of
               compassion. A highly developed
               psychopathic instinct to survive.
               
               3RD MAN
               Let's get this over with.
               

               INT. CONCRETE CELL - NIGHT
               
               The cell door slams shut. Plissken turns around. Writ and leg
               irons. He looks around.
               
               In the concrete cell he sees a simple table with an overhead light
               above it. A watch lies on the table. Plissken shuffles over, picks
               up the watch, examines it.
               
               The cell door opens. Malloy, Brazen, and the 3rd Man enter the
               room unarmed. The door closes.
               
               Malloy and Brazen move forward, to the edge of the light. The 3rd
               Man stays back in the shadows by the door.
               
               MALLOY
               How you doin' Plissken?
               (no reply)
               You like the watch?
               
               PLISSKEN
               You assholes didn't bring me here to give
               me this for 20 years of dedicated service.
               What'ya want?
               
               Malloy looks back to the 3rd Man in the shadows...
               
               3RD MAN
               Get to it.
               
               Malloy raises a control unit, pushes the button. The lights go
               down and a computer-enhanced image appears on the wall...
               
               

               INT. PROTOTYPE DEFENSE LAB - SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
               
               From the point of view of a surveillance camera. The lab is huge.
               Banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly
               areas. High tech. A group of government officials is being given a
               tour. Utopia, 17, the President's daughter is among them. Pretty,
               virginal, she wears a "True Love Waits" button on her flowered
               dress.
               
               MALLOY
               At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of
               government officials began a tour of the
               Livermore Defense Lab. The President's
               daughter, Utopia, was among them.
               
               Plissken continues to watch the image on the wall...
               
               MALLOY
               An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to
               Washington.
               
               The 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes...
               

               INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - CAMCORDER
               
               From the point of view of a camcorder. Utopia stands inside the
               main cabin of a plush, government 747. In one hand she holds a
               black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on
               top. In the other, a machine gun.
               
               UTOPIA
               (to the camcorder)
               To the American people - it is time to
               rise up and demand the surrender of the
               President and his corrupt theocracy of
               lies and terror.
               
               MALLOY
               At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We
               scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.
               
               Inside the surveillance room the President stares grimly as Malloy
               presses a button. Suddenly the image in front of Plissken spreads
               out all around him. He is in a virtual reality re-creation.
               

               INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - VIRTUAL REALITY
               
               Plissken stands manacled in the main cabin. A group of secret
               service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates
               a camcorder. He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera.
               She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage.
               
               UTOPIA
               Today is Day One of a brand new world. The
               days of the empire are finished.
               (beat)
               To the President - my father, you know
               what this is.
               
               She holds up the anodized box with the red button and thrusts it
               at the camcorder.
               
               UTOPIA
               You know what it will do. Unless you
               abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I
               will use it - on you.
               
               CONGRESSMAN
               Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If
               something should happen -
               
               UTOPIA
               It will be in my hands - and the hands of
               my lover.
               
               She says "lover" with all the drama a 17-year-old virgin can
               muster. The others are shocked.
               
               UTOPIA
               Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man
               I've ever known. I'm on my way to his
               arms.
               
               She moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small
               hatch in the floor, scrambles down...
               
               WHAM! The VR image suddenly disappears and Plissken is again
               standing inside the concrete cell. Malloy and Brazen stand in
               front of him.
               
               MALLOY
               Somehow during the tour, she came into
               possession of a prototype transmitting
               device. We don't know how.
               
               BRAZEN
               Utopia became depressed after her mother's
               suicide, began to withdraw into her
               virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up
               her own little world in cyberspace and
               stay in it for days at a time.
               (hits a button)
               Somebody else was in there with her.
               
               AN IMAGE APPEARS
               
               In front of Plissken: A computer-rendered VR picture of clouds and
               sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking. A Garden of
               Eden. There, coming toward us, is CUERVO JONES. South American
               terrorist. Fiercest warrior of the Third World. He wears a
               gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet. Bandoliers strapped around
               him.
               
               MALLOY
               Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian
               terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang
               in L.A.
               
               Cuervo Jones takes off the helmet He is blindingly handsome,
               charismatic. He smiles, reaches out his arms to camera as if to
               embrace it. The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's
               on a loop. The image disappears.
               
               The lights in the cell come up.
               
               BRAZEN
               Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences,
               then tried to erase them. She missed this
               fragment on the end of her last tape.
               Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR
               master data bank - and then went prowling
               around for innocent blood, someone
               vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely,
               looking for something to believe in.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Sad story. You got a cigarette?
               
               MALLOY
               Shut up, Plissken.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's the little black box do?
               
               MALLOY
               Top secret. Only on a need to know.
               
               PLISSKEN
               And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm
               goin' to Hollywood.
               
               MALLOY
               That's right, big shot. Unless you do what
               we want you're not coming back.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A.,
               find the President's daughter, secure the
               box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm
               free?
               
               MALLOY
               That's the deal.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll
               like L.A.
               
               After a couple of beats, the 3rd Man appears next to Malloy and
               Brazen. He stares at Plissken for a moment, holds up some papers.
               
               3RD MAN
               If you bring out the prototype, you'll
               receive a full pardon for every immoral
               act you have ever committed in the United
               States. Just like in '97. Remember New
               York, Plissken?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (looks at him)
               Who are you?
               
               MALLOY
               It's the President, for Christ's sake!
               
               PRESIDENT
               I give you my word. Put the prototype into
               my hands, and you're a free man.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I can see you're real concerned about your
               daughter.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Well, I'll think it over.
               
               PRESIDENT
               You're running out of time.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I've been doin' that all my life. Might as
               well do it in L.A. Everybody else there
               is.
               
               MALLOY
               Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10
               hours to live.
               
               Malloy, Brazen, and the President turn to leave...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
               
               MALLOY
               Having second thoughts?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in
               me this time.
               
               MALLOY
               You don't understand. It's already in you.
               
               PLISSKEN'S FACE
               
               As an image of the cigarette girl in New Las Vegas flashes
               suddenly. Her fingernail scratches his arm. He tightens.
               
               MALLOY
               The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an
               undercover cop. She injected you with
               incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming
               in your bloodstream. It'll start to take
               effect in 9 hours.
               
               BRAZEN
               It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus.
               Genetically engineered. 100% pure death.
               Complete nervous system shutdown. You
               crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not
               a pretty sight.
               
               Plissken takes a step toward him. Malloy holds up a large
               hypodermic.
               
               MALLOY
               Of course there's an anti-toxin.
               Neutralizes the virus immediately upon
               injection.
               (beat)
               We'll give it to you, but you have to do
               us this little favor.
               
               TWO BEATS...
               
               ...and then Plissken attacks the President, hurls himself across
               the room, throwing the chain around the President's neck...
               
               Plissken passes right through the President, causing his image to
               waver slightly, then falls on his ass.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Didn't think we were that stupid, did you?
               

               INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM
               
               The real Malloy, Brazen, and President stand in front of a laser
               camera in a small room offering a view of the cell through a
               transparent portion of the wall.
               
               MALLOY
               We're holographs.
               
               INSIDE THE CELL
               
               Plissken stares at the three images in front of him, then at the
               camera lens on the wall...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Get this crap out of me.
               
               MALLOY
               I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working
               with you, Plissken.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (beat)
               Call me Snake.
               

               INT. BRIEFING ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               Plissken checks through various tactical survival items and
               weapons laid out on a table. Brazen watches as Malloy show shim a
               high tech submachine gun.
               
               BRAZEN
               Very sweet little weapon. Core burner.
               Magnesium ammo. 500 extra rounds.
               (moves on)
               Two 9mm handguns.
               (holds up a silver pill)
               Oral projectile. Mouth dart. Hold it in
               your mouth for ten seconds, the coating
               dissolves, it becomes a weapon.
               
               Malloy breaks open the silver pill. Inside is s small, lethal
               looking dart.
               
               BRAZEN
               Urolite. It'll stun the enemy for several
               seconds.
               
               Plissken picks up a small, computerized compass.
               
               MALLOY
               Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted
               in her arm. You can locate her with this.
               
               Brazen hands Plissken a large black clip.
               
               BRAZEN
               This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo
               enhancers. Like miniaturized grenades.
               Blows through anything.
               
               Plissken snaps the clip onto his pistol, then unsnaps it.
               

               EXT. POLICE COMPLEX - NIGHT
               
               Plissken suits up. Submachine gun, handguns, six-guns. He, Brazen
               and Malloy walk quickly across the complex.
               
               MALLOY
               L.A. is in a constant state of warfare.
               Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
               
               BRAZEN
               Heavy Third World connections. They get
               weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers -
               everything is pumped into the island from
               the south.
               
               MALLOY
               Some areas have power - they're on line to
               San Onofre.
               

               EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT
               
               As Brazen's command helicopter takes off...
               

               INT. COMMAND HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               Plissken stares at a photo of the anodized prototype.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'll need to know more about this thing.
               
               MALLOY
               Only a handful of people are aware of its
               existence. Let's just say it's the
               ultimate defensive weapon.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Defense against what?
               
               MALLOY
               There's a war about to be declared, or
               didn't you know?
               
               Plissken shrugs.
               
               MALLOY
               Third World wants to live like we do - and
               they plan on taking what they want. The
               Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade
               Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make
               a run at the border, we got a full scale
               attack on the United States.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So what does this thing do?
               
               MALLOY
               All you need to know is get it back here
               by 5 a.m.
               

               EXT. WALL - ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               The Command helicopter lands near a large access tunnel inside the
               containment wall.
               

               INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, Brazen and Malloy walk through the dark, dank tunnel.
               Armed guards stand at the ready. A hatch in the tunnel floor
               stands open. A ladder disappears down into the darkness.
               
               MALLOY
               (points to the open hatch)
               You're going over by submarine. One-man
               submersible. Nuclear powered.
               
               Plissken arranges his gear, climbs into the hatch opening.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where do I put ashore?
               
               MALLOY
               Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through
               the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl.
               You should be able to pick up Utopia's
               tracer there.
               (beat)
               Once you go inside, you're on your own.
               (beat)
               You know what you have to do with the
               girl, don't you?
               (beat)
               We have to spare this nation her trial -
               for treason.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So you want me to take her out?
               (Malloy nods)
               Is that an order from the President?
               
               MALLOY
               Let's just say it's what's best for the
               country.
               
               PLISSKEN
               By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
               
               MALLOY
               A medical team will be standing by.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Not you?
               
               MALLOY
               No.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Good.
               
               KABLAMM! He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy. There's no
               damage. Malloy laughs.
               
               MALLOY
               Thought you might try that. First clip is
               filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken.
               
               Malloy kicks the hatch and it slams down on top of Plissken.
               Brazen pushes a control button, sealing it shut.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken climbs down the ladder into a small submarine bay. Below
               him on a launching rig is a sleek, black one-man submarine shaped
               like a dart. The submarine's hatch is open. Plissken climbs
               inside.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken seals the hatch behind him. He has to lie flat on his
               stomach to operate the sub. He quickly hits various switches and
               buttons, powering up the cockpit.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy and Brazen move to a surveillance-command post.
               
               PLISSKEN (V.O. RADIO)
               Com check.
               
               Malloy picks up the microphone.
               
               MALLOY
               I'm here, Plissken.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken looks at the wrist watch. It ticks down ominously. Eight
               hours and counting down...
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Stand by for launch. Ignitor.
               (Plissken pushes a button)
               Fuel rod injection.
               
               Plissken pulls a lever, watches his dials. A deep humming sound
               grows louder inside the sub.
               
               PLISSKEN
               She's in the green.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Lock fuel rods.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (hits a switch)
               Locked.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
               
               Plissken turns a throttle-like control with his left hand.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT
               
               Out of the rear tubes of Plissken's sub comes a roaring blue glow.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               PLISSKEN
               75% power.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Hands on switches and counting.
               5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY
               
               The rear tubes roar. Suddenly the sub is shot forward through a
               long, circular tunnel.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken braces himself as the cabin lurches, vibrates with the
               force.
               

               EXT. THE WALL - NEWHALL PASS - NIGHT
               
               A door in the wall opens, revealing the circulator tunnel. In a
               roaring explosion, the sub rockets out of the tunnel, shot from
               the wall like a cannonball. The submarine is airborne for several
               seconds, then drops down, and slams into the San Fernando Sea.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken is rocked with the impact. He guides the sub with hand
               controls. In front of him on a screen is a schematic diagram of
               the underwater landscape of the San Fernando Valley.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - 405 FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               In the underwater darkness, see the broken remains of the 405
               Freeway, as the subs creams past, its nuclear wake churning in the
               water.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, Brazen and other cops follow Plissken's course on a
               gigantic computer screen.
               
               MALLOY
               Plissken, watch your speed. Lots of
               obstructions down there.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - VAN NUYS CITY HALL - NIGHT
               
               As the sub rockets past the ruins of the Van Nuys City Hall,
               barely missing it.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...
               
               Plissken ignores him, carefully maneuvering the sub with his
               controls.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken... do you copy?
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - THE VENTURA FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               Camera follows the sub as it streaks along just above the
               submerged ruins of the Ventura Freeway. See the ghostly shapes of
               cars, trucks, busses below, smashed and overturned.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM
               
               They watch the sub, a red blip on the screen, move along the
               freeway.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%.
               

               EXT. VENTURA & HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY INTERCHANGE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
               
               The sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a
               hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the
               Hollywood. A sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads:
               "SPEED LIMIT 55". The sub screams past.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM
               
               Brazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status.
               
               BRAZEN
               His reactor's starting to overheat.
               
               MALLOY
               Plissken, slow down the sub. You're
               overloading the power plant.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken glances at the gauge. His nuclear turbine readout: green,
               moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...?
               
               Plissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him. One
               the screen: the red blip representing the sub is headed right
               toward a building. Plissken pulls hard on the controls.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT
               
               The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through
               it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and
               wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed
               downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object.
               
               KING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the
               currents. Plissken has maneuvered himself into the wreckage of the
               Universal Studios Tour.
               
               The sub zips through the King Kong ride into Back To The Future,
               passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean.
               It slams into the open mouth of JAWS, shattering the model into a
               million pieces.
               
               The sub continues on, bouncing through the narrow openings of the
               Earthquake Ride - broken pipes, cracked sidewalks, split walls -
               hard to tell what was the ride and what was The Big One.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken hangs on, as small jets of water spray into the cockpit
               through tiny cracks in the hull.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - MOVING WITH THE SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               The sub suddenly tips upward, rising for the surface.
               

               EXT. SHORELINE - CAHUENGA PASS - NIGHT
               
               The sub explodes out of the water, lands belly first on a hillside
               with a hard thump.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken presses the hatch controls. The sub begins to slide
               backwards down toward the water.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The
               sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear
               exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps
               out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up
               the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the
               sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing.
               
               A bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the
               antenna.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm here.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Where's the submarine? It's disappeared
               off our screens.
               
               PLISSKEN
               It's history. I gotta go.
               
               Plissken clicks off the walkie, pockets it, turns to climb up the
               hillside when...
               
               WHAM! Standing above him is a dark figure. Hooded. Carrying
               something huge and rounded at the ends.
               
               Plissken raises his submachine gun...
               
               ... as PIPELINE steps closer. He's a surfer in a black wetsuit.
               Carries a surfboard. A rifle is slung across his shoulder.
               Pipeline's face is raw, burned - too many hours surfing in the UV.
               
               PIPELINE
               Too bad about your boat, man.
               (Plissken doesn't move)
               Supposed to be some swells out here
               tonight. Big ones.
               (beat)
               You like to surf?
               
               Realizing Pipeline is no danger, Plissken moves past him up the
               hillside.
               
               PIPELINE
               You look kinda familiar.
               (beat)
               You hang out around here much?
               
               But Plissken's moved off into the darkness.
               

               EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               Plissken reaches old Mulholland Drive, now dark and desolate.
               Shells of houses stand nearby, black and empty. It has begun to
               rain.
               
               The sound of gunfire. Plissken ducks behind a tree...
               
               Two old cars come zooming up Mulholland, side by side. Windows
               down. Guns blazing at each other. They pass Plissken, continue
               down Mulholland, ripping each other apart with gunfire. Plissken
               darts across Mulholland, down the mountainside.
               

               EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               The rain pours down as Plissken makes his way down a steep
               incline.
               
               CRACK! A dark figure steps out from behind a tree. Plissken spins,
               submachine gun ready. It's Pipeline.
               
               PIPELINE
               Hey, man. I know who you are. You're Snake
               Plissken. Man, I can't believe you're
               really here.
               
               More gunfire from above on Mulholland...
               
               PIPELINE
               Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
               
               PIPELINE
               (points)
               Down that way.
               
               Plissken starts down.
               
               PIPELINE
               Be careful. Some real strange dudes
               hangin' out there these days.
               
               Plissken continues moving, now just a blurry figure in the rain.
               
               PIPELINE
               Hey Snake - what're you doin' around here,
               man?
               (as Plissken disappears)
               I heard they busted you up real good in
               Cleveland...
               

               EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way
               down the hillside. Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then
               stops. The trees drip with moisture. Suddenly, a huge KATHUMP from
               above him. Plissken looks back. A huge mudslide is roaring its way
               down the hill toward him.
               
               Plissken races down the hill, but the mudslide cascades downward
               like a freight train, catches up with him, sweeps him off his
               feet... and Plissken goes riding down the hill, rumbling and
               sliding in the mud.
               

               EXT. STAND OF TREES - NIGHT
               
               The mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees, spreads out,
               slows. A completely mud-covered, black Plissken climbs out of the
               goo. He's dripping with it. His one good eye shines in the
               moonlight. He takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline
               when...
               
               A VOICE (SPINAL) (V.O.)
               Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin' noise!
               
               Plissken spins. He's standing right next to SPINAL, the leader of
               the Black Cowboy Gang. Dressed in black, boots with spurs, black
               duster, black cowboy hat, he carries an automatic rifle. He looks
               just like Charles Barkley.
               
               Plissken looks around, realizes he's in the middle of a small army
               of Black Cowboys, crouched behind the trees, waiting in ambush.
               Covered with mud, Plissken blends right in.
               
               SPINAL
               Take cover, fool.
               
               Plissken jumps behind a tree, looks down the hillside.
               
               PLISSKEN'S POV - THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               Below his position is the Hollywood Bowl. A huge cross is on
               stage, and the cross is on fire.
               
               CLOSER - HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               A group of white hooded men, the K.K.K., stand in front of the
               burning cross holding a ceremony. Next to the cross on stage, a
               hooded K.K.K. string quartet begins playing a Hayden concerto.
               
               Plissken reacts.
               
               SPINAL
               Let's take him.
               
               A Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others
               quickly race down the hillside. He fires.
               
               THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               A 40mm armor-piercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it
               rockets toward the burning cross and - KABLAMMO! A fireball blows
               pieces of the cross into the air. The K.K.K. spin around...
               
               A blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from
               the hills. They open fire. A K.K.K. Grand Dragon is picked off his
               feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire. A
               hail of bullets hits the K.K.K. They return fire, but are
               overwhelmed. They are hit, jerking and twisting. Fire from the
               Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts
               of lightning. The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it
               starts to rain again.
               
               Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight
               continues. Four K.K.K. leap out from behind a row of seats and
               jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground. In a blinding
               flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying. As
               he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun, he sees that the
               rain is washing the mud off his body...
               
               AND SO DOES SPINAL, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is
               washed clean by the rain. Spinal raises his weapon, then stops.
               
               SPINAL
               Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.
               
               Plissken slowly stands, his submachine gun in his hand. Behind
               them, the firefight is almost over. The K.K.K. scatter into the
               rain...
               
               SPINAL
               Hey, what's going down, Snake?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm looking for somebody.
               
               SPINAL
               Who ain't?
               
               Plissken pulls out his tracer. It is blipping red, just south of
               the Bowl.
               
               SPINAL
               Say, is it true what they say about
               Cleveland, man?
               
               Plissken doesn't answer. He moves on through the rain...
               
               SPINAL
               Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can
               always shift down and mojo with us
               anytime.
               

               EXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT
               
               The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped
               again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the
               distance, the sound of thumping music.
               

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT HIGHLAND - NIGHT
               
               Pandemonium! Music blares. It's the old Supremes hit, "Love is
               Like An Itchin' In My Heart." Crowds dance in the street. It's
               like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs
               celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic.
               Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under
               the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads:
               "SAFE SEX", "NO CONDOMS NEEDED", "POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES",
               "SATISFACTION GUARANTEED"
               
               One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken.
               
               CLOSEUP - THE HOOKER
               
               Opening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff. A polypropylene
               orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a
               small, pink balloon. She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the
               air. Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises.
               
               HIS POV - COMING DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD
               
               ... is a caravan of vehicles. The crowd parts to let them through,
               cheering insanely. Plissken ducks into an alley, watches...
               
               The caravan passes Plissken's position. Two men on horseback lead
               a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all
               scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard.
               
               Plissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired
               hooker joins him, rubs his arm. She has no polypropylene, at least
               none that we can see.
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and
               I do some celebrating?
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's going on?
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               You must be new around here.
               (beat)
               You look familiar. Have I done you before?
               
               Plissken grabs the hooker.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's happening?
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang.
               Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man
               'round here tonight.
               (whispers)
               He's gonna take down the police and make
               'em kiss his fine ass.
               
               Plissken lets her go, stares...
               
               HIS POV - A CADILLAC
               
               ... is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels.
               Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large
               glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of
               light and flicking them back into the night...
               
               Behind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least. And
               there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear
               and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the
               prototype. Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind
               her. He is huge and evil. Dressed like Pancho Villa.
               
               Plissken stares as the Cadillac passes. The hooker cheers along
               with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's
               moved off...
               
               Several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan. Mescalitos
               ride with their women slung behind them. As the last bike passes,
               Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of
               the cycle, jumps on.
               
               ON THE MOTORCYCLE
               
               The Mescalito biker turns to react...
               
               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the
               bike, hops up on the seat.
               
               KAVROOM! Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the
               other bikers, toward the head of the caravan. Plissken zooms
               along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan...
               

               EXT. LA BREA AND SUNSET BOULEVARDS - NIGHT
               
               As the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the
               corner.
               
               ON PLISSKEN
               
               Coming right behind him are four Mescalitos on Harleys - chains,
               iron bars, and swords in their hands. Plissken stares up ahead.
               
               HIS POV - THE CADILLAC
               
               ... is just a few feet away. Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
               
               Plissken guns it when suddenly two Mescalitos pull up on either
               side of him. One of them swings a chain. Plissken grabs it with
               one hand, and with his other hand, aims his submachine gun and
               fires! The Mescalito and bike go flying, and Plissken holds on to
               the chain.
               
               Atop the Cadillac, Cuervo Jones reacts to the sound of gunfire. He
               turns to see...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               As the other Mescalito riding behind him swings a chain. Plissken
               swings his. The two chains snap together, intertwining. Then
               Plissken squeezes his hand-brake. He screeches to a stop. The
               Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own
               chain, off the Harley. Finally the Harley flops over, skids,
               explodes. Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac.
               
               Two more Mescalitos pull up on either side of Plissken. They take
               aim at him with their automatic rifles. Plissken pulls a sudden
               wheelie, lifts the front of his bike up into the air, rides on the
               back wheel. The two Mescalitos fire - directly into each other.
               They fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement.
               
               Plissken surges the bike forward, coming up on a Mescalito on
               horseback who turns and fires. Plissken ducks and the bullet rips
               through the rear tire. The tire blows and the bike swerves out of
               control. Plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the
               saddle.
               
               THE HORSE
               
               Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for
               control of the mount. Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them
               around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst.
               Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the
               saddle, bouncing onto the pavement.
               
               Plissken gallops ahead, circling a lasso high above his head,
               pounding down on a biker. The lasso takes flight and finds it
               mark, the biker's neck. Plissken pulls the lasso taut, ties the
               end to the saddle horn, rides his mount parallel to the biker.
               
               THE BIKE
               
               With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off,
               jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump.
               
               THE HORSE
               
               Takes off down the street, dragging the biker by the neck.
               
               THE CADILLAC
               
               Speeds up as Plissken moves up to the Mustang five cars behind. He
               swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk. Plissken climbs up
               to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car
               in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car...
               
               MESCALITOS
               
               Lean out their car windows, firing at him, but Plissken keeps
               moving toward the Cadillac...
               
               SUDDENLY A HAND
               
               Reaches out a car window and grabs Plissken's submachine gun.
               Plissken turns to snatch it back -
               
               WHEN CUERVO JONES
               
               Leaps from the Cadillac and takes Plissken down to the roof.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Snake Plissken.
               
               They struggle. Cuervo raises his machete. Plissken grabs his
               wrist, flips him over, knocks the machete off into the street,
               smacks Cuervo in the face.
               
               A BOLAS-SWINGING MESCALITO
               
               Comes roaring up on his bike, throws the bolas...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               As the bolas hit him, wrap around his neck, the balls thunking him
               in the face, sending him flying...
               
               KAWHAP! Plissken hits the pavement hard. He skids, rolls, and at
               last slams into the edge of the sidewalk. The caravan rumbles away
               down Sunset. The hand in the car window still holds Plissken's
               submachine gun.
               
               Cuervo crouches on the roof, hissing at Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Later, Snake. We finish it later.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Lies there for several beats, then climbs to his feet.
               
               HIS POV - THE CARAVAN
               
               ... disappears up Sunset.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Stands alone in the deserted street. The ruins of a supermarket,
               cheap motels, liquor stores - all empty, desolate.
               
               He looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie.
               After a beat, he starts moving up Sunset, checking his two 9mm
               handguns, slipping them into their holsters.
               

               EXT. SUNSET AND DOHENY - NIGHT
               
               On the border of Beverly Hills, Sunset stretches off into the
               darkness beyond the intersection. A slight wind blows litter
               aimlessly along. There are occasional sounds: Creaks, distant
               clangs.
               
               Plissken approaches the intersection. He carries Utopia's compass
               homing device. It is silent. The small screen's blank. Then
               Plissken glances at his wrist watch.
               
               CLOSE - WRIST WATCH
               
               Three hours gone.
               
               Plissken stands for a moment, staring off down Sunset...
               
               VOICE (V.O.)
               Snake Plissken, right?
               
               He spins around.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               Sits in an old beach chair on the sidewalk, a map to the stars
               sign in front of him. In his late 50's, he's a petty thief, con
               man. He's been hustling tourists and everybody else all his life.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Wow! Snake Plissken!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie listens to WAYWARD WIND by Gogi Grant on a
               small, metal-plated portable radio. He clicks off the radio,
               rises, walks over to Plissken.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You're a star in your own right, you know
               that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How
               you doin'?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where'd they go?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Man, I'd love to have your autograph,
               Snake.
               
               He searches around in his pockets, comes up with pen and paper.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I've been hearing about you ever since
               that New York deal back in the 90's.
               You're one smooth operator.
               (offers pen and paper)
               Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death's
               Head, one to Slasher Smith...?
               
               Plissken grabs him by the throat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where are they?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man
               with the juice, Snake. Got the President's
               daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big
               doings.
               
               Plissken draws a 9mm and points it at Map To The Stars Eddie's
               forehead.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Location.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where
               the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've
               been there, y'know.
               
               Plissken releases him, as suddenly the tracer beeps. On the device
               Plissken sees a small red pulsing dot. West.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Nice little gizmo you got there.
               (whispers conspiratorially)
               Look, Snake. I've got connections in this
               town. You need something, I'm your man.
               
               Without a word Plissken turns, walks away down Sunset Boulevard
               toward Beverly Hills.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey - you can't go there, Snake. You can't
               walk through Beverly Hills.
               
               Plissken's figure disappears...
               

               EXT. SUNSET - SIGN - NIGHT
               
               The old Beverly Hills sign. It's been painted over in dripping red
               letters: "QUIET - SURGICAL ZONE - STAY OUT"
               
               Plissken ignores the sign, keeps walking down a completely dark
               Sunset Boulevard.
               
               

               EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken walks past the once-beautiful mansions along Sunset. Now
               they are dark, ruined.
               
               CLOSER - BEVERLY HILLS MANSION
               
               As a twisted, mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the
               wrist pulls aside a window curtain. The face behind the window is
               in shadows, but we can just make out its pale, discolored
               features. The other hand brings up a walkie-talkie...
               
               SENTRY
               (into walkie)
               Specimen moving west on Sunset.
               

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUNSET AND BEVERLY DRIVE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive.
               The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his
               right. He stops, stares down Sunset...
               
               HIS POV - A FIGURE
               
               Emerges from the shadows. This is the gatekeeper. Strange,
               mismatched body parts. A black-skinned arm attached to a pale
               white body. His face is unnaturally smooth - too many face lifts.
               He carries a torch.
               
               GATEKEEPER
               Halt!
               (beat)
               Where are you going?
               (no reply)
               Are you here for the auction?
               
               BEHIND PLISSKEN
               
               Figures have suddenly moved out into the street, all with
               mismatched body parts - heads too large for their torsos, female
               body parts mixed with male heads, all sewn together with large,
               uneven stitches. Plissken is surrounded.
               
               GATEKEEPER
               Welcome to Beverly Hills.
               
               Plissken raises his gun, starts to move, when suddenly a figure
               rises behind him out of the shadows...
               
               A MULTI-COLORED FLESH HAND
               
               Raises a lead pipe, brings it down hard...
               
               ON PLISSKEN'S HEAD
               
               THUNK! He goes out like a light.
               
               As Plissken slumps unconscious to the street, the figures move for
               him. Their arms lock around him, drag him away with amazing speed
               - a pack of wolves on a deer.
               
               CLOSEUP - PLISSKEN - NIGHT
               
               Plissken bolts awake, to find himself tied to a cross. It's
               lurching back and forth as though the ground is moving.
               

               EXT. RODEO DRIVE - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken is being carried down Rodeo Driveon the cross by a throng
               of surgical failures. They carry torches. Dressed in tatters.
               Their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly.
               
               Rodeo Drive is a bizarre marketplace of body parts. The once
               beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles.
               Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice.
               
               Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and
               Armani displays more eclectic, high priced pieces sewn together
               like sculptures in their windowfronts. A giant rift runs down the
               street's center. Acrid smoke rises.
               
               The throng stops at an intersection, and Plissken's cross is
               anchored in the middle of the street. Surrounding the intersection
               are patients of every size, age, sex.
               
               Plissken looks over, sees another cross being carried up and
               planted right next to his. A beautiful girl is tied to this cross.
               This is TASLIMA, 20's, Iranian, the face of a Persian princess.
               She's dressed in black leather, and basically has an IQ of around
               50.
               
               TASLIMA
               Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My
               name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Are you crazy?
               
               TASLIMA
               A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be
               dead. So are you, Snake.
               
               Plissken looks across the street. Our of the ruins of the once
               famous red door of Elizabeth Arden come an arm of women facialists
               with acid-burned faces from one-too-many skin peelings wielding
               knives, saws, horrible-looking carving instruments...
               
               TASLIMA
               I can't believe I got caught.
               (sighs)
               I run with Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang.
               Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up
               sometimes. I forget stuff.
               
               Plissken struggles with his bonds.
               
               TASLIMA
               I left my boyfriend's place tonight, took
               a wrong turn...
               (sighs again)
               Oh, Snake, I'm really kind of out of it
               sometimes.
               
               OUT OF THE RED DOOR come more interns and nurses carrying surgical
               pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts.
               
               The throng of facialists, patients, interns and nurses surround
               Plissken and Taslima on the crosses. They move back to the
               sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from Plissken
               and Taslima is about to begin. The gurneys are wheeled into place
               and set up as large cutting tables. The facialists take their
               positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What are they?
               
               TASLIMA
               They live here, used to be like us. But
               after too many silicon implants, their
               muscles turned to jelly. The only way they
               survive is to have body parts transplanted
               over and over again.
               (whispers)
               Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills
               gets out alive.
               
               PLISSKEN
               No screamin' shit.
               
               TASLIMA
               Oh no, it's the Doctor.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               TASLIMA
               The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
               
               THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON GENERAL OF BEVERLY HILLS
               
               Steps out into the street. He appears incredibly gorgeous, a hunk
               of a man, put together by the finest body parts available in
               Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer examination,
               he's got no lower jaw. Instead, there is a rusting metal grid-work
               attached beneath each ear. It never moves. He can actually speak
               through a metal box attached to his windpipe.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               
               Stands in front of them. He raises his hands to quiet the crowd.
               He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before
               him. He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made
               up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               I've never seen more beautiful specimens.
               There will be no auction tonight. These
               body parts will go to those who need them
               the most.
               
               The crowd gumbles.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck.
               With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto
               his tongue, closes his mouth.
               
               The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward
               Plissken.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame
               you only have one.
               
               A nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it
               in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face
               to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good
               eye from its socket with his scalpel tips.
               
               FFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart!
               
               WHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He
               freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls
               forward.
               
               The scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the
               rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut!
               
               Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other
               hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off
               the step-ladder.
               
               WHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time
               as the doctor hits the pavement.
               
               The patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor
               lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly.
               
               Snake starts to run...
               
               TASLIMA
               Snake, help me.
               
               SNAKE
               Why?
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know.
               
               Almost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free. Then he runs. Taslima
               follows him.
               
               Plissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees
               Taslima following...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't follow me.
               
               TASLIMA
               You need help.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Like hell I do.
               
               Then Plissken comes to a dead stop.
               
               HIS POV - DOWN THE STREET
               
               Comes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken,
               pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone
               street...
               

               EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives
               chase. They stop at another small alley between two large
               buildings.
               
               TASLIMA
               Down this way.
               
               They disappear into the small alley.
               

               EXT. SMALL ALLEY - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT
               
               It's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on
               either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75
               foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire.
               
               PLISSKEN
               This is a dead end.
               (looks at her)
               You took us into a dead end!
               
               TASLIMA
               I just thought you wanted to get away. I
               didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
               
               KACLANK! They turn...
               
               The doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from
               his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow...
               
               Plissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Go!
               
               He follows Taslima through the window.
               

               INT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the
               balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting
               hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters -
               "CAA" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are
               wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place.
               
               They stop at a dark hallway. Taslima moves cautiously ahead.
               
               TASLIMA
               Be careful of the bald cats. They live in
               these buildings.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The what?
               
               Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands
               are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw
               dagger toward Plissken's good eye.
               
               Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two
               men.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (yelling)
               Are you gonna stand there? Give me the
               gun!
               
               Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor
               fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts
               three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.
               
               Plissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good
               measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway...
               

               INT. FIRST FLOOR - REAR EXIT - NIGHT
               
               They come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door.
               
               PLISSKEN
               How do we get out of here?
               
               TASLIMA
               Sewers. Come on.
               
               She pushes open the door...
               

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails
               rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit.
               
               Taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street.
               
               TASLIMA
               Down there.
               
               Plissken lifts the grating. Taslima jumps in, followed by
               Plissken...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Dim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the
               sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving
               chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain
               seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and
               run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients
               overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...
               
               Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird
               whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It
               gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming
               and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping
               back down the tunnel.
               
               FROM DOWN THE TUNNEL
               
               An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment.
               
               TASLIMA
               Snake - what is it?
               
               PLISSKEN
               How the hell am I supposed to know? This
               is your damn city.
               
               Slowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye -
               floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing
               larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a
               blasting, ringing sound. Music!
               
               It's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC!
               
               From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart.
               
               On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an
               optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music
               blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of
               the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in
               jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat
               is hooked to his belt.
               
               He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the
               music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He
               holds the gun on them.
               
               Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO
               BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off
               the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like
               Los Lobos' lead guitarist.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               What're you doing in here?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Looking to get out.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Which way?
               
               With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken.
               Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight.
               With it, he examines Plissken's face.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               You're Snake Plissken.
               
               TASLIMA
               Yes. Isn't he cool?
               
               There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished.
               Pendejo Bob extends his hand.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me
               Pendejo Bob.
               
               Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and
               footfalls of the patients gets closer...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Those damn patients are coming back. You'd
               better climb aboard.
               
               Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo
               Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction.
               

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
               
               The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only
               light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               I use the eye and the music to scare em
               off. They're so whacked out, man, it works
               great. Chased a whole bunch of em right
               off the edge there a few months ago.
               
               He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the
               passage.
               
               TASLIMA
               (she peers over the side)
               How far down does it go?
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Don't know - never do hear em land.
               Earthquake opened it up.
               
               The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel...
               
               INSIDE THE TUNNEL
               
               Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and
               sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up
               ahead is a door marked: "SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL"
               

               INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control
               center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges
               and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered
               with dust and grime.
               
               Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children,
               all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open
               fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of
               sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade
               launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked
               everywhere.
               
               The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               I own this whole place. Used to work here
               in the old days. I was right in this room
               when the big one hit. What a mess. We were
               waist high in shit.
               (turns proudly to them)
               Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed
               at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought
               my whole family, my amigos, down here to
               live with me.
               
               TASLIMA
               Gun runners.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, it's a living, baby.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat
               to China, take an airplane to Brazil?
               (looks at Taslima)
               Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place,
               Snake. We got our problems, sure - but
               this is paradise, man.
               
               Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to
               Plissken.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns?
               Explosives? I can get you a crate of
               hellfire grenades, no problem - five
               hours.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               All the sewers are collapsed under Venice.
               You have to go topside. Right up there.
               
               He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the
               darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other,
               carrying crates of weapons.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway.
               Just follow the signs. Get off at the
               Lincoln Exit, turn left.
               
               Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the
               ladder, followed by Taslima...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss.
               You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime
               at all.
               

               EXT. STREET UNDER SANTA MONICA FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate.
               Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the
               sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in
               heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night.
               
               Taslima points to a freeway on-ramp.
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I
               don't think it's such a good idea.
               
               Plissken starts toward the on-ramp. Taslima doesn't move.
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeways are dangerous.
               
               He keeps walking.
               
               TASLIMA
               Goodbye, Snake.
               
               Plissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile. It's as
               close to 'thank you' as he gets.
               
               TASLIMA
               Sun's coming up in a few hours.
               
               She walks up to him.
               
               TASLIMA
               UV's gonna be bad today. I have a friend
               who's got a place near here. We can crash
               there if you want, Snake.
               (she moves close to him)
               I'd love to take care of you. Make you
               feel good.
               
               Without an answer Plissken turns and walks away...
               

               EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               As far as the eye can see there are lines of rusting cars and
               trucks, bumper to bumper like a giant junkyard rush hour.
               
               Plissken walks up the on-ramp, onto the freeway. He strides past
               rows of junked cars. A few of them have people inside...
               
               There is a Mercedes rusted to its frame, its driver an 80-year-old
               in sunglasses, drinking from a bottle. A pickup truck full of old
               illegal aliens packed in like sardines. Someone cooks from a
               barbecue grill. An RV. An old man sits in the opened doorway,
               staring at Plissken as he passes. Two old ladies in housecoats
               stare at him through the windows.
               
               CLICK, CLICK! A sound behind Plissken. He spins, 9mm ready...
               
               It's Taslima, running to catch up with him.
               
               TASLIMA
               I changed my mind. I'm going with you,
               wherever you're going.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (gestures to the cars)
               What the hell is this?
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeway.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I know that. There are people in some of
               these cars.
               
               TASLIMA
               It's where they live. I guess after
               everything happened, they just needed to
               do what they'd always done before. During
               the daytime, they just pull down the
               shades on their windows and sleep.
               
               Plissken continues walking. Taslima catches up...
               
               TASLIMA
               What are you gonna do in Venice?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Find Cuervo Jones.
               
               TASLIMA
               No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
               
               Suddenly a shot rings out. Taslima is struck and falls. Plissken
               drops between the cars and crawls over to her.
               
               TASLIMA
               Run, Snake...They're coming.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               She touches his hand and looks at him softly.
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know.
               
               Taslima dies. Plissken stares at her for a moment.
               
               More shots ring out - landing very close to him.
               
               FREEWAY EMBANKMENTS
               
               From out of the heavy bushes along the freeway storm a dozen
               Mescalitos moving quickly - firing as they go. Behind them grinds
               an ancient garbage truck mounted with a 50-caliber machine gun.
               Atop the truck is Delgado. He wears a flame thrower on his back.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Returns fire, rolls under a car and begins crawling. All around
               him people jump out of their cars, begin firing back at the
               Mescalitos.
               
               THE GARBAGE TRUCK
               
               Smashes through a rusting Volkswagen, heading straight toward him.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Reaches the edge of the freeway, dives for the bushes.
               
               AS THE GARBAGE TRUCK
               
               Roars past, firing into the vehicles on the freeway, the people
               running, screaming...
               

               EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
               
               Clawing his way through the undergrowth, Plissken bursts onto a
               side street. Behind him come the Mescalitos on foot. Plissken
               runs, firing back every step of the way...
               
               AHEAD ON THE STREET
               
               Suddenly, in the blowing mist in front of him, a car screeches
               into view. It's a perfectly restored, 1966 Cadillac convertible.
               Candy-apple red. The stereo blasts "Last Night" by the Satellites.
               
               And behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hop in, Snake!
               
               THE UNDERGROWTH
               
               As the garbage truck bursts through. Delgado is behind the machine
               gun, blasting away, burning up the street. Bullets are flying
               everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the
               back seat. He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie
               roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke.
               
               DELGADO
               
               Takes aim with his flame thrower... KAWHOOSH!
               
               A GIANT TONGUE OF FLAME
               
               Shoots out from the nozzle like a flaming spear. It streaks down
               the street, just missing the tail of the Cadillac as it swerves
               around a corner...
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street. Plissken climbs
               into the front seat.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Snake - that was great. They almost
               burned your ass off!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself. Plissken is
               almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks.
               Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally,
               the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows
               down to a cruise of 70.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Too many people know where you're going,
               Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his
               men were back there waiting for you.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Delgado?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough
               hombre. You don't understand, Snake.
               Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island.
               We're on the move, man. Big time.
               

               EXT. DARK INTERSECTION - NIGHT
               
               The Cadillac smashes through an intersection, knocking two old
               junked cars out of the way.
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               Plissken jams his 9mm into Map To The Stars Eddie's ear.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Stop the damn car.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               No way.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I said pull over.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               All right. Anything for you, Snake.
               (beat)
               Although I was going to take you to Cuervo
               Jones' place.
               
               Plissken lowers the gun.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where is it?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Right over there.
               
               He points. Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a
               button on the steering wheel with his finger.
               
               ON THE DASHBOARD
               
               A small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two-
               inch machine gun barrel. Before he can do anything, four rounds
               rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Grits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four
               holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel
               closes up over the barrel.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Pretty neat, huh? This is Cuervo's car. He
               lets me use it sometimes.
               (looks at Plissken)
               Not to worry, Snake. You were just shot
               with a fun-gun. You feel it?
               
               Plissken gulps for air.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Pure mesh, man. 100-proof artery choker.
               
               Plissken slumps back, collapses in the seat.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Like Cuervo says, when the hit pulls you
               down to one inch from death, that is
               living, man.
               
               PLISSKEN'S POV - THE DRUG
               
               Kicks in hard. Surreal colors float through the dark, devastated
               streets of Venice.
               
               Plissken fights desperately against the drug, but he can't move.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You should've talked to me first, Snake. I
               could've set this whole thing up. I'm
               actually Cuervo's agent, you know.
               
               As Plissken sags, losing consciousness, Map To The Stars Eddie's
               voice begins to fade...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And I'd love to represent you, too. We
               could make a bundle together. I know I
               could really help your career...I mean,
               you're a legend and all - but the last
               couple years, man, it's like you've fallen
               off the face of the earth.
               
               ON PLISSKEN'S FACE
               
               As the world crashes to black!
               
               FADE IN:
               

               EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL LAX - NIGHT
               
               Like a giant, scorched daddy-long-legs, the architectural identity
               of the LA airport rises above the empty parking lot littered with
               the skeletal remains of burned-out cars and airport shuttles. The
               wrecks of old 747s lie twisted and bent across the tarmac.
               
               BEHIND IT
               
               Surrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former
               Bradley Terminal defaced with graffiti, the sign now reading:
               "MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL"
               
               PLISSKEN'S GOOD EYE
               
               Opens. Looks around fuzzily.
               

               INT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
               
               He is in Cuervo Jones lair. Huge. Torch-lit. Plissken lies in the
               center of the room, chained to a treadmill. He is surrounded by
               Mescalitos.
               
               In one corner of the room is lots of high-tech equipment.
               Computers. A VR simulator. Most of the Mescalitos are gathered
               around a big screen TV. They watch the 207th Annual Academy Awards
               from Carefree, Arizona.
               
               Cuervo Jones strides toward Plissken. Map To The Stars Eddie
               scurries along at his side.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't
               I? All I'm asking for is what you
               promised.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               We'll see.
               
               Cuervo Jones stops in front of Plissken. Sees that he's awake.
               Holds out a glass filled with red liquid.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Carrot juice?
               (no response)
               Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you.
               No?
               (no response)
               Your health.
               
               Cuervo Jones downs the carrot juice. Plissken lifts his head,
               grimaces. Sweat pours down his face. He gasps for air.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts
               real bad.
               (beat)
               That's good.
               
               He kneels down next to Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Dying isn't good enough for you. You need
               pain. You'll never make it to where you
               want to go without a little pain.
               
               He stands, considers Plissken for a moment.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So
               typical of American idealism. The old
               west, Snake.
               
               Cuervo Jones tosses the glass to Map To The Stars Eddie. He's
               beginning to enjoy the moment, performing for Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Man against the sky. The individual.
               Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much
               in America, Snake. You remind them of what
               they used to be.
               
               Cuervo Jones walks to a door, opens it. Beyond is a huge courtyard
               filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly,
               illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go. They are
               being fed and cared for by Mescalitos.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Here is the real L.A., Snake.
               
               Plissken lifts his head to see.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               The poor. The old. The lost. People
               without hope.
               
               He crosses back to Plissken...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Do you know what they want? One word.
               Liberation.
               (beat)
               They want a chance to live - before it's
               all gone. They've been hated for too long
               -
               (smiles)
               Now it's their turn.
               
               He gestures to his men, who move to Plissken and begin carefully
               unlocking him from the treadmill.
               
               Still wobbly, Plissken crawls to his feet...
               
               As Utopia comes bounding up from the big screen TV. Still dressed
               in her racy underwear, she gives Cuervo Jones a kiss. She still
               carries the prototype with her.
               
               UTOPIA
               Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best
               Actress.
               
               Cuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her. She holds
               on to it.
               
               UTOPIA
               You said I could hold it.
               
               He yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected.
               Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken.
               
               UTOPIA
               Who's that?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You never heard of Snake Plissken?
               
               Utopia takes a couple steps closer, squints.
               
               UTOPIA
               He doesn't look like his picture.
               (frown)
               I bet he's fake.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
               
               UTOPIA
               Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
               
               Cuervo Jones gives her a slap on the butt, which startles Utopia.
               
               UTOPIA
               Ooww!
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Go on now. Do as I say.
               
               Plissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               I'm going to show her what it means to be
               a woman - for the first time in her
               pathetic little life.
               (smiles)
               Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs
               love.
               
               He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You want to hook up with us? Join the
               revolution? We're all getting out of here
               tomorrow night.
               (holds up the prototype)
               We're gonna rule the world. Come with us,
               Snake.
               
               Plissken says nothing. His good eye glares.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish
               it later. So guess what? It's later.
               
               He motions to his men, who grab Plissken and drag him away...
               

               INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT
               
               The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with
               machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken
               is hurled in. The door slams shut.
               
               Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man
               steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado.
               
               DELGADO
               You're mine now, Snake. All mine.
               
               Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming
               machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his
               wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Shit.
               
               Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just
               barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor...
               
               Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet.
               Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and
               wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA-
               CLANG!
               
               Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself
               through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick
               right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the
               machetes CLANKS to the floor...
               
               Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises...
               
               WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws...
               
               THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at
               it in horror, then crumbles to the floor.
               

               EXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
               
               The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top
               and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by
               Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on
               those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their
               cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal.
               
               Above, on top of the terminal, see a figure move.
               
               TOP OF MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL
               
               It's Plissken. He grabs an electrical wire and throws it over the
               side...
               
               PARKING LOT - A MESCALITO GUARD
               
               Stands watching the caravan pull away. He doesn't see the wire
               dangling behind him, and Plissken shinnying down it.
               
               Beat. Beat.
               
               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the
               ground, takes his rifle.
               
               Plissken quickly moves down the dark street after the caravan.
               

               EXT. THE FORUM - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones' caravan comes rolling down Manchester, into a vast
               parking lot toward the Forum. Portions of the gigantic sports
               arena have been damaged in the earthquake, but crowds still pour
               into the entrances.
               
               The caravan pulls up at the Forum Club entrance. Cuervo Jones,
               Utopia, Map To The Stars Eddie and the others enter.
               
               AS PLISSKEN
               
               Approaches, ducks behind an old junked car.
               
               THE FORUM - DAMAGED WALL
               
               Plissken sneaks up to a crumbled, broken wall of the Forum, crawls
               inside through a large crack...
               

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - THE FORUM - NIGHT
               
               Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms. Hear
               cheering from the main arena. Slowly Plissken moves to a door,
               opens it, steps out...
               

               INT. FORUM HALLWAY - NIGHT
               
               The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy
               hallway.
               
               Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead. Plissken tenses.
               
               Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a
               body on a stretcher. As they pass, Plissken notices the body is
               wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes.
               
               He moves forward...
               

               INT. FORUM ARENA - NIGHT
               
               Plissken peers into the main arena. A basketball game is underway.
               The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the
               other. They cheer wildly for their respective teams. Pipeline is
               in the crowd, enjoying the game...
               
               Plissken moves closer, among the crowd along the baseline. The
               whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting. Above
               his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down.
               
               There's blood everywhere on the floor. The referees wear bullet-
               proof body suits and helmets. Trainers with stretchers stand by.
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 5 - 4...
               
               A BLACK MUSLIM
               
               Dribbles the ball towards the basket.
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 3 - 2...
               
               A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand and take aim.
               
               
               THE BLACK MUSLIM
               
               Pulls up into a jump shot, releases the ball into the air. It
               sails through the basket just as the horn goes off, beating the
               24-second violation.
               
               The Black Muslim crowd cheers. The Korean Dragons sit down.
               Plissken watches...
               
               CUERVO JONES, UTOPIA AND THE OTHERS
               
               Moving through the seats on the Korean Dragon side of the court.
               Map To The Stars Eddie stands near the baseline, listening to the
               game on his silver portable radio...
               
               THE REFEREE
               
               Hands the ball to a Korean Dragon guard. The Korean Dragon
               dribbles the ball down court, into the corner and passes it off.
               The Korean Dragons can't get a shot off...
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Above Plissken's head ticks down: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1... HONK!
               
               THE KOREAN DRAGON
               
               Guard still has the ball - the shot clock horn has gone off - 24
               second violation.
               
               A whole row of Black Muslims with rifles stand up, take aim, and
               fire!
               
               BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
               
               The Korean Dragon guard is riddled with bullets. He falls dead on
               the floor. The Trainers with stretchers quickly collect his body
               and hurry off the court.
               
               Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops.
               
               ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               (sound of effect of breaking
               glass)
               Shot clock!
               
               The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! "I Love L.A."
               begins playing on the loudspeaker.
               
               The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot
               like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players,
               JAMAAL, notices Plissken.
               
               JAMAAL
               Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother
               Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.
               
               The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand,
               thumping chests, high-fiving each other.
               
               JAMAAL
               Welcome aboard, Snake.
               
               But Plissken pays no attention. He sees:
               
               CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
               
               Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the
               court.
               
               CLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
               
               Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce
               man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face.
               Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has
               a firm grip on the prototype.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               The time is now. We are the strongest. If
               we go together, the others will come.
               (beat)
               We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go
               together. What do you say?
               
               Xi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps
               into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good,
               cold eye.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking
               it out in trade. I need a favor...
               
               JAMAAL
               Sure, Snake. Anything.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I need to get across the court now...
               without drawing attention to myself.
               
               JAMAAL
               Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore
               thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake.
               Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's
               kick some butt!
               
               The players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they
               move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken.
               
               JAMAAL
               (whispers)
               You play much pick-up ball, Snake?
               
               Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end.
               
               JAMAAL
               Whatever happens, watch the shot clock,
               man.
               
               The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the
               ball. The game is underway.
               
               Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover.
               They go into a set play.
               
               The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use
               slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full
               combat.
               
               The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him
               flat. No foul.
               
               Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones.
               
               UTOPIA
               It's that weird guy again.
               
               Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit...
               
               Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when
               suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands!
               
               JAMAAL
               Snake! Shot clock!
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2...
               
               A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at
               Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly...
               
               Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn
               sounds just as it leaves his hand...
               
               THE BASKET
               
               Swish. Nothing but net.
               
               The Korean Dragons sit back down, put away their rifles,
               disappointed. Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their henchmen
               quickly leave. The Black Muslims go crazy, and Plissken dashes
               toward one of the exits. He stops, sees...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               With his portable radio, trying to get out of the arena, hiding
               behind a crowd of Dragons. Plissken races through the crowd, grabs
               Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Snake, man... Great shot!
               
               Without hesitation, Snake whacks him across the jaw. Map To The
               Stars Eddie goes down like a sack of laundry. Plissken grabs him
               by the collar, drags him off toward an exit...
               

               EXT. FORUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their men rush out to the
               caravan of waiting vehicles. Xi-Ping has his own armada of
               vehicles and an army of evil-looking guards. Cuervo Jones pulls
               Xi-Ping aside.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               That man in black. He's very dangerous.
               
               XI-PING
               One eye?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Yes. We gotta dump him.
               
               XI-PING
               What does he want?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (glances at the prototype)
               I'm betting the cops sent him in. Man, I
               do not need this. I got a war to win.
               
               ANOTHER EXIT - THE FORUM
               
               As Plissken drags Map To The Stars Eddie out into the night,
               crouches behind a row of cars, watches Cuervo Jones' caravan start
               their engines.
               
               Plissken shakes Map To The Stars Eddie, waking him...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where are they going?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (groggy)
               Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me,
               Snake. I can help you.
               
               Plissken shoves the barrel of his pistol up against Map To The
               Stars Eddie's temple.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Bankrupt City. The Happy Kingdom.
               (beat)
               Snake, Cuervo's hooked up with Xi-Ping. He
               is primetime, man - Mister Bad News. The
               rest of the city's joining up with 'em.
               (beat)
               You're shit outta luck, Snake.
               
               Plissken reaches into a pocket, comes out with the large black
               clip, slips it on his 9mm pistol.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Not yet.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I could've helped you. We coulda made a
               deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
               
               Without looking, Plissken slams his elbow into Map To The Stars
               Eddie's jaw with a WHACK! He flops unconscious on the pavement...
               
               Cuervo Jones' caravan led by that huge Cadillac on monster wheels,
               moves away from the Forum toward an exit. Plissken moves after
               them, ducking behind the row of cars...
               
               FORUM EXIST
               
               The caravan picks up speed as it approaches the exit...
               
               Plissken appears behind an old truck, just as the Cadillac moves
               past him. He crouches on the balls of his feet, and as the rear of
               the Caddy drifts closer, he springs...
               
               And grabs on to the rear bumper. The monster wheels spin like
               huge, black scythes on either side of him. Plissken reaches under
               the Caddy, finds a purchase on the undercarriage, and swings under
               the Cadillac. He hangs dangling above the street by one hand as
               the caravan pulls out onto Manchester. With the other he raises
               his 9mm and aims it at the undercarriage, right about where the
               front seat should be...
               
               BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM!
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               The front seat explodes, bullets screaming upward through the
               leather seats, tearing and shredding fabric and flesh, killing the
               driver and Xi-Ping instantly!
               
               In the back seat sit Cuervo Jones and Utopia. The Caddy begins to
               swerve, the wheel spinning. Cuervo Jones lunges forward across the
               seat and grabs it.
               
               Under the Cadillac, Plissken continues to fire: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM,
               BLAM!
               
               The front seat disintegrates. Metal, leather, padding fly
               everywhere. Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face
               with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other.
               
               KAWHUMP!
               
               The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the
               Cadillac and hit the street below. The bodies of the driver and X-
               Ping flop under the monster wheels.
               
               Plissken swings over to the hole and pulls himself up into the
               opening that used to be the front seat. Cuervo Jones stares at him
               in total shock, but before he can speak...
               
               Plissken rips the prototype out of his hands! Then jumps into the
               back seat next to Utopia. Then grabs her and turns to the side
               door. Cuervo Jones releases the wheel for a moment, turns to grab
               Plissken...
               
               But Plissken opens the side door, kicks it wide, and with Utopia
               under his arm, slides across the seat...
               
               ... and sails out of the Cadillac...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               No!
               
               Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on
               top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly.
               Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the
               Caddy... but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams
               into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a
               hot dog stand.
               
               ON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR
               
               Plissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her,
               and she fights him tooth and nail...
               
               UTOPIA
               Lemme go...!
               
               INSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR
               
               The driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb,
               slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber.
               
               PLISSKEN AND UTOPIA
               
               Are thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood...
               and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop,
               as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the
               caravan suddenly puts on its brakes.
               
               Screaming tires. Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic
               collision...
               
               Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac.
               
               Plissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole
               in the street, pries it up...
               
               Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges
               into the street, pointing at Plissken...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Kill him, kill him...!
               
               Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole
               opening, and dives inside... just as the Mescalitos open fire! The
               street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot
               lead...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets
               to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through
               the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them...
               

               EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE
               
               Cuervo Jones and the Mescalitos charge the open manhole as Map To
               The Stars Eddie appears groggily shuffling up the street from the
               Forum...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (grins to himself)
               Good thinkin', Snake.
               
               He heads off down the street...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL
               
               Plissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has
               to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy
               drain away from the main tunnel...
               

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
               
               The black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move
               along, slow as they come to...
               
               THE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF
               
               One side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our
               journey with Pendejo Bob.
               
               Plissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop-
               off, his eye burning into her...
               
               Her feet reach the very edge.
               
               Plissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror.
               She gulps air in staccato bursts...
               
               Beat. Beat.
               
               Plissken can't do it. He can't push her off.
               
               He releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one
               of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims...
               
               UTOPIA
               My... father sent you... didn't he?
               (beat)
               He sent you to kill me...
               
               Plissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights.
               
               UTOPIA
               Didn't he?
               (begins to cry)
               
               But Plissken can't. He can't kill her. The toughest man on planet
               Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Shit.
               
               Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares
               at her.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Get out of here.
               
               Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I said go!
               
               Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away
               down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken. She stares at
               the prototype in Plissken's hand...
               
               UTOPIA
               Don't take it back. Don't give it to him.
               Please. Let me have it.
               
               Plissken glances at the prototype, then at her.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What does this thing do?
               
               UTOPIA
               (her eyes grow wide)
               No!
               
               KABLAM!
               
               Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh!
               He spins, drops the prototype...
               
               ... as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the
               sewer tunnel. He holds a gun in one hand, aims...
               
               KABLAM!
               
               He fires again, hits Plissken's leg.
               
               Plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off, as Map
               To The Stars Eddie moves quickly forward...
               
               ... and snatches the prototype from the wet floor.
               
               Plissken's gun hand is useless, numb from the shoulder wound. He
               slowly, painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand, tries to
               raise it...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               So long, Snake.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot ...
               
               Plissken spins, and dives off the edge...
               
               ... down into the drop off...
               
               PLISSKEN'S BODY
               
               Airborne. Falling through black space. Down, down, down, straight
               to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness
               swallows him up...
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie steps to the ledge, looks down, as Cuervo
               Jones and his Mescalitos slog up through the tunnel.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where is he?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               He jumped. Down there.
               (beat)
               He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed
               Plissken.
               
               Cuervo Jones looks over the edge, at the silent blackness below.
               Then he turns to Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Give it to me.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You said I could be Vice-President,
               Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (extends his hand)
               Give it.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it
               all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your
               girl back, I got it all. Just for you,
               Cuervo. Just for you.
               
               Dead silence. Cuervo Jones stands with his hand extended. Finally
               Map To The Stars Eddie gives up, starts to hand Cuervo the
               prototype...
               
               ... but slips on the wet floor...
               
               ... and drops the prototype with a CLANK!
               
               CLOSE - PROTOTYPE
               
               A red light comes on, blinks urgently.
               
               PROTOTYPE VOICE
               (tiny, filtered)
               I am now armed and ready for use. Use
               extreme caution. The location of the
               effected blast area can only be determined
               by the orbital position of the SatStar
               Ring.
               
               Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move. Slowly Cuervo
               Jones picks up the prototype, stares at it, then breaks into a
               smile...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               This is turning out to be my lucky day.
               (stares coldly at Map To The
               Stars Eddie)
               Get this asshole outta here.
               
               Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie, pull him back
               along the tunnel.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo, wait. Please...
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the
               drop-off. He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously,
               across the face.
               
               Utopia reacts to the stinging slap.
               
               UTOPIA
               Cuervo...?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're my woman, you understand? You don't
               let anybody take you away from me without
               a fight.
               
               UTOPIA
               I tried...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (in her face)
               Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you
               give your life. You fight till you're
               dead. Then I forgive you.
               (screams)
               Understand?
               (shakes her)
               Understand?
               
               UTOPIA
               Yes...
               
               He shoves her down the tunnel...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Let's go.
               
               The others follow them...
               

               EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE - NIGHT
               
               As Cuervo Jones and Utopia emerge from the manhole cover, hear the
               sound of hundreds of helicopters rise.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (looks up)
               Look, baby. They're all mine.
               
               POV - THE SKY
               
               Above Manchester and the Forum is filled with helicopters. All
               models, all makes, mostly the older, discarded military Blood
               Phoenix 14-bladed attack choppers that scream through the
               blackness like scythe-slashing robot bugs. They are on their way
               southeast, toward Orange County.
               

               EXT. SKY VIEW OF L.A. BY NIGHT
               
               Looking out at L.A. from above Mount Lee, see the Hollywood Sign,
               and wave after wave of helicopters thundering across the city.
               
               ANGLE ON THE TWIN TOWERS OF CENTURY CITY
               
               They're like buck teeth, sheered off and crumbling, stuck up in to
               the sky. Chopper roar overhead. A group of vagrants cluster around
               a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers. They're
               watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen TV. The
               sound of the choppers brings them to the edge of the building -
               the walls of the floors beneath have been torn away. Desk,
               furniture, rugs, everything hangs out over the empty space.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
               
               Pandemonium. Troops, vehicles, helicopters, everything is in
               urgent motion. A loudspeaker voice blares:
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               Full stage battle alert. All personnel to
               battle stations.
               

               INT. HALLWAY INTO COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President and Brazen charge down a hallway into
               Command HQ. The place is jumping. Full scramble alert.
               
               MALLOY
               A sky full of enemy choppers on radar.
               Moving over the city to the southeast.
               
               A COM Officer rushes up to Malloy...
               
               COM OFFICER
               Commander - massive vehicle and troop
               movement on the ground. All major streets
               leading to the southeast.
               
               PRESIDENT
               What're they doing?
               
               Malloy looks at the President grimly.
               
               MALLOY
               Getting ready to invade.
               
               PRESIDENT
               (beat)
               So where's Plissken?
               
               DARKNESS
               
               Creaking. The WHOOSH of something swinging through the air...
               
               A huge blue eye opens. Looks around.
               
               DARKNESS
               
               Plissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh...
               
               DARKNESS
               
               And then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long
               strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness.
               
               Plissken's eye blinks.
               
               THE DARKNESS
               
               Begins to reveal details: slimy walls. Below, a black pit of hell.
               Wind gushing.
               
               And then a light stabs across the void...
               
               CLOSE - PLISSKEN
               
               ... The light hits Plissken's good eye...
               
               The light is from inside the eye of Pendejo Bob. He stands on a
               small ledge, at the mouth of a cave leading into the howling pit.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, Snake. You okay?
               (unhooks the lariat)
               I heard gunfire down here...
               (begins to swing the rope)
               Never been down this far before...
               (swings the rope in a huge
               arc)
               Grab this.
               
               Pendejo Bob tosses the lariat. The noose flies across the pit, and
               Plissken grabs it with his good hand.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Now hang on.
               
               Plissken wraps his good hand and arm in the noose, as Pendejo Bob
               jerks the line hard. Plissken is in mid-swing, and the rope
               jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction...
               
               Plissken's boot slips out of the wire mesh...
               
               And Plissken falls like a brick, stops abruptly as the line
               catches, and swings against the side of the pit. He dangles with
               only his one good arm holding on to the rope.
               
               Pendejo Bob pulls the line upward, straining against Plissken's
               weight. Slowly Plissken rises, a tug at a time, hauled up the edge
               of the pit toward the cave above...
               
               ... when suddenly he passes another opening, a storm drain below
               Pendejo Bob. He swings into the drain, grasps the side with his
               hand, and pulls himself in...
               
               Pendejo Bob stares down at his rope disappearing into the side of
               the pit.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, Snake...where are you?
               
               Plissken crawls into the slimy drain, pulls the rope off of him.
               Ahead in the darkness is the rushing of water. He turns on weak
               legs, back toward the pit behind him. Bleeding. Numb in one hand.
               His leg on fire.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (yells)
               I'm in another opening... Storm drain...
               There may be another way up to you...
               
               Plissken crawls along the drain. The sound of rushing water gets
               louder.
               
               He comes to the edge of the drain. Right below him is another
               drain filled with water rushing through it like a river.
               
               Plissken is stuck. He turns, in great pain, and starts back toward
               the pit... when suddenly everything starts shaking. Booming. It's
               a small earthquake, a pre-shock.
               
               SNAP!
               
               Suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way, cracks,
               disintegrates...
               
               And Plissken falls backward into the rushing water, and is pulled
               suddenly downstream into the drain, disappearing from sight...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               
               Stands silently above, listening...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Snake...
               (no reply)
               Snake!
               
               Booming. The whole pit shudders, shaking. Another earthquake.
               Pendejo Bob drops the rope, turns and dashes away down the
               vibrating storm drain...
               

               EXT. STORM DRAIN - WILSHIRE CANYON - NIGHT
               
               Black oil-slicked water rushes in the moonlight, out of a huge
               opening in what appears to be a canyon wall.
               
               CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE DRAIN
               
               As an arm shoots out, clutching the edges of the drain.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Emerges from the hole, slides out, tumbles down to a water-filled
               canyon bottom. He lies there for a moment, trying to focus his
               eye. Stabbing pain in his shoulder and leg. Finally he rises
               unsteadily to his feet, looks around, trying to get his bearings.
               He finds himself at the bottom of...
               
               THE WILSHIRE CANYON
               
               Straight down Wilshire Boulevard is an enormous canyon, a river
               bottom gouged out of concrete in the big earthquake. At least 30
               feet deep, it is a vast trough leading past skyscrapers and
               buildings above, off into the distance.
               
               Plissken warily glances at his watch: 1 hour 10 minutes to go.
               
               Suddenly Plissken is struck by a pair of headlights. Pipeline's
               dune buggy comes bumping along the canyon bottom, sloshing through
               water, pulling up next to Plissken.
               
               PIPELINE
               Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great
               shot.
               (stares at him)
               You look like shit.
               
               Plissken hobbles over to the dune buggy as Pipeline gets out.
               
               PIPELINE
               You feel those pre-shocks, Snake?
               
               Pipeline unties the various surfboards he has lashed to the rear
               of the buggy. He lifts one down and slings it under his arm.
               
               PIPELINE
               Could be a big one comin' any minute
               now...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
               
               PIPELINE
               Long gone. You'll never catch up with him
               now, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where?
               
               PIPELINE
               Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The
               whole town's gonna be there. Things
               changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not
               the same as the old days, man.
               
               A thumping sound skyward. More choppers thunder over them, on
               their way southeast. Plissken grabs Pipeline with his good hand...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Take me there...
               
               But he's too weak. His hand slides off. Plissken sinks to his
               knees. Pipeline stares at him.
               
               PIPELINE
               You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need
               help.
               (bends down, helps Plissken
               to his feet)
               You should talk to Hershe. She hates
               Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they
               split up.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               PIPELINE
               Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo
               Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that
               way.
               
               Pipeline points down the canyon to the east.
               
               PIPELINE
               She's connected with the Black Cowboys,
               and they don't take shit from nobody...
               
               Suddenly that booming, shuddering rumble begins. The canyon starts
               to shake. The water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly.
               
               PIPELINE
               Yo', man. It's a big one.
               
               And the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer. The walls of
               the canyon crack. Plissken and Pipeline are thrown to the ground.
               
               Skyscrapers above them on Wilshire rock and tremble in the quake.
               Pieces of the building sheer off, fall. A parking garage caves in.
               
               Thunder shakes the earth around Plissken and Pipeline. The canyon
               floor splits open. Water pours into the cracks. Huge boulder-sized
               chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls.
               
               And then suddenly it all stops.
               
               The booming subsides. The earth stops shaking. Plissken and
               Pipeline get to their feet, look around. The water around them
               continues to slosh about violently.
               
               PIPELINE
               Tsunami, Snake.
               
               His eyes wide, a smile on his face, Pipeline hurries over to the
               dune buggy, grabs another surfboard from the back, hands it to
               Plissken.
               
               PIPELINE
               Surf's up big time.
               
               Now there is another deep sound rising, coming from the west
               behind them: A bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom
               of the register upward, as if some massive wall of doom were on
               its way...
               
               Pipeline kneels, positions his surfboard in his hands.
               
               PIPELINE
               Get ready, Snake. It's gonna be some kinda
               ride.
               
               Plissken looks behind him...
               
               POV - THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TSUNAMI
               
               Is blasting down the Wilshire Canyon, coming right for them. It is
               a 25-foot wall of ocean water, moving fast, bellowing like a
               thunderclap.
               
               Plissken sees he can't climb out of the canyon in time, moves over
               to Pipeline, kneels down...
               
               PIPELINE
               Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get
               on your board till it peaks.
               
               Behind them, the tsunami slams along the canyon, coming right for
               them.
               
               PIPELINE
               Don't lose it, man. You slip off your
               board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know
               what I mean?
               
               The roaring is so loud it's like being on the inside of a cannon
               barrel. The tsunami is 100 feet away... 75 feet... 50 feet... 25
               feet... It rolls up right behind them...
               
               PIPELINE
               Hang on, Snake!
               (yells)
               YAAAAAAA!!!!
               
               THE FRONT EDGE
               
               Of the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off
               from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a
               cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they
               disappear under the blackness...
               
               Until suddenly Pipeline pops up on top of the tsunami, riding on
               his surfboard, arms outstretched, feet braced.
               
               And then Plissken pops up beside him, surfing clumsily on top of
               the tsunami wave, kneeling on his surfboard.
               
               They blast down Wilshire Canyon at 80 miles an hour. Plissken is
               wobbly on the surfboard, but he manages to stay on top of the
               wave. Finally, he gets the hang of it, glances over at Pipeline,
               who grins from ear to ear.
               
               PIPELINE
               Awesome, Snake. AWESOME, man!
               
               Plissken looks up ahead...
               
               HIS POV - MOVING THROUGH WILSHIRE CANYON
               
               Five feet from street level. An old van speeds along what's left
               of Wilshire Boulevard, right on the canyon's edge. It veers around
               debris in the street, changes lanes suddenly, hell bent for
               leather.
               
               Plissken and Pipeline move closer and closer to the van as the
               tsunami sweeps them along.
               
               Now they move alongside the van and Plissken stares over...
               
               CLOSER - THE VAN
               
               Behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie, driving like a
               lunatic, his teeth bared and set, madder than shit.
               
               Plissken's eye widens, burns.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (to Pipeline)
               See you later.
               
               And suddenly Plissken shifts his weight, and the surfboard tips
               and slides sideways, across the surface of the tsunami all the way
               over to the edge, right next to the van. Map To The Stars Eddie
               glances to his left...
               
               HIS POV - PLISSKEN
               
               Is surfing the tsunami not 10 feet away from him.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie stares in absolute horror. Plissken tips
               the board again, and slides another 5 feet closer...
               
               AS MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               Jams the pedal, and the van screams forward...
               
               AS PLISSKEN
               
               Stands up and leaps from the surfboard...
               
               For a moment he is airborne, leaping across the gap to the van...
               and slams into the side of the van. He grabs on to the roof, hangs
               on with one hand, his body whipping against the rocking, bucking
               side. Map To The Stars Eddie starts swerving, trying to throw
               Plissken off.
               

               EXT. VAN - WILSHIRE BOULEVARD
               
               The van shoots back and forth across Wilshire, Plissken dangling
               inches from the tsunami-filled canyon. Plissken pulls himself up
               and crawls onto the roof...
               
               INSIDE THE VAN
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie pulls his gun, cocks it...
               
               When suddenly Plissken's hand snakes down from the roof, reaches
               in the driver's window, grabs his hair, and slams his forehead
               into the steering wheel with a THOCK!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie goes out like a light. He slumps over in
               the seat... but his foot is stuck on the accelerator.
               
               Plissken grabs the wheel with his left hand, and manages to steer
               the van from the roof. The van lurches wildly, hits a chunk of
               concrete in the street, skids, fishtailing violently from the
               impact. It smashes against the curb, screeches and bumps along
               concrete.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie's foot is bumped right off the accelerator,
               and the van slows to a wobbling, grinding stop.
               
               Plissken slowly climbs down from the roof, opens the driver's
               door, shoves Map To The Stars Eddie out of the way, and jumps in.
               

               INT. VAN - NIGHT
               
               Plissken pulls out into the street and speeds off down Wilshire.
               Map To The Stars Eddie starts to come around.
               
               Plissken grabs his gun, cocks it, puts the barrel up against Map
               To The Stars Eddie's temple just as he comes to.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Listen up. I need directions. Downtown.
               Somebody named Hershe.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Sure, Snake. No problem.
               (groggy)
               You gonna kill me?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Later.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot
               you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God,
               man.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Cease fire with the bullshit.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks
               down, turn right.
               
               CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN
               
               Cuervo Jones' image fills the screen. He addresses the camera,
               holds the prototype in his hands.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours. Have
               the news media standing by for my
               coronation. I'm arriving in style.
               
               PULL BACK from the TV screen to reveal we are in...
               

               INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President, Brazen, and the other Controllers and
               Police Personnel stare silently at their TV screens.
               
               BRAZEN
               He must be bouncing the signal from one of
               our communications satellites.
               
               PRESIDENT
               That means CableNet has already picked it
               up. This thing's going live all over the
               country.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (on the TV)
               It's a brand new day comin' up this
               morning, and I'm just so proud to be
               leading the parade. See you soon, putos.
               
               SSSZZZ. The image blinks off into static.
               
               A grim silence.
               
               MALLOY
               The prototype appears to be armed, Mr.
               President.
               (the President nods grimly)
               Shall I begin evacuation?
               
               PRESIDENT
               Does he know how to activate it?
               
               MALLOY
               Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the
               button.
               
               BRAZEN
               What about Plissken? He could still be -
               
               PRESIDENT
               Forget him. He's dead.
               
               MALLOY
               That may not be true, Mr. President.
               (beat)
               He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead
               so many times I can't count. But he never
               stays down.
               
               A long beat.
               
               MALLOY
               There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait
               for Plissken, or surrender. It's your
               decision.
               
               The President sighs heavily.
               

               EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT
               
               Jammed next to the remains of the Bonaventure Hotel is the Queen
               Mary, permanently dry-docked between the broken skyscrapers by the
               Big One.
               
               The van stops next to a huge hole in the side of the ship.
               

               INT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT
               
               The glow of Map To The Stars Eddie's flashlight takes him and
               Plissken deeper and deeper into the hulking remains of the ship.
               

               INT. DECK OF SHOPS - NIGHT
               
               They walk through a dimly lighted area lined with shops. Their
               glass display windows are covered with layers of impenetrable
               dirt.
               

               INT. LONG CORRIDOR - NIGHT
               
               They enter a long, narrow corridor. At the end is a doorway. There
               is light in the room beyond.
               

               INT. VICTORIAN SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie enter a long room lit by gas
               jets on the walls. In it is a crumbling, Victorian swimming pool.
               A heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over
               everything.
               
               At the far end is a group of people. Spinal and the Black Cowboy
               Gang. Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns.
               
               Mojo Dellasandro. Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor. A brutal, scowling
               face. And a beautiful woman in a bathing suit, her back facing us.
               
               Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Hershe. How're you doin'?
               
               The woman turns and faces them. This is HERSHE, an absolutely
               drop-dead, gorgeous transvestite who looks completely convincing
               as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice.
               
               SPINAL
               (eyes brightening)
               Hershe - it's Snake Plissken.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Yeah, Hershe. I brought him to see you.
               
               Plissken walks right up to Hershe, has no reaction at all to the
               transvestite.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I need a favor.
               
               HERSHE
               What's in it for me?
               
               Plissken stares, a glimmer of recognition on his face.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Wait a minute. I know that voice.
               (beat)
               You're Carjack Malone.
               
               HERSHE
               Not anymore.
               
               SPINAL
               You two know each other?
               
               Plissken is seething. Hershe remains calm, glacial.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You owe me. You left me holdin' everything
               back there in Cleveland.
               
               SPINAL
               (astounded)
               Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
               
               HERSHE
               I was called away on urgent business,
               Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't lie to me.
               
               HERSHE
               All right, so I made another deal.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I got a new deal for you.
               
               Plissken raises Map To The Stars Eddie's gun, aims it right
               between Hershe's eyes.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You help me, you live.
               
               The others tense, hands on guns.
               
               SPINAL
               I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
               
               HERSHE
               We have a little arrangement. Anything
               happens to me, you're dead.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm already dead.
               
               HERSHE
               (long beat)
               I see your point. What's the favor?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (looks at his watch)
               Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the
               Kingdom. I got one hour.
               
               HERSHE
               Dream on, blue eye.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Say goodnight, Carjack.
               
               Plissken cocks his gun, starts to squeeze the trigger...
               
               HERSHE
               Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
               
               SPINAL
               Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two
               armies. No one gets near him.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And he's got the prototype. And the girl.
               He holds all the cards.
               
               HERSHE
               Exactly what is this prototype? What does
               it do?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You push the button, it sends a signal to
               a ring of space defense satellites.
               They're orbiting bombs. Nukes. They
               explode. Huge space burst.
               (beat)
               EMP. Electromagnetic Pulse. It happens
               instantly when a nuke is airburst. EMP
               shuts down every power source below the
               satellites - instantly. All electrical
               devices, computers, cars, airplanes,
               cities. It's the dark ages again.
               
               HERSHE
               So whoever has it runs the show.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               They were gonna use it on South America,
               Africa, Asia - any country hostile to the
               United States.
               
               SPINAL
               Only Cuervo's got it now.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And that ring of satellites will be in
               position over the U.S. at 5:00 a.m. this
               morning.
               
               PLISSKEN
               How do you know all this?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I used to represent the guy who invented
               it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
               
               A long silence.
               
               HERSHE
               So what's the deal, gorgeous?
               
               PLISSKEN
               We get the girl and the prototype. And we
               get out.
               
               SPINAL
               All of us?

               We'll see.
               
               HERSHE
               Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we
               gonna go? What's the payoff?
               
               SPINAL
               I'd like to get out but I don't have
               enough money.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The President's promised to give whoever
               helps me 1 million dollars.
               
               SPINAL
               Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of
               them.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
               
               This gets everyone's attention.

               Aw, come on, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear

               You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones

               No, that sucks.

               How are we getting out?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I don't know yet.

               You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin'
               things up as you go along. That's why I
               cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a
               bum like the rest of us.
               
               Smoke has begun to drift into the pool area.
               
               MOJO DELLASANDRO
               (a soft voice)
               Use the air.
               
               They look at him.
               
               MOJO DELLASANDRO
               They're burning. Santa Anas. The night
               wind.
               
               SPINAL
               What're you talking about, Mojo?
               
               MOJO DELLASANDRO
               Death from above...
               

               EXT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, Hershe, Map To The Stars Eddie, Spinal and the Black
               Cowboy Gang stand on the top deck of the Queen Mary. Mojo
               Dellasandro straps each man into his own hang glider rig. The wind
               whips around them. The hillsides in the distance are on fire.
               
               They look like strange oversized moths lined up on the edge of the
               deck. The wind picks up Map To The Stars Eddie's rig. He bumps up
               and down, side to side, buffeted wildly until Mojo Dellasandro
               brings him back down to the decking.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I don't know about this thing.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't like it, don't come.
               
               SPINAL
               Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
               
               HERSHE
               My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you
               understand, cowboy?
               
               As Mojo Dellasandro passes out various weapons to the men, Map To
               The Stars Eddie leans over to Plissken, their hang glider rigs
               thumping clumsily into each other. Eddie holds up that small,
               metal-plated portable radio he was carrying when we first met him.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I got an idea, Snake.
               (shows Plissken the radio)
               This looks like the prototype, right?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah, kinda.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on
               Cuervo.
               
               PLISSKEN
               If he lets you get close enough.
               
               HERSHE
               The wind's up. Let's go.
               
               The men brace themselves. Map To The Stars Eddie looks like he
               wants to die.
               
               Hershe looks over at Plissken and grins.
               
               HERSHE
               See you in hell, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without
               me.
               
               With that Plissken launches himself off the deck, sailing out over
               open space, then down toward the street...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Gliding through the air, as the wind picks him upward. He arcs
               away from the street level, up toward the remains of the downtown
               skyscrapers. Behind him, one after another, the group takes off
               into the wind, diving, rising with the wind.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie makes a rapid suicidal dive right down
               toward the pavement below. He screams like a madman until the wind
               lifts him at the last possible second.
               

               EXT. TOPS OF SKYSCRAPERS - NIGHT
               
               The group of hang gliders sweep past the buildings. A bracero
               family is having dinner by candlelight two feet from the edge of a
               sheer precipice, as the side of the skyscraper they live in has
               been torn off. They wave to Plissken as he passes.
               
               Two floors down, someone has hooked up huge speakers and a
               croaking male voice is singing a Barbra Streisand hit to a
               background track.
               
               A beautiful girl in a sheer diaphanous gown dances far out on a
               narrow girder, waving a scarf at the moon.
               
               Plissken and the others now fly in formation, like avenging bats
               through the night, except for Map To The Stars Eddie who keeps
               rising and plunging violently, barely in control.
               

               EXT. DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
               
               An army of vehicles and people pour into Disneyland - but it's a
               Disneyland gone to hell. A huge sign reads: "THE HAPPY KINGDOM"
               
               The gates no longer exist. The overhead tram lies broken on the
               ground. Slowly vehicles drive straight inside...
               
               A battered old limousine carries Cuervo Jones and a grim-looking
               Utopia past the ruins of the train and around the ghost-town
               square of Main Street. Ahead is the fairy castle, broken and
               crumbling, like some relic from a nightmare. Around it are the
               thrill rides, tossed in to a jumbled mass by the force of the
               original earthquake.
               
               Crowds are waiting. Gangs of every conceivable description. Ethic
               gangs. Female gangs. Gangs of children. Also families with
               hangers-on. As soon as the limousine appears, the crowds begin
               cheering.
               

               INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones stares out at the masses.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               They're simple people. They love a party.
               (turns to Utopia)
               We're gonna throw them one hell of a party
               when we get to America. Right?
               
               Utopia is silent, sullen. Cuervo raises his hand to her and she
               jumps, cowering.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Put a smile on your face.
               
               A terrified smile spreads across Utopia's face.
               

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
               
               As the limousine inches down Main Street, suddenly a wall of
               headlights pop on. 100 or so battered old vintage Chevys rev their
               engines, begin bouncing up and down wildly on hydraulic lifts.
               Gangs begin cheering, firing their weapons into the air like New
               Year's Eve.
               
               At the end of Main Street is a huge open area - almost an arena,
               beyond which are parked a literal army of helicopters.
               
               As the limousine stops, and Cuervo Jones emerges, Utopia on his
               arm, the cheering begins, a wall of sound through the park. Three
               Black Muslims step out to greet Cuervo, dressed in turban-like
               headgear and sunglasses, wearing black capes and carrying old
               Thompson machine guns. They stop, give the right-handed power
               salute. One of them, BIVOUAC, speaks to Cuervo.
               
               BIVOUAC
               Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to the crowd, extends his arms.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Are you ready for the New World?
               
               And the loudest, longest cheer you've ever heard goes up.
               

               EXT. SKIES ABOVE DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and the group sail through the sky like silent avenging
               angels toward Disneyland below them and several miles away.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Glances at his wrist watch. Only 20 minutes left. Map To The Stars
               Eddie swings wildly over in his direction, manages to stabilize
               his glider for a few moments.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Is that what I think it is?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Yeah. The place kept changing owners.
               Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris
               killed 'em.
               
               Hershe and Spinal sweep over next to Plissken and fly in close
               formation.
               
               HERSHE
               Snake. We need some kind of diversion.
               
               A beat later all of them look over at Map To The Stars Eddie.
               

               EXT. MAIN STREET - THE ARENA - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones leads Utopia toward a large attack helicopter out in
               front of all the others. The choppers are all starting up,
               roaring, blades turning.
               
               Suddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming, yelling, Map
               To The Stars Eddie diving out of control, eyes wide as he passes
               Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo. Hey, man, I made it! I made it!
               Wait for me...
               
               KAWHUMP!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food
               restaurant - KACRUNCH!
               
               A beat or so later he staggers out of the rig, dizzy and confused.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey Cuervo...
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to Bivouac.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Would you please kill him for me?
               
               BIVOUAC
               My pleasure.
               
               Bivouac raises his machine gun...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo, wait! I got news. There's about to
               be an attack.
               
               Cuervo holds up his hand, stopping Bivouac. Everyone tenses. Map
               To The Stars Eddie races over...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's
               Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You told me he was dead.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I thought he was, but he came back.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where?
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie moves close to Cuervo, out of breath,
               looking like he may faint...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Oh Cuervo...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (long beat)
               What?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (stalling)
               It's so good to see you again.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where's Plissken?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               He's... near.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're stalling, Eddie.
               (grabs him)
               Talk, you little gringo!
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (eyes wide)
               Cuervo, look out behind you!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to protect him,
               and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in Cuervo's hand.
               At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open fire on an
               old storefront behind Cuervo Jones. The place is shredded.
               
               Cuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the ground, and
               grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You've lied to me for the very last time.
               
               Cuervo Jones pulls out a pistol, cocks it, aims at Map To The
               Stars Eddie's face...
               
               KABLOOM! No, not the pistol. A huge explosion rocks Main Street.
               
               WHOOSH! Suddenly out of the night sky Spinal and the Black Cowboys
               dive right down across Main Street.
               
               KABLAM! Another explosion sends everyone scurrying for cover.
               
               Spinal pulls the pin on a grenade, throws it...
               
               BLAMM! BLOOM! Explosions erupt everywhere!
               
               Cuervo Jones grabs Utopia, turns to run toward to the lead
               helicopter when...
               
               Plissken roars down out of the sky and his him full force. Cuervo,
               Plissken and the hang glider go tumbling and crashing in a heap.
               
               SERIES OF FAST CUTS:
               
               Chaos and pandemonium. Hershe dives down over the gangs, ripping
               hellfire from his automatic rifle.
               
               People running. Explosions.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie grabs Utopia.
               
               Plissken and Cuervo Jones get to their feet and have at it!
               
               Through flames and running people Plissken and Cuervo battle.
               
               In Cuervo's hand is a long black knife. Just as he's plunging it,
               Plissken steps aside and grabs him. Locked together, they battle
               savagely.
               
               The knife cuts Plissken's chest.
               
               Cuervo moves for Plissken's throat.
               
               Plissken smashes him in the face.
               
               They both grip the knife in a deadlock.
               
               From above, Spinal dives down and hurls a grenade. Cuervo and
               Plissken disappear in a huge flash of fire and smoke as the
               grenade erupts out of the pavement nearby.
               
               When the smoke clears, three things are on the ground. Plissken.
               Cuervo Jones. The prototype.
               
               Instantly Plissken and Cuervo dive for the prototype. Plissken has
               it, kicks Cuervo in the face, drags himself to his feet and takes
               off running (as fast as a man can run with one bullet in his leg)
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie drags Utopia toward the lead helicopter, as
               Hershe comes in for a landing.
               
               Spinal comes in for a landing, continues to throw grenades. The
               other Black Cowboys land, provide covering fire.
               
               Plissken races for the chopper. Behind him, Cuervo Jones is on his
               feet and in pursuit.
               
               Hershe opens fire at Cuervo. Cuervo dives behind a smoking,
               burning Chevy.
               

               INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT
               
               As everyone scrambles in. A Black Cowboy is hit by gunfire, slides
               down the bulkhead and out the door.
               
               Plissken jumps in the left seat, takes the controls. Utopia and
               Map To The Stars Eddie both climb in the right seat together. The
               others are in the back, firing back at the gangs. Plissken pulls
               in power.
               
               CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE
               
               The needle's at 100% plus. Full power.
               

               EXT. LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               The lead chopper shudders, trying to get off the ground. Gunfire
               continues.
               

               INT. HELICOPTER
               
               The ship shakes violently.
               
               PLISSKEN
               She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
               
               HERSHE
               (screams from the rear
               compartment)
               Somebody get off!
               
               SPINAL
               (glares at him)
               Who?
               
               All eyes quickly move to Map To The Stars Eddie...
               
               KABLAM!
               
               Bullets rip through the windscreen.
               
               POV - AN ARMY OF GANGS
               
               Is moving, through the smoke, charging the ship!
               

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               The ship trembles. Plissken moves his feet, jams in the left tail-
               rotor pedal all the way.
               

               EXT. THE LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               Rotates, turns around 180 degrees on the ground, pushed by the
               tail rotor force.
               
               THE CYCLIC CONTROL
               
               As Plissken inches it forward...
               
               THE HELICOPTER
               
               Begins sliding across the ground, skids grinding along the
               pavement, sparks flying - slowly at first, now picking up speed...
               
               In the cockpit, the ship lurches and jumps and slams! Everyone is
               bounced around.
               
               The helicopter moves fast now - faster -
               
               LOW ANGLE ON THE SKIDS
               
               As they rise up, an inch off the ground - then two inches - then a
               foot -
               
               Cuervo Jones emerges from the smoke, running ahead of the other
               gangs, barreling toward the ever-so-slowly rising chopper...
               
               THE LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               As it lifts - five feet - climbing...
               
               The helicopter pulls away from the charging gangs and Cuervo's
               sprinting figure.
               
               POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN
               
               See the Matterhorn ahead, coming closer and closer. Hershe leans
               out the door.
               
               HERSHE
               We're not gonna make it over the fuckin'
               mountain!
               
               The helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15
               feet... 10... Plissken tries to maneuver out of the way... 8
               feet... 5...
               
               The helicopter wobbles over the top of the mountain, the right
               skid catching on the Matterhorn's edge! A horrible cracking sound,
               and the right skid is ripped off from its front mounting, hanging
               half off the ship!
               
               On the ground, Cuervo Jones jumps into one of the waiting
               helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off
               into the sky. Finally Cuervo's chopper lifts off...
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
               
               An alarm horn sounds. Everyone is on the move.
               

               INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               A crowd surrounds a computer screen with a small green blip moving
               over a grid of L.A.
               
               COM OFFICER
               Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It's
               passed into restricted space, heading this
               way.
               
               Malloy, the President, and Brazen exchange glances.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Is it Plissken?
               
               Nobody knows.
               
               COM OFFICER
               Commander, I'm getting radio contact with
               the aircraft.
               
               MALLOY
               Boost it.
               
               The COM Officer flips a switch, and we hear Plissken's voice
               booming through HQ.
               
               PLISSKEN (V.O.)
               Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Thank God.
               
               MALLOY
               (grabs a radio mike)
               Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the
               prototype?
               

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               PLISSKEN
               (into his radio)
               Yeah, I got it.
               
               Plissken glances at the transistor radio in his hand, shoves it in
               his boot, reaches his hand out to Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               PLISSKE
               (to Map To The Stars Eddie)
               Now give me the real one.
               
               Utopia stares into Plissken's eye.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie shrugs innocently
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I couldn't make the switch, Snake. I don't
               have it.
               
               Suddenly Utopia reaches into Map To The Stars Eddie's coat and
               pulls out the real prototype. She hands it to Plissken
               
               UTOPIA
               Now we're even, Snake.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie makes a lunge for it, but Plissken whacks
               him in the face. His head bobs slowly back and forth for a moment,
               then he slumps in the seat.
               

               INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT

               COM OFFICER
               Commander Malloy - he's got lots of
               company.
               
               Malloy and the others look at the computer screen. Plissken's
               green blip is followed by hundreds of other green blips all
               rapidly closing in on him...
               
               MALLOY
               Battle stations...
               
               The room springs into action...
               

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               PLISSKEN
               I think we've burned off enough fuel. We
               may be lighter enough to hover. Just
               barely.
               
               HERSHE
               Can you land?
               
               PLISSKEN
               No. The right skid's broken. If I try to
               set it down she'll crash. I have to stay
               in a hoverwhile you jump off.
               (beat as Plissken looks at
               Utopia)
               Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give
               her your dress.
               
               HERSHE
               (ice cold)
               My name is no longer Carjack. Will you
               please get that through your fucking head?
               
               SPINAL
               Holy shit.
               
               They look, as suddenly the night sky on either side of them is
               filled with gang helicopters!
               

               EXT. SKY OVER THE SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT
               
               The lead helicopter is surrounded by enemy choppers. Above, below,
               on either side.
               
               Right next to Plissken, Cuervo's chopper pulls up just ten feet
               away. Cuervo grins out at Plissken evilly, unhooks himself from
               his seat...
               
               On the other side, another chopper with Bivouac and the Black
               Muslims pull up. In the rear compartment, a Black Muslim aims what
               looks like a huge harpoon gun mounted to the floor.
               
               KAWHAM!
               
               The line shoots out and a gleaming grappling hook slams into the
               side of Plissken's chopper, the prongs clawing in, holding. In the
               lead helicopter, the Black Cowboys, Spinal and Hershe aim their
               weapons.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't shoot! They can drag us down into
               the sea.
               
               Cuervo Jones leaps from the opened door of his chopper, flies
               through space, lands on Plissken's door with a WHUMP! He smashes
               through the side window and grabs Plissken.
               
               KABLAM! KABLAM! Gang choppers open fire, riddling the rear
               compartment with bullets. Spinal and several Black Cowboys are
               hit!
               
               Plissken fights Cuervo through the door.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (to Utopia)
               Take the controls!
               
               Utopia stares at him.
               
               UTOPIA
               What do I do?
               
               But Cuervo wrenches the door open, grabs Plissken, and pulls him
               out of the seat. Utopia grabs the controls.
               
               The lead helicopter goes wild, lurching and swinging and dropping.
               Plissken and Cuervo are locked in a death grip, hanging on to the
               doorway, one foot in, one foot out.
               
               Plissken embraces Cuervo and throws them both over the edge...
               
               They fall through space, locked together, until...
               
               WHAP! They are jolted to a dead stop, swinging in mid-air,
               Plissken's arm wrapped around the dangling right skid.
               
               The lead helicopter bucks and spins and swings, Plissken and
               Cuervo suspended below, struggling to the death, whipped back and
               forth by the helicopter's gyrations.
               
               In the cockpit, Utopia grabs the controls. The ship is shaking,
               swinging like a pendulum. Hershe is hit with gunfire, flops in the
               rear compartment. Map To The Stars Eddie slowly regains
               consciousness, stares in horror at Utopia.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Where's Plissken?
               
               Outside, Cuervo clutches Plissken around the neck, struggling and
               thrashing. Plissken head butts him, dazing him for a second...
               
               KA-CRACK! The dangling skid is breaking loose from its mounting on
               the helicopter above. Plissken and Cuervo Jones stare up, then at
               each other, then both begin pulling themselves up the skid,
               climbing hand over hand, in a desperate race...
               
               Both men reach the bottom of the helicopter and leap across to the
               left skid as the dangling right skid breaks off and falls into the
               San Fernando Sea. Plissken and Cuervo kick at each other. Plissken
               slides away from him, looks up... sees the grappling hook stuck
               into the side of the helicopter...
               
               Plissken swings up, straddling the skid. He reaches up and begins
               prying loose the grappling hook. Cuervo's coming right up behind
               him, reaching for him, a huge knife in his hands. He raises the
               knife - when Map To The Stars Eddie leans out of the cockpit door,
               lowers a gun and aims it right at Cuervo.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Cuervo.
               
               Cuervo looks at him, starts to say something, eyes bulging...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               If you get to America - let's do lunch.
               
               KABLAM! KABLAM! The shots hit, and Cuervo buckles, falls backwards
               off the skid, plunging downward toward the surface of the San
               Fernando Sea... KASPLASH!
               
               Plissken rips out the grappling hook...
               
               AS BOOM!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the
               seat, out of the door, out of the helicopter - plunges to the
               water below.
               
               Plissken jumps back inside the cockpit.
               
               UTOPIA
               Snake, look.
               
               POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN
               
               Police battle helicopters thunder toward them. In unison, the
               police helicopters launch their missiles from gun platforms.
               Burning, white-sulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness
               and hit enemy choppers. The sky around the lead helicopter is
               filled with explosions, waves of rolling fire, falling flaming
               wrecks plunging past, as enemy choppers begin to hit the water.
               
               It is a dreamlike, slow-motion ballet. Huge black police gun ships
               circle lazily around the enemy choppers, their flex-guns and
               rockets spitting blue-white fire. The pound the living hell out of
               the enemy choppers. In f.g. Plissken's helicopter sweeps over the
               wall.
               

               EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President, Brazen and the rest the Firebase watch as
               Plissken's helicopter approaches, then zooms right over Rotor City
               and heads for the distant treeline.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Where the hell is he going?
               

               EXT. SMALL CLEARING - NIGHT
               
               Plissken's helicopter comes in, lower and lower, into a hover five
               feet above the ground. Inside, Plissken pulls in all the power
               he's got.
               
               PLISSKEN
               It's taking all the power we've got to
               hover.
               
               CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE
               
               Shows 100% plus power. The helicopter is in a trembling hover.
               Inside...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Jump out. Head for the treeline and
               disappear.
               
               Utopia stares at him.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Go!
               
               Utopia jumps out of the helicopter... lands on the ground and
               takes off running into the darkness. Inside...
               
               PLISSKEN
               All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me.
               We're gonna land.
               
               Plissken slowly drops the collective control. The left skid sets
               down, and the ship continues to descend, tips, begins to roll.
               Inside, as the chopper rolls over, Plissken braces himself. As the
               blades hit the ground, the chopper goes wild. The fuselage jumps
               and twists in a grinding fury. Smoke and debris fly. The blades
               snap off...
               
               FROM BEHIND PLISSKEN - INSIDE
               
               Looking out the front, the blades smash through the windscreen,
               barely missing the top of Plissken's head. Plissken is splattered
               with glass, a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part
               of his biceps. Blood pours. The rear compartment explodes into
               flames as the engine grinds into the gas tank. Fire billows into
               the cockpit, engulfing Plissken...
               
               Outside, Plissken pulls himself out of the door. He is on fire.
               Dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the
               flaming mid-section of the ship explodes in a roaring fireball.
               
               Plissken climbs to his feet, smoking, wounded...
               
               ... as Malloy, the President, Brazen, and a squad of police arrive
               in vehicles. They slowly get out...
               
               ... as Plissken limps toward them...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where's the anti-toxin...?
               
               PRESIDENT
               Give me the prototype.
               
               Plissken reaches into his boot, hands it to the President.
               
               MALLOY
               Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real
               one.
               
               Plissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To
               The Stars Eddie's transistor radio. The President hurls the real
               prototype away, walks to Plissken and grabs the phony. Plissken
               glances at it lying on the ground.
               
               Nobody moves. Plissken looks at their faces.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Give me the goddamn shot!
               
               Suddenly everyone begins to smirk. A couple cops laugh.
               
               MALLOY
               It was all a fake, Plissken.
               
               Plissken stares at him. More laughter.
               
               BRAZEN
               You were injected with glucose. There is
               no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going
               to die - at least not from anything we
               gave you.
               
               MALLOY
               C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's
               phony, you know that.
               
               Plissken moves toward the President, stops inches away.
               
               MALLOY
               Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride,
               and you came through. Not bad for a
               dirtbag like you.
               
               PRESIDENT
               You're free, Plissken. But if you even so
               much as break wind on a country road I'll
               crush you like a bug.
               
               The President glares at Plissken, turns, walks away.
               
               COP (O.S.)
               Commander...
               (Malloy looks at him)
               Look what we found.
               
               Across the clearing come two policemen dragging Utopia along with
               them. They bring her up in front of Malloy. Utopia glances at
               Plissken.
               
               MALLOY
               You didn't finish the mission, Plissken.
               We'll have to do that for you.
               
               Plissken, Malloy and Brazen watch as Utopia is taken away. Finally
               Plissken turns to Malloy.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Got a smoke?
               
               MALLOY
               You're gonna have to learn to respect the
               law, Snake. The United States is a no-
               smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking,
               do drugs, no women unless you're married,
               no guns, no foul language. It's a brand
               new day for you, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The name's Plissken.
               
               Plissken walks away. Follow his feet as they stop next to the
               prototype lying in the grass...
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Utopia is being strapped into an electric chair by her police
               guards. The guards step back from Utopia. One of them walks over
               to a huge switch on the wall.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               TRACKING SHOT WITH PLISSKEN
               
               He holds the real prototype, calmly pushes the button.
               

               EXT. SPACE - DAWN
               
               The ring of space satellites hover silently above the Earth. See
               the United States, North America below, as a beautiful sunrise is
               beginning.
               
               Suddenly the satellites explode into white...
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               As the sky is lit white. Malloy, Brazen, and the cops look up. All
               vehicles stop. Lights out. Sounds of motors running down.
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - DAWN
               
               Darkness. No power. Everyone looks around. Utopia smiles.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               The daylight is coming as police helicopters fall from the sky,
               crashing. Panic. Policemen run everywhere. A duty sergeant races
               up to Malloy...
               
               DUTY SERGEANT
               We're being attacked, Commander. The north
               wall.
               

               EXT. WALL - DAWN
               
               All of L.A. has arrive at the wall in boats. Gangs lean ladders,
               use ropes and hooks - they scale the wall. Pendejo Bob leads the
               charge. Pipeline is right behind him.
               

               EXT. TOP OF THE WALL - DAWN
               
               Gunfire. A pitched battle as cops try to repel the horde of L.A.
               invaders as they pour over the wall.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               The Firebase is overrun by invaders. Hand-to-hand combat. World
               War III has begun. Panicked cops race for the trees, abandoning
               their positions.
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER
               
               The Third World warriors free Utopia from the electric chair. She
               joins them as they swarm through the halls...
               

               EXT. HILLSIDE - FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               Plissken is at the edge of the Firebase, moving out into the
               hillside. Camera tracks with him towards the rising sun.
               
               A smile crosses Plissken's face. He tosses the prototype down a
               ravine, and walks away into the sunrise.
               
               FADE OUT
               
               THE END

	glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
	bare feet. They look through magazines.

	Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
	GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
	beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
	seventeen.

	MCGRAW enters the store.

				MCGRAW
		Hot goddamn day!

				PETE
		Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
		the air conditioner blastin' all day
		long.

				MCGRAW
		Not even for lunch?

				PETE
		I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
		outta the microwave.

	McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
	every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
	joins Pete by the front counter.

				MCGRAW
		Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
		will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
		Those burritos are only fit for a
		hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
		bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
		tanked tonight.

				PETE
		Whatsamatter?

				MCGRAW
			(sighs)
		Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
		Every inch of it hot and miserable.
		First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
		got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
		boy of hers was workin' the grill.
		That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
		from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
		at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
		blanket like a sick dog by ten
		thirty.

				PETE
		Isn't there a law or something
		against retards serving food to the
		public?

				MCGRAW
		Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
		be. Who knows what goes on inside 
		Mongoloid's mind?

				PETE
		You could sue the shit out of her, ya
		know. That kid belongs under a circus
		tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
		own that fuckin' place.

				MCGRAW
		What the hell would I do with that
		grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
		enough of a cross to bear just taking
		care of that potato head. Then all
		this Abilene shit happened. You
		heard about that bank robbery in
		Abilene, didn't ya?

				PETE
		That's all that's been on the box
		all day. They killed some people
		didn't they?

				MCGRAW
		Four Rangers, three cops, and two
		civilians. And they took a lady bank
		teller as a hostage.

	Pete doesn't say anything.

				MCGRAW
		They'll probably make a run for the
		border, which would bring 'em this
		way. And if we get our hands on
		those shit asses, we're talking
		payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
		I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
		commode.

				PETE
		Knock yourself out.

	McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
	exits in the bathroom.

	The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
	with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
	We see that the girl is crying.

				BLACK SUITED MAN #1
			(to Pete)
		Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
		you, asshole?
			(points to the tearful prep
			 school girl)
		Do you want this little girl to die?
			(pointing to the blonde with
			 the other guy)
		Or that little girl? Or your
		bosombuddy with the badge? Or
		yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
		I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
		Wild Bunch if I even think you're
		fuckin' with me.

	The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
	bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
	And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
	is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
	the blonde.

	Everybody speaks low and fast.

				PETE
		What do you want from me? I did what
		you said.

				SETH
		Letting him use your toilet? No store
		does that.

				PETE
		He comes in here every day and we
		bullshit. He's used my toilet a
		thousand times. If I told him no,
		he'd know something was up.

				SETH
		I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
		here, in his car, and down the road or
		you can change the name of this
		place to "Benny's World of Blood."

	Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
	leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
	at Pete.

				SETH
		Were you giving that pig signals?

				PETE
		What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
		anything!

	Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

				SETH
		He says you were scratching.

				PETE
		I wasn't scratching!

				SETH
		You callin' him a liar?

	Pete controls himself.

				PETE
		I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
		simply saying that if I was
		scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
		not because I was signaling the cop,
		it's because I'm fuckin' scared
		shitless.

	Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
	Seth.

				RICHARD
		The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
		I just go in there, blow his head off
		and get outta here.

				PETE
		Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
		act natural, and I'm acting as natural
		-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
		think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
		Award for how natural I'm acting. You
		asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
		my best.

				SETH
		Yeah, well, your best better get a
		helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
		gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
		worse.

	The toilet FLUSHES.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool.

	Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

	McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
	of the situation.

				MCGRAW
		Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
		it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
		in front of the box and just drink
		booze. How much is the bottle?

				PETE
		Six-fifty.

	Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
	and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

	McGraw goes down screaming.

	Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

	Seth charges forward.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		What the fuck was that about?

				RICHARD
			(in a low monotone)
		He signaled the Ranger.

				PETE
			(hysterical)
		I didn't.
			(to Seth)
		You gotta believe me, I didn't.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		When they were talkin', he mouthed
		the words "Help Us."

				PETE
		You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

	Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

	Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

				SETH
		What the fuck is wrong with you --

				RICHARD
		Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
		cooler with your back turned. I was by
		the magazines, I could see his face.
		And I saw him mouth:

	Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

	While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
	from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
	out a gun from it.

	Seth releases his brother.

				SETH
		Start the car.

				RICHARD
		You believe me don't cha?

				SETH
		Shut up and start the car.

	Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

	...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
	the hand.

	Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

	Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

	Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

	Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

	Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

	The two girls have run out screaming.


				SETH
			(yelling)
		Richie? You okay?

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
		I told you that bastard said, "Help
		us!"

				PETE
			(yelling)
		I never said help us!

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Well that don't matter now, 'cause
		you got about two fuckin' seconds
		to live! Richie!

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		Yeah?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		When I count three, shoot out the
		bottles behind him!

				RICHARD
		Gotcha!

				SETH
		One... Two... Three.


	The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

	They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

	Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
	RAIN down on him.

	Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

	Richard keeps FIRING.

	Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
	fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

	The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

	The fireball lands behind the counter.

	The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
	screams from behind the counter.

	Seth smiles to himself and stands.

	Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

	Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
	still holding his weapon and FIRING.

	Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

	Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
	Pastry display.

	Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.



	EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
	flames.

				SETH
		What did I tell you? What did I tell
		you? Buy the road map and leave.

				RICHARD
		What am I supposed to do, Seth?
		He recognized us.

				SETH
		He didn't recognize shit.

	Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

				RICHARD
		Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
		looked at us -- you especially --
		I knew he knew.


	They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
	starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
	hear Seth mumbling under the motor.

				SETH
		Low profile. Do you know what the
		words "low profile" mean?

	CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.

	The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
	the street, and speeds off down the road.

	We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
	behind it, as the store burns out of control.

	OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.

	Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY

	The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
	OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
	trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
	prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
	his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
	slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

	Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
	boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

	The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
	and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
	on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:

	AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.

	The rest of the titles play over black as the song
	continues.

	EXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's Gravy Train is a truck stop off of Highway
	290.

	SUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN':

		   FORT STOCKTON
		238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER


	INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
	cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
	the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

	It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
	FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
	category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
	JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
	and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
	possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
	sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
	complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
	Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
	who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
	garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
	of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

				JACOB
		We got about two more hours of day
		light left. That'll get us into
		El Paso, which is right next to the
		border. We'll stop at a motel --

				SCOTT
		Stop? We're not going to actually
		stop at a motel, are we?

	Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
	that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

				SCOTT AND KATE
		We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
		those over priced roach havens. We're
		self contained.

				JACOB
		Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
		overzealous, but give me a break, I
		just bought it.

	Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

				SCOTT
		Why, just look at all this. You got
		your kitchen --

				KATE
		-- you got your microwave --

				SCOTT
		-- you got your sink --

				KATE
		-- you got your shower --

				SCOTT
		-- see this, television!

				KATE
		Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
		real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

				JACOB
		Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
		introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
		what say we drop this?

				SCOTT
			(to Kate)
		The truth hurts.

				KATE
			(to Scott)
		It's the bitterest of pills.

				JACOB
		You two ought to start a stand-up
		act, because you're just wasting your
		humor on me.

				KATE
		Ain't it the truth.

				SCOTT
		Why do you want to stop?

				JACOB
		I'm exhausted.

				SCOTT
		Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
		into Mexico.

	Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
	new motor home."

				JACOB
		I just bet you would. Don't even thin
		about it. Besides, I want to have one
		night's sleep in an
		honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
		the home are okay, but they're not
		like a real bed.

				KATE
		Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
		swim.

				SCOTT
		I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
		the bathroom.

	Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
	restroom.

	Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
	silence before...

				KATE
		Dad, when I called the machine to
		check our messages there was one from
		Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
		wouldn't permanently replace you until
		we came back. He said when we come
		home, if you still feel the same
		way --

				JACOB
		That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
		call him tomorrow and tell him not
		to bother waiting.

				KATE
		I didn't want to talk about this in
		front of Scott because he gets upset.
		But you don't believe in God
		anymore?

				JACOB
		Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
		know this is hard on you kids. After
		Jenny's death, this is probably the
		last thing you need. But I can't do
		it any longer. My congregation needs
		spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
		get that from me anymore. My faith is
		gone. To answer your question, yes,
		I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
		them? No. After Jenny died, I just
		thought, what's the point?

				KATE
			(pushing him)
		It's just, all our lives you've been
		a pastor. For twenty years you've
		preached trust in the lord. And then
		one day you wake up and say fuck him?

				JACOB
		I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
		connected anymore.

				KATE
		That happens, you'll get it back.

				JACOB
		Kate, give your old man a little
		credit. Every person who chooses the
		service of God as their life's work
		has something in common. I don't care
		if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
		a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
		many times during your life you'll
		look at your reflection in the mirror
		and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
		all done it. I'm not going through a
		lapse. What I've experienced is closer
		to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
		your faith. I've just decided not to
		devote my life to God anymore.

				KATE
		What do you think Mom would say?

				JACOB
		Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

	INT. LOBBY - DEW DROP INN - DAY

	Seth stands at the front desk of the Dew Drop Inn. A

	Nobody responds to the bell. Seth BANGS it impatiently five

	EXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY

	Richard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the
	radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the
	walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up,
	and drives them to their room.

				RICHARD
		Do they have cable?

				SETH
		No.

				RICHARD
		Do they have an X-rated channel?

				SETH
		No.

				RICHARD
		Do they have a waterbed?

				SETH
		They don't have anything except four
		walls and a roof, and that's all we
		need.

	Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
	trunk close to the door.

	The two brothers get out of the car.

				SETH
			(tossing Richie the motel keys)
		Open the door. We gotta do this fast.

	Richie opens the door.

	Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
	empty.

	CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.

	TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.

	SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
		up in the trunk.

	She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
	scared and looks an absolute mess.

				SETH
		Don't say a word.

	The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
	the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
	trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
	see any, slams the door.


	INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY

	Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.

				SETH
		You. Plant yourself in that chair.

	She sits down in the chair.

				HOSTAGE
		What are you planning on doing with --

				SETH
		-- I said plant yourself. Plants don't
		talk. You wanna get on my good side?
		Just sit still and don't make a peep.

	She shuts up.

	Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
	wound.

				SETH
		Let me help you.

	He helps him get his jacket off.

				SETH
		How's it feel?

				RICHARD
		How ya think, it hurts like a
		son-of-a-bitch.

	Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
	the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
	against.

				SETH
		I got both rooms on either side of us,
		so we don't gotta worry about
		eavesdropping assholes. How's that
		feel? You okay?

				RICHARD
		Feels good.

				SETH
		I'm gonna go get the money.

	He heads for the door.


	EXT. COURTYARD - MOTEL - DAY

	Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans

	INT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY

	Seth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has
	the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping
	stations. Seth looks at his watch.

				SETH
		It's about five o'clock.
			(to hostage)
		What time does it get dark around
		here?

				HOSTAGE
		About seven.

				SETH
		Good. I'm going towards the border to
		check things out while it's still
		daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the
		rendezvous.

				RICHARD
		Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
		can arrange a better deal than thirty
		percent.

				SETH
		That's their standard deal, brother.
		They ain't about to change it for us.

				RICHARD
		Did you even to try to negotiate?

				SETH
		These guys ain't spic fire cracker
		salesman from Tijuana. They don't even
		know the meaning of the word "barter".
		You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
		them thirty percent of your loot. It's
		scripture. So it is written, so shall
		it be done. You want sanctuary, you
		pay the price, and the price is thirty
		percent.

				RICHARD
		All I'm saying --

				SETH
		-- This conversation is over.

	Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
	hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

				SETH
		Now, we need to have a talk. What's
		your name?

				HOSTAGE
		Gloria.

	He shakes her hand.

				SETH
		Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
		brother Richie. Let's cut to the
		chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
		and all I want is a yes or no answer.
		Do you want to live through this?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good. Then let me explain the house
		rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
		along like a house on fire. Rule number
		one: No noise, no question. You make a
		noise...
			(he holds up his .45)
		...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
		question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
		you absolutely, positively clear about
		rule number one?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Rule number two: You do what we say,
		when we say it. If you don't, see rule
		number one.

	Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
	cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
	hammer.

				SETH
		Rule number three: Don't you ever try
		and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
		five little friends, and they all run
		faster 'n you can. Got it?

	She nods her head yes.

	He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

				SETH
		Open your eyes.

	She does.

				SETH
		Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
		rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
		get out of this alive. I give you my
		word. Okay?

	She nods her head yes.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I'll be back in a bit.

	He exits.

	Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
	across the room in the chair.


				RICHARD
		Wanna come up here on the bed and
		watch TV with me?


	You can tell she doesn't want to.

	He pats the empty space next to him.

				RICHARD
		Come on.

	She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
	next to him.


	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the

		Things are real hot here. Crossing's
		gonna be a bitch.
			(pause)
		Don't worry, we'll get across. But
		when we do, where do we go?
			(pause)
		Can we make it as close to the border
		as possible? Texas wants our balls.
		The quicker we're in your protection,
		the better I'll feel.
			(pause)
		Okay, where?
			(pause)
		The Titty Twister?
			(he laughs)
		I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll
		see you and your men at the "Titty
		Twister" tomorrow morning.
			(pause)
		Bye, my friend.

	Richard lies on the bed by himself, propped up by pillows,

	A local newscaster named KELLY HOUGE is reporting a story

								  CUT TO:

	VIDEO INTERVIEW

	Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.

				STANLEY CHASE
		For the time being we are very
		confident we will apprehend the
		fugitives in the next forty-eight
		hours. The Bureau, local law
		enforcement and the Texas Rangers
		have all joined forces in forming a
		dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
		Gecko.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Agent Chase, does it appear that they
		are heading for Mexico.

				STANLEY CHASE
		Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
		alerted the Mexican authorities. They
		intend to cooperate every way possible
		in bringing these fugitives to
		justice.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Are you optimistic about the safety of
		the hostage they took in Abilene,
		Gloria Hill?

				STANLEY CHASE
		We've received no news one way or the
		other. We can only hope for the best.

				KELLY HOUGE
		What about the report from an
		eyewitness at the liquor store who
		said one of the brothers was shot?

				STANLEY CHASE
		This can't be confirmed at this time,
		but we do believe it to be true. We
		have reason to believe it was the
		youngest brother Richard, and he was
		shot in the vicinity of his neck and
		shoulders by the store's clerk.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Is it safe to assume that because the
		death count involved and the loss of
		life of law enforcement officers, that
		the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
		force are taking this manhunt
		personally?

				STANLEY CHASE
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

								  CUT TO:

	RICHARD SMILES.

				RICHARD
			(Newscaster's voice)
		Is it safe to assume since the law
		enforcement authorities in the great
		state of Texas are homosexuals of a
		sick and deviate nature, that they
		will be too busy fucking each other
		up the ass to actually catch The
		Gecko Brothers?
			(in an FBI voice)
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

	He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the
	Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.

				CASPER
		Would you play with me?

	A big burly COP turns around.

				COP
		Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!

	The cop heads for the hills. Casper cries.

	Seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two
	take-out bags of Big Kahuna burgers.

				RICHARD
		Shit, I started to get worried. Where
		the fuck ya been?

				SETH
		Sight seein'.

				RICHARD
		What'd ya see?

				SETH
		Cops.

				RICHARD
		Didya look at the border?

	Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
	and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off
	the TV

				SETH
		Yeah, I saw the border. Through
		binoculars from on top of a high
		building. That's about as close as I
		risked getting. What's the TV say?

				RICHARD
		They're going to apprehend us in
		forty-eight hours.

	Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		I gotta figure a way to get across
		that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
		around El Paso our lives ain't worth
		a shit.

				RICHARD
		Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
		in and wait for things to cool down.

				SETH
		Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
		worse before it gets any fuckin'
		better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
		killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
		ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
		find us, and when they find us,
		they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
		very personal when ya kill their law
		enforcement officers. The El Paso
		police have already started a motel
		and hotel search for us.

				RICHARD
		How do you know?

				SETH
		I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
		our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
		is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
		rendezvous on the other side, then
		Carlos and his boys will escort us to
		El Ray and --

	Seth stops talking and looks around.

				SETH
		Where's the woman?

				RICHARD
		What?

	Seth's out of his chair.

				SETH
		What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
		woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
		is she, Richard!?

				RICHARD
		She's in the other room.

				SETH
		What the fuck is she doin' there?!

	He goes to the door of the adjoining room.

				RICHARD
		Seth, before you open the door, let
		me explain what happened.

	Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
	He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
	Then he BURSTS open the door.

	The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
	obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

	Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
	room with the dead body.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

	Richard rises from the bed.

				RICHARD
		Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
		just explain what happened.

	Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

	Richard backs up.

				SETH
		Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
		explanation. What's the matter with
		you?

				RICHARD
			(low and calm)
		There's nothing wrong with me,
		brother. That woman tried to escape
		and I did what I had to do.

				SETH
		No.
			(pause)
		That woman wouldn't of said shit if
		she had a mouthful.

				RICHARD
		Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
		wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
		became a whole different person.

				SETH
			(slowly approaching)
		Is it me? Is it my fault?

				RICHARD
		It's not your fault, it's her fault!

	Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
	holding tightly to his wrist.

				SETH
		Is this my fault? Do you think this
		is what I am?

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		This is not me! I am a professional
		fucking thief. I steal money. You try
		to stop me, god help you. But I don't
		kill people I don't have to, and I
		don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
		how it's done. Do you understand?

				RICHARD
		Seth, if you were me --

				SETH
		Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
		yes.

				RICHARD
		Yes.

				SETH
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

				RICHARD
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

	Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

				SETH
			(whispers in Richie's ear)
		We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
		sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
		and rice and beans. None of this
		shit's gonna matter.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
	home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
	Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
	the Old-Timer.

				KATE
		I can't believe he's stopping here.
		This place looks totally cruddy.

	Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
	home.

				KATE
		Dad, why are we stopping here?

	He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

				JACOB
		There's nothing wrong with this
		place.

				KATE
		It's a flop house.

				JACOB
		It's not a flop house. It's basic
		and simple. That doesn't make it a
		flop house.

				KATE
		If it doesn't have a pool, we're
		looking for a new place.

	Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
	courtyard.

				JACOB
		It has a bed. That's all I care about.

				KATE
		Other places have beds, they also have
		cable TV, a gym, room service...


	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

	Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
	thinking about how he's going to get over the border
	tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
	Fuller's motor home.

	Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
	Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
	THUD... THUD...

				KATE
		Owww, my head.

	Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
	window.

				JACOB
		Watch where you're going!

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
	up at the giant motor home.

	JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

	Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

				SCOTT
		What's this guy's problem?

				JACOB
		I have no idea.

	Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
	move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

	HONK!

				JACOB
		Anytime, man.

	The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
	on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
	side to let them pass.

	Pass they do!

				KATE
		Creepy guy.

	SETH

	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
	just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
	unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
	border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
	room #9.


	INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

	The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
	the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
	beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
	on the bed.

	Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
	electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

	KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
	shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
	POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
	He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
	oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		What?

	From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
		disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

	Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
	the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

				JACOB
		I hope none of this is disturbing you.

	Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
	he smiles.

	Jacob opens the door and sees...

	... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
	nicest guy in the entire world.

				RICHARD
		Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
		Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
		Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
		lady friend need some ice and we don't
		seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
		possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
		right back.

				JACOB
			(still partially asleep)
		Sure.

	We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
	ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
	couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

	He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
	closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

				JACOB
		What is this?

	Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

				SETH
		It's called a punch.

	Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
	and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
	mouth.

				RICHARD
		Sit down.

	Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

				RICHARD
		Good boy.

	Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
	his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		What's your name?

				JACOB
		Jacob.

				SETH
		Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
		down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
		I'll shoot you in the face.

	Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		Okay, move the Jap over there.

	Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

				RICHARD
		Upsy daisy.

	...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

	Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
	to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

				SETH
			(to his hostages)
		What's the story with you two? You a
		couple of fags?

				JACOB
		He's my son.

				SETH
		How does that happen? You don't look
		Japanese.

				JACOB
		Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

				SETH
		Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

				JACOB
		What's this about, money?

				SETH
		It's about money, all right, but not
		yours. You see, me and my brother here
		are in a little hot water and we need
		your assistance.

	The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
	Kate walks in.

	The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

	Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
	and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
	ready to spit.

				SETH
			(to Scott and Jacob)
		Stop!

	Jacob and Scott freeze.

	Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
	positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

				KATE
		What's going on?

				RICHARD
		We're having a wet bikini contest,
		and you just won.

				JACOB
			(to Kate)
		It's okay, honey. Everything's going
		to be all right.

				SETH
		Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
		do nothin' stupid.
			(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
			 who are still standing)
		You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

	They slowly sit.

	Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

	Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
	for their own reasons.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		Where are the keys to the motor home?

				JACOB
		On the dresser.

				SETH
		Richie, take the keys. Start that big
		bastard up, and drive it up front.

	Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
	feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

	He looks in her face.

	CLOSE-UP KATE
		
	She smiles at him.

				KATE
		Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
		my pussy?

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD
		
				RICHARD
		Sure.


				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

	Richard's eyes go to Seth.

	Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

				SETH
		Not when you get around to it, now.

	Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
	room.

				SETH
			(pointing at Kate)
		You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
		put on some clothes.

	She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
	bathroom.

	Seth GRABS her wrist.

				SETH
		You got three minutes. One second
		longer, I shoot your father in the
		face. Do you understand what I just
		said?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		Do you believe me?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		You damn well better. Go.

	She goes into the bathroom.

				JACOB
		Look, if you want the motor home, just
		take it and get out.

	Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
	hostages.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
		easy.

	We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

				SETH
		Get ready to move out, we're all going
		on a little ride.

	Jacob shakes his head "no."

				JACOB
		Not a chance.

				SETH
		Come again?

				JACOB
		If you're taking people, take me. But
		my kids aren't going anywhere with
		you.

				SETH
		Sorry, I need everybody.

				JACOB
		My children are not going with you,
		and that's that.

				SETH
			(angry)
		That's not fuckin' that...
			(holds up his gun)
		this is fuckin' this.
			(he calms down and looks
			 at Scott)
		Go sit over there.

	Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
	leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
	conversational tone.

				SETH
		I ain't got time to fuck around with
		you, so I'll make this simple. Take
		your kids and get in the car, or I'll
		execute all three of you right now.
			(he cocks the gun and puts
			 it right in Jacob's face)
		What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

	Jacob looks at him.

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good.
			(to Scott)
		Your old man's all right, he just
		saved your life.

	Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

				SETH
		Times up, Princess.

	The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
	T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

				SETH
		Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
	the Lone Star night.


	INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT

	Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
	and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

				KATE
		Excuse me.

	Richard zeros in on her.

				RICHARD
		What?

				KATE
		Where are you taking us?

				RICHARD
		Mexico.

				KATE
		What's in Mexico?

				RICHARD
		Mexicans.

	He doesn't smile.

	In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
	wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
	seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
	calmly.

				SETH
			(reading his driver's license)
		Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
		ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
		course it is.
			(motioning behind him)
		What are their names?

				JACOB
		Scott and Kate.

	Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

				SETH
		Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
		Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

	Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

				SETH
		Who's this?

				JACOB
		My wife.

				SETH
		Where is the little lady?

				JACOB
		In heaven.

				SETH
		She's dead?

				JACOB
		Yes, she is.

				SETH
		How'd she die?

				JACOB
		Auto wreck.

				SETH
		Come on, gimme some more details.
		How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
		kill her?

				JACOB
		No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
		on the car weren't great. She had to
		stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
		she crashed, she died.

				SETH
		Died instantly?

				JACOB
		Not quite. She was trapped in the
		wreck for about six hours before she
		passed on.

				SETH
		Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
		it in and break it off, don't they?

				JACOB
		Yes, they do.

	Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
	license.

				SETH
		Is this real?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I've seen one of these before. A
		friend of mine had himself declared
		a minister of his own religion. Away
		to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
		doing, or are you the real McCoy?

				JACOB
		Real McCoy.

				SETH
		You're a preacher?

				JACOB
		I was a minister.

				SETH
		Was? As in not anymore?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Why'd ya quit?

				JACOB
		I think I've gotten about as up close
		and personal with you as I'm gonna
		get. Now if you need me like I think
		you need me, you're not gonna kill me
		'cause I won't answer your stupid,
		prying questions. So, with all due
		respect, mind your own business.

				SETH
		I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
		be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
		friendly. But you're right, enough
		with the getting to know you shit.
		Now, there's two ways we can play this
		hand. One way is me and you go round
		an' round all fuckin' night. The other
		way, is we reach some sort of an
		understanding. Now, if we go down that
		first path at the end of the day, I'll
		win. But we go down the second, we'll
		both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
		ass about you or your fuckin' family.
		Y'all can live forever or die this
		second and I don't care which. The
		only things I do care about are me
		that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
		our money. And right now I need to get
		those three things into Mexico. Now,
		stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
		you don't give a shit about seeing me
		and my brother receiving justice, or
		the bank getting its money back. Right
		now all you care about is the safety
		of your daughter, your son and
		possibly yourself. Am I correct?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I thought so. You help us get across
		the border without incident, stay with
		us the rest of the night without
		trying anything funny, and in the
		morning we'll let you and your family
		go. That way everybody gets what they
		want. You and your kids get out of
		this alive and we get into Mexico.
		Everybody's happy.

				JACOB
		How do I know you'll keep your word?

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
		this shit.

				JACOB
		You want me to sit here and be
		passive. The only way being passive in
		this situation makes sense is if I
		believe you'll let us go. I'm not
		there yet. You have to convince me
		you're telling the truth.

				SETH
		Look, dickhead, the only thing you
		need to be convinced about is that
		you're stuck in a situation with a
		coupla real mean motor scooters. I
		don't wanna hafta worry about you all
		fuckin' night. And I don't think you
		wanna be worrying about my brother's
		intentions toward your daughter all
		night. You notice the way he looked
		at her, didn't ya?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Didn't like it, did ya?

				JACOB
		No, I didn't.

				SETH
		Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
		I'm willing to make a deal. You
		behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
		try to escape. I'll keep my brother
		off your daughter and let you all
		loose in the morning.

				JACOB
		You won't let him touch her?

				SETH
		I can handle Richie, don't worry.

	The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
	Seth sticks out his hand.

				SETH
		I give you my word.

	Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
	word.

				SETH
			(hand sticks out)
		My words, my law. Better you not take
		it, and that's just where we are,
		then take it and not mean it.

	Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

				JACOB
		If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
		don't give a fuck how many guns you
		have, nothing will stop me from
		killing him.

				SETH
		Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
		kill all of you.
			(calling to the back)
		Kate, honey!

				KATE
		Yeah.

				SETH
		You must have a bible in here, don't
		cha?

				KATE
		Yeah, we got a bible.

				SETH
		Get it and bring it up here, will
		ya, please?

	Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
	front.

				SETH
		Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
			(to Jacob)
		Put your hand on it.

	Jacob does.

				SETH
		Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
		try to escape and you'll get us across
		the border.

				JACOB
		I swear to God I won't try to escape
		and I'll do my best to get you into
		Mexico.

				SETH
		You best better get it done, Pops.

	Seth places his hand on the Bible.

				SETH
		I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
		morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
		also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
		I'll slit all your throats.

	Richard's in the back with Kate and Scott. Richard,

	Back to Richard.

				RICHARD
		Did ya mean what you said back there?

	Kate turns to him.

				KATE
		What?

				RICHARD
		In the room. Were you serious, or were
		you just foolin' around? I'm just
		bringing it up, 'cause if you really
		want me to do that for you, I will.

				KATE
		Do what?

				RICHARD
			(in a whisper)
		What you said to me in the room.

				KATE
			(whispers back)
		What did I say?

				RICHARD
			(whisper)
		You asked me if I would --

				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		What?

	Seth and Jacob.

				SETH
		I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say
		talk to 'em. You guys ain't got nothin' to say
		to one another. So cut the chatter.

	Richard turns to Kate.

				RICHARD
			(quiet)
		We'll talk later.

	Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

	Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
	Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
	are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
	stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
	Fuller's mobile home.


	INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
	up and goes into action.

				SETH
		Okay everybody, it's show time.
		Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

	Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

				SETH
		Scott, you come up front with your
		daddy.

	Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

				JACOB
		I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

				SETH
		As long as you're cool, she'll be
		cool. What're ya gonna say?

				JACOB
		I don't have the slightest idea.

				SETH
		Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
		gun next to Kate's temple.

	Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
	closing the door behind him.

	Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
	thing began.

				SCOTT
		What are you gonna do?

				JACOB
		I'm gonna try and get us across the
		border.

				SCOTT
		No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
		they're back there.

	Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.


	INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
	small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

	Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
	Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
	mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

	Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

	Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
	should open the door.

	Everybody talks low and quiet.

				RICHARD
		This isn't gonna work.

				SETH
		Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

				RICHARD
		I just want to go on record as saying
		this is a bad idea.

				SETH
		Duly noted. Now, shut up.

	Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

				RICHARD
			(to himself)
		They're gonna search the van.

				SETH
			(offhand)
		As long as you don't act like a
		fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

				RICHARD
		What does that mean?

				SETH
			(distracted)
		What?

	Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

				RICHARD
		You just called me a fuckin' nut.

				SETH
		No, I didn't.

				RICHARD
		Yes, you did. You said as long as I
		don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
		that I've been acting like a fuckin'
		nut.

				SETH
		Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
		cool.

				RICHARD
		You meant that, but you meant the
		other, too.

	Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

				SETH
			(serious as a heart attack)
		This ain't the time, Richard.

				RICHARD
			(his voice rising)
		Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
		fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
		that stops the train on its tracks.

				SETH
			(real quiet and violent)
		Keep your voice down.

				RICHARD
			(quiet back)
		Or what?

	BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT		

				JACOB
		Have you forgotten about your sister?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill us. They get us
		across the border, they're gonna take
		us out in the desert and shoot us.

				JACOB
		If they get over the border, they're
		gonna let us go.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I watch those reality shows.
		They never let anybody go. Any cop
		will tell you, in a situation like
		this, you get a chance, you go for it.
		This is our chance.

				JACOB
		What about Kate?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill her anyway. At
		least now with all these cops we've
		got a fighting chance.

				JACOB
		Son, I have this situation under
		control. I know exactly what I'm
		doing. You're going to have to trust
		me on this.

				SCOTT
		If trusting you means trusting those
		fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
		you don't tell the cops, I will.


	Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
	to him.

				JACOB
		Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
		do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
		me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
		running this show, I make the
		decisions.

				SCOTT
		He's running the show.

				JACOB
		I'm running the show. I make the
		plays, and you back the plays I
		make. Stop thinking with your fucking
		balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
		desperate men with nothing to fucking
		lose ain't the time to "go for it."
		I need your cover. Cover my ass.

	There's a HONK behind them.

	They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
	BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

	A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

				BORDER GUARD
		How many with you?

				JACOB
		Just my son and I.

				BORDER GUARD
		What is your purpose in Mexico?

				JACOB
		Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
		first bullfight.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

				RICHARD
		I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
		thing I did?

				SETH
		This ain't the time.

				RICHARD
		Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
		ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
		out? Yeah, you're right, that was
		pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
		stupid. But you know what? I can fix
		that right now.

	SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
	Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
	Richard fall in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		What was that?

				JACOB
		Oh, that's just my daughter in the
		bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		You said it was just you and your son.

				JACOB
		I meant me, my son and my daughter.

	CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

				BORDER GUARD
		Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

	CLOSE-UP KATE

	We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
	around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

	Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
	we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

				KATE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
		It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

				KATE
		It's open.

	We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
	face. She's looking up.

	BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

	HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
	on the toilet.

				KATE
		Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

				BORDER GUARD
		Excuse me.

	He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
	Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
	the floor of the shower knocked out.

	Seth and Kate meet eyes.

	He gives her the O.K. signal.

								  CUT TO:

	BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

	We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
	getting smaller as we drive away from it.

	Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

				SCOTT
		It's clear.

	Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

				SETH
		Goddamn, that was. intense!

	Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
	farther and farther away. No cars following.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		We did it.
			(pause)
		We're in Mexico.

	Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

	Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
	along with Scott.

	Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
	the van.

	Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
	all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
	turns to Kate.

				SETH
			(loud and happy)
		Come here, Kate!

	Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

	He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
	and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
	dizzily onto the bed.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		You were magnificent! You told him to
		shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
		the shower, and I'm thinking to
		myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
		I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
		do -- he shuts the fucking door!

	Kate kind of half smiles.

				SETH
		If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
		fuckin' marry you!

	Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

				SETH
		I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
		raised a fuckin' woman.

	Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

				JACOB
		We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
		Now it's time for your part, letting
		us go.

				SETH
		Pops, when you're right, you're right,
		and you are right.

				KATE
			(suddenly brightens)
		You're gonna let us go?

				SETH
		In the morning, darlin', in the
		morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
		F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
		through hell, and I know I've been one
		rough pecker, but from here on end you
		guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
		me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
		Jacob, keep going on this road till
		you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
		When you get to Digayo, turn this big
		bastard left, go on down for a few
		miles, then you see a bar called "The
		Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
		can't miss it.

				JACOB
		Then?

				SETH
		Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
		going.

	He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
	to Richard.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
	his face.

				SETH (O.S.)
		 C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
		 career out of it.

	Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
	foot of the bed.

				SETH
		You okay?

				RICHARD
			(disoriented)
		Yeah, I think so. What happened?

				SETH
		I don't know, you just passed out.

				RICHARD
		I did?

				SETH
		Yeah, we were just standing there. You
		said something about your shoulder
		hurting, then you just hit the ground
		like a sack of potatoes.

				RICHARD
		Really?

				SETH
		Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
		the toilet hard. It scared the shit
		outta me. Sure you're okay?

				RICHARD
		Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
		fucked up.

				SETH
		Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
		clear your head right up. We are
		officially Mexicans.

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		We are...
			(singing)
		"South of the border down Mexico way."

				RICHARD
		We are?

				SETH
		Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
		right now. We get there, we pound
		booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
		us to El Ray. And then me and you,
		brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
		like them apples?

	Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

				RICHARD
		Far out.
			(pause)
		Where are my glasses?

				SETH
		They broke when you fell.

				RICHARD
		Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

				SETH
		Don't worry about it, we'll get you
		some glasses.

				RICHARD
		What dya mean, don't worry about it.
		Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
		I can't fuckin' see.

				SETH
		When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
		of it.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, like a Mexican
		hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
		fuckin' prescription.

				SETH
		It's not a big deal, unless you make
		it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
		Richie, stop bringing me down with
		bullshit.

	Jacob calls to the back.

				JACOB
		Guys! We're here.

								  CUT TO:

	A neon sign that flashes:

		THE TITTY TWISTER
		 Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

	Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
	on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
	well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
	by a neon hand.


	EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
	The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
	crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
	Mexico.

	The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
	nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
	miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
	parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
	RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
	outside reading things like: 

	"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
	"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
	"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
	"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
	THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
	"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
	TWISTER DANCERS."

	In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
	out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
	A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
	A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
	lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

				CHET
		Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
		go. At the Titty Twister we're
		slashing pussy in half! This is a
		pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
		vast selection of pussy! We got white
		pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
		yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
		wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
		bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
		smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
		pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
		pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
		pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
		it, you don't want it!

	The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
	lot and stops.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
	out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

				SETH
			(to the group)
		Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
		Here's the deal; this place closes at
		dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
		sometime before dawn. Which by my
		guesstimate is somewhere between three
		or four hours from now. So we're gonna
		go in there, take a seat, have a drink
		-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
		for Carlos. That could be an hour,
		that could be three hours, I don't
		know which. But when he gets here,
		me and Richie are going to leave
		with him. After we split, you guys
		are officially out of this stewpot.
		Let me just say I'm real happy about
		where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
		don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
		with me" attitude going on. Now, if
		everybody just keeps playin' it cool
		-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
		-- everybody's gonna get what they
		want. Comprende, amigos?

	Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

				SETH
		Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
		I'm buyin'.


	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
	Fuller family step out into the night.

	They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
	It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

				JACOB
		Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

				SETH
		Shit, I been to bars make this place
		look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

				RICHARD
		I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
		been to some fucked up places in my
		time, but that place is fucked up.

	Seth can't believe it.

				SETH
			(in a baby talk voice)
		Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
		baby too afraid to go into the big
		scary bar?

	The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
	but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
	personal.

				RICHARD
		That's what you think?

				SETH
		That's how you're lookin', Richie.

				RICHARD
		I'm lookin' scared?

				SETH
		That's what you look like.

				RICHARD
		You know what you look like?

				SETH
		No, Richie, what do I look like?

				RICHARD
		You're lookin' green.

	That's not what Seth expected to hear.

				SETH
		How?

				RICHARD
		Where are you right now?

				SETH
		What do you mean?

				RICHARD
		Where are you?

				SETH
		I'm here with you.

				RICHARD
		No, you're not. You're sippin'
		margaritas in El Ray. But we're
		not in El Ray. We're here --
		getting ready to go in there.
		You're so pleased with yourself
		about getting into Mexico, you
		think the job's down. It ain't.
		Get back on the clock. That's a
		fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
		there for a coupla hours, in all
		likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
		So get your shit together, brother.

				SETH
		My shit is together.

				RICHARD
		It don't look together.

				SETH
		Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
		doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
		just not used to seein' me happy,
		'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
		years since I been happy. But my shit
		is forever together.

	Richard believes Seth's response.

				RICHARD
		Okay, just checkin'.

	They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
	the microphone.

				CHET
			(yelling into the microphone)
		Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
		Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
		price, you get another piece of pussy,
		of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
		Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
		If you can find cheaper pussy
		anywhere, fuck it!

	Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

				CHET
			(in microphone, towards Kate)
		What's this? A new flavor approaching.
		Apple Pie Pussy.

				SETH
		Step aside, asshole.

	Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

				CHET
		Not so fast, Slick.

	Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
	the BONE SNAPS in two.

	Chet lets out a SCREAM.

	Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
	NOSE.

	Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

	Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
	SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

	After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
	to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

	Chet is OUT.

	The whole altercation took two seconds.

	Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
	everyone.

				SETH
		Now, is my shit together, or is my
		shit together?

	Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

				RICHARD
			(slappin' Seth five)
		Your shit is forever together!

	They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
	and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


	INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

	If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
	from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
	ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
	they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
	and the beer at closing.

	In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
	while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
	at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
	BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
	bikers and truckers.

	One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
	name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
	the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
	ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
	crowd.

	Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
	here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
	but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

	Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
	They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
	Seth is the first to say something.

				SETH
		Now this is my kinda place! I could
		become a regular.

	The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
	as they approach.

	Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
	populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
	look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
	up to the bar.

				SETH
		Whiskey!

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in English)
		You can't come in here.

				SETH
		What dya mean?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This is a private club. You're not
		welcome.

				SETH
		Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
		to drink here?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This bar is for bikers and truckers
		only.
			(points his finger to Seth)
		You, get out!

	Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
	HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to Seth in Spanish)
		Walk, Pendaho.

	Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

				SETH
			(low)
		Take your hand off me.

				BIG EMILIO
			(Spanish)
		I'm going to count to three.

				SETH
		No, I'm going to count to three.

				BIG EMILIO
		Uno...

				SETH
		Two..

	Jacob jumps in the middle.

				JACOB
		Now wait a minute, there's no reason
		to get ugly. There's just a
		misunderstanding going on here. You
		said this bar is for truckers and
		bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

	Everybody looks at Jacob.

	As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

				JACOB
		If you look outside your door, parked
		in your parking lot, you'll see a big
		ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
		In order to drive that legally, you
		need a class two driver's license.
		That is the same license that the
		DMV requires truck drivers to carry
		in order to drive a truck.
			(he takes the license out
			 of his wallet and lays it
			 on the bar)
		That is me, and this is my class two
		license. This is a truck driver's bar,
		I am a truck driver, and these are
		my friends.

	Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

	Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
	everyone in the party and smiles.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Jacob)
		Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
		can I get you?

	Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

				SETH
		Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

	Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
	smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
	But instead he just says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Coming right up.

	Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
	party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
	buddy punch on the shoulder.

				RICHARD
		Good job, Pops.

	Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

				SETH
		That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
		number one problem with Mexico, it's
		not service oriented. I was feelin'
		so good, and those fuckin' spies
		brought me down.

	Richard puts his arm around Seth.

				RICHARD
		Fuck 'em, shake it off.

	Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
	at the guy, still pissed.

				SETH
		You serve food, Jose?

	Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
	but he just smiles and says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Best in Mexico.

				SETH
		I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
		table, send over a waitress to take
		our order.

	Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

	We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
	Charlie's head.

	The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
	walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
	from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

	The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
	wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

	Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

				RICHARD
		Anytime you want a lap dance with that
		broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

	He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
	surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
	words about the party in Spanish.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in Spanish)
		They're not the normal road trash we
		normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
		No one knows they're here.

	The five of them find a table and sit down.

	Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
	bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

				SETH
		Who else?

				JACOB
		Pass.

				SETH
			(picking a fight)
		Why not, against your religion?

				JACOB
			(won't be baited)
		No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
		now.

				SETH
		Suit yourself, more for me.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty?

	Scott shakes his head no.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		How 'bout you?
			(pointing at Scott and Kate)
		are safer in here with us than
		wandering around a Mexican border town
		all night long. Just don't do nothin'
		stupid and we'll all get along fine.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty, you sure you don't want a
		drink?

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll have one.

				JACOB
		No you won't.

	Seth pours Scott a shot.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
		don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
		up, boy.

	Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
	on-drinker's tremor.

	Seth turns to Kate.

				SETH
		How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
		round two?

				KATE
		Okay.

	Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
	knocks it back.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
		just created a monster.

	Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

				JACOB
		Why are you so agitated?

				SETH
		I'm still stewing about that ape
		laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
		bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
		too.

				JACOB
		He backed down.

				SETH
		He's smilin' at us. But behind his
		smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
		I hear that loud and clear.

				JACOB
		What are you going to do?

				SETH
			(picking up the whiskey bottle)
		I'm gonna just sit here and drain
		this bottle. And when I've drunk the
		last drop, if I still feel then, the
		way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
		bottle and break it over his melon
		head.

				JACOB
		Before we stepped in here, you told
		all of us to be cool. That means you,
		too.

				SETH
			(tossing it off)
		I never said do what I do, I said do
		what I say.

				JACOB
		Are you so much a fucking loser, you
		can't tell when you've won?

	Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
	believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
	down his drinking glass.

				SETH
		What did you call me?

				JACOB
		Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
		asked a question. Would you like me to
		ask it again? Very well. Are you such
		a loser you can't tell when you've
		won?
			(pause)
		The entire state of Texas, along with
		the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
		find you? No. They couldn't. They had
		every entrance to the border covered.
		There's no way you could get across.
		Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
		Seth, enjoy it.

	Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

				SETH
		Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
		me. I insist.

	Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
	in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

				SETH
		To your family.

				JACOB
		To yours.

	They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

				JACOB
		Now, is your shit together?

				SETH
		Forever together.

	Seth turns to Scott.

				SETH
		In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
		it that's yours.

				SCOTT
		Yeah, it's mine.

				SETH
		Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

								  CUT TO:

	Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
	songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
	around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
	song. Everybody applauds.

	Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
	that he uses to announce dancers.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(announcer voice in Spanish)
		And now for your viewing pleasure. The
		Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
		of Evil. The most sinister woman to
		dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
		dogs, get on your knees, bow your
		heads and worship at the feet of
		SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

	The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
	notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

	The crowd hushes up.

	And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

	This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
	Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
	the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

	She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
	stage, but like she owned the world.

	And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
	world is proud to be her possession.

	All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
	Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
	Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
	accompanies from the table with the guitar.

	When the music builds to its explosive section.

	Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
	room.

	She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
	the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
	looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
	and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

	As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
	from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

	Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

	Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
	She STANDS OVER him.

	While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
	bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

	She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
	toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard in Spanish)
		Drink up.

	Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
	CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
	surveys.

	Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

	Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
	this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

	Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
	the beat with his guitar.

	Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
	over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
	Seth and company did to Chet.

	Richard continues to suck her toes.

	The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
	mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
	down at the seated Richard.

	She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
	mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
	OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
	from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
	applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
	and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
	none louder than Seth.

				SETH
		Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
		I call a fuckin' show!

	One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
	which she puts on.

	Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

				SETH
			(snapping his fingers)
		Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
		your new friend to join us?

				RICHARD
		Yeah.

				SETH
		Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

				RICHARD
			(looking up at Santanico)
		Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
		join us?

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard)
		Muy bien, gracias.

	Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

				SETH
		Richie, you lucky bastard!
			(to Santanico)
		Now, little lady, you could of just as
		easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
		You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
		arithmetic.

	The table laughs.

				SETH
		Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
		Riding Hood is walking through the
		forest and she comes across Little Bo
		Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
		"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
		crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
		is walking these woods and if he finds
		you he's gonna pull down your dress
		and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
		Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
		and taps a .357 Magnum she has
		holstered on her thigh and says: "No
		he won't."

	As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
	Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

				JACOB
			(to himself)
		Oh, shit.
			(to Seth)
		Seth --

	Seth waves him away.

				SETH
		Not now. So finally she comes across
		the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
		Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
		Riding Hood, you know better than to
		be walking around these woods alone.
		You know I'm just gonna have to pull
		down your dress and squeeze your
		titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
		whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
		it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
		says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
		me, just like the story says."

	Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
	Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
	anything --

	The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Chet in Spanish)
		Which one?

				CHET
			(pointing at Seth)
		This piece of shit broke my finger
		and my nose...
			(pointing at Richard)
		then this fag kicked me in the ribs
		while I was down.

	That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to The Gecko Brothers)
		Up!

				RICHARD
		Fuck off, ape man!

	Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
	the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
	his wounded shoulder.

	Santanico steps back from the table.

	Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
	Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
	Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
	and SLASHES Seth across the face.

	Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
	his laid open cheek.

	Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
	brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

	Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
	before he hits the floor.

	Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
	out of gunfire.

	The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
	they were doing.

	The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
	dancing.

	Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
	something.

	Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

	Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
	and puts it to his face.

				RICHARD
		How are you?

				SETH
		Scarred for life, that's how I am!

	Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

				SETH
		You thought it was pretty funny,
		didn't you?

	Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
	left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
	the crowd.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
		as dead as these fucks!

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

	SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

	The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
	waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
	to the floor, splattering.

	WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
	her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
	could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

	CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

	Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
	transformation.

	Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
	of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
	her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		Richie, look out!

	Before Richie can turn around.

	SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
	SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

	Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

	Seth turns to his brother's cry.

	He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
	a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
	deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
	about, trying to knock her off.

	Richard screams to Seth:

				RICHARD
		Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

	Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
	can't get a clear shot.

	Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

	Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
	rides him down to the floor.

	Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
	vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

	Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
	half way before he stops, saying:

				RICHARD
			(with his dying breath)
		Fucking Bitch!

	He tumbles over, a corpse.

				SETH
		Richie.

	Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
	Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
	their faces.

	The patrons scream.

	A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
	with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
	and yells:

				WHORE
		Dinner is served!

	The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
	the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
	and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
	turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
	VAMPIRES.

	The vamps attack.

	What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
	sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
	necks.

	Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
	Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
	The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
	monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
	anything.

	Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
	They hide and watch.

	Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
	too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
	motionless, watching what he can't believe.

	Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
	eyes POP OPEN.

	She RISES in her snake/dance way.

	Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

				SANTANICO
		Let's see if you taste as good as your
		brother.

	She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
	CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
	hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

	Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
	JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
	FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

	A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
	side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
	pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

	Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
	switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
	bar to the other.

	The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
	goes head to head with a stripper.

	The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
	close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
	vamp bitch blow for blow.

	Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
	and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
	on the wooden leg.

	FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
	appears, straight razor in hand.

	Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
	Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
	cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
	UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
	Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
	the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

	Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
	vampire's death scream.

	Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
	tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
	chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
	the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
	placed on his chest.

				SANTANICO
		I'm not gonna drain you completely.
		You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
		my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
		eat bugs because I order it. Because
		I don't think you're worthy of human
		blood, you'll feed on the blood of
		stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
		And at my command, you'll lick the dog
		shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
		be my dog, your new name will be
		"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

	SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
		 end over end.

	CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

	looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
	the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

	We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

	Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
	momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

	Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

	Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
	the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

	Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

	Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

				BIG EMILIO
		Noooooo!

	He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

	Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
	see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
	Jacob.

				SETH
		We may be in trouble.

	Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
	walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
	vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
	out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
	him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
	aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

	Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
	Seth and Jacob.

	Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
	weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

	Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
	wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
	look like a huge walking shark.

	Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, you, monkey man!

	Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

				SEX MACHINE
		Anything you gotta say to them, say
		to me first.

	Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
	effortlessly knocks them away.

	They both hit the ground.

	Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
	ahead."

	Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
	locomotive.

	Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
	huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
	Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
	buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
	who HITS the floor.

	Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
	BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
	vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
	savage beating.

				SEX MACHINE
		That's enough.

	Jacob and Seth stop.

	Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
	end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
	big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
	dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
	vamp.

	Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
	breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
	around his mouth.

	Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
	over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
	protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
	trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

				CHET
		You know what everybody says about me?
		I suck!

	Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
	her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
	his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
	off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
	his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
	up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

	GULP.

	Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
	moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
	mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
	jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
	He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
	all the while.

	Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
	their faces.

	Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
	of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

				CHET
		I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

	Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

				CHET
		Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
		pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

	He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
	vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
	staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

	By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
	vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
	customers have been butchered or drained.

	All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
	and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
	kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
	are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
	wooden stakes.

	The four human men group together. The four female vampires
	charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
	Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
	slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
	staked bodies hit the floor.

	Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
	side.

	They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
	taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

				FROST
		Ain't they supposed to burn up or
		something?

	At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
	everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
	the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
	light, which lasts only a split second.

	It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
	that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
	once lay.

	They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
	for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
	useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

	Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
	to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

	He takes his dead hand.

				SETH
		Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
		You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
		find peace there. I love you little
		brother, I'll miss ya bad.

	Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
	POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

				RICHARD
		I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
		love you, too.

	Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
	down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
	He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
	to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
	bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
	from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
	surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
	head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
	wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
	where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
	wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
	whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

				SETH
		Touch my brother with that stake,
		biker, and vampires won't need to
		suck your blood, they'll be able to
		lick it up off the floor.

				SEX MACHINE
		He ain't your brother no more.

				SETH
		That's a matter of opinion, and I
		don't give a fuck about your's.

	Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
	the ground.

				JACOB
		Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

	Seth aims his gun at the group.

				SETH
		Shut up!

	Richard's giggling.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, shut up.

	Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
	out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

				SETH
		Hold him down.

	The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

				SETH
		Richie, here's the peace in death I
		could never give you in life.

	Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
	his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
	heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
	body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
	Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
	He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
	of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
	the bar.

				KATE
		Are you okay?

				SETH
		Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
		world's my oyster, except for the
		fact that I just rammed a wooden
		stake in my brother's heart because
		he turned into a vampire, even
		though I don't believe in vampires.
		Aside from that unfortunate business,
		everything's hunky-dory.

				KATE
		I'm really sorry.

				SETH
		Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
		a chance you'd feed us to them!

				JACOB
		Then why didn't I?

	Jacob walks over to Seth.

				JACOB
		I saved your life. I didn't have to,
		but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
		brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
		sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
		gonna get out of this we need each
		other. And we need you sober and
		thinking, not drunk and...

	As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
	grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
	identify it.

				JACOB
		What the hell is that?

				FROST
		At first I just thought it was birds.

				SEX MACHINE
		No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
		Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
		gnaw.

	Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

				SETH
		It's bats.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
	hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
	inside.


	INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
	along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
	scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
	do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
	claws poke their way through.

				JACOB
		Give me a hand!

	Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
	the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
	items to help secure and barricade the door.

	As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
	the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
	open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
	activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
	friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
	putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
	POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
	room in her direction.

				SEX MACHINE
		Watch out, girly!

	The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
	scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
	she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
	others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
	Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
	As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
	of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
	vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
	and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
	SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
	the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
	vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
	of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
	heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

	At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
	position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
	ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

				SEX MACHINE
			(mumbling to himself)
		Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

	The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
	Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
	feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
	flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
	SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
	a loop.

	As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
	on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
	stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
	by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
	lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
	raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
	vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
	which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

				SEX MACHINE
		Fire!

	Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		We'll put this out. You stake the rest
		of these fuckers.

				SEX MACHINE
		Way ahead of ya.
			(to Kate)
		What's your name, girly?

				KATE
		Kate, what's yours?

				SEX MACHINE
		Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
		Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
		fuckers.

	Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
	work STAKING the dead bodies.

	Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
	whatever else is at hand.

	A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
	over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
	in front of the window.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		We got a problem!

	Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
	direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
	a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
	SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
	body through the newly formed hole.

	Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
	point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

	The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
	his head back through the hole.

	Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
	when...

	WHAM !

	The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
	cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
	LANDING HARD on his back.

	Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
	of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
	RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
	bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
	its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
	inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

				SETH
		Get this bastard off of me!

	Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
	GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

	Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
	preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
	dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
	body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
	squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
	down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
	Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
	his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
	get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

	Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
	front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
	while, then...

	BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
	fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
	against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
	bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
	cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
	heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
	FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

	Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
	window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
	the bat-thing.

	Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
	exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
	to try and claw their way in.

				JACOB
		Is everybody okay?

	Everyone mutters "yeah."

				JACOB
		Okay, does anybody here know what's
		going on?

				SETH
		Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
		a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
		trying to get inside and suck our
		fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
		simple. And I don't wanna hear any
		bullshit about "I don't believe in
		vampires" because I don't fuckin'
		believe in vampires either. But I do
		believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
		and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
		vampires! Now, does everybody agree
		we're dealin' with vampires.

	Everybody agrees.

				SETH
		You too, preacher?

				JACOB
		I'm like you. I don't believe in
		vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

				SETH
		Good for you. Now, since we all
		believe we're dealing with vampires,
		what do we know about vampires?
		Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
		cross?

				JACOB
		In the Winnebago.

				SETH
		In other words, no.

				SCOTT
		What are you talking about? We got
		crosses all over the place. All you
		gotta do is put two sticks together
		and you got a cross.

				SEX MACHINE
		He's right. Peter Cushing does that
		all the time.

				SETH
		I don't know about that. In order for
		it to have any power, I think it's
		gotta be an official crucifix.

				JACOB
		What's an official cross? Some piece
		of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
		official? If a cross works against
		vampires, it's not the cross itself,
		it's what the cross represents. The
		cross is a symbol of holiness.

				SETH
		Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
		covered, moving right along, what
		else?

				FROST
		Wooden stakes in the heart been
		workin' pretty good so far.

				SEX MACHINE
		Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
		forget, does silver do anything to a
		vampire?

				SCOTT
		That's werewolves.

				SEX MACHINE
		I know silver bullets are werewolves.
		But I'm pretty sure silver has some
		sort of effect on vampires.

				KATE
		Does anybody have any silver?

				ALL
		No.

				KATE
		Then who cares?

				SCOTT
		When's sunrise?

	Jacob looks at his watch.

				JACOB
		About two hours from now.

				KATE
		So all we have to do is get by for a
		few more hours and then we can walk
		right out the front door.

				SEX MACHINE
		Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
		barricades, that door, those plastered
		windows and these walls will last two
		more hours with those bat fucks
		fuckin' with 'em.

				JACOB
		Has anybody here read a real book
		about vampires, or are we just
		remembering what a movie said? I mean
		a real book.

				SEX MACHINE
		You mean like a Time-Life book?

	Everybody laughs.

				FROST
			(in a cowboy voice)
		John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
		shot a man for snorin'.

				JACOB
		I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
		what do we know about these vampires?

				SETH
		Aside from they're thirsty.

				FROST
		Well, one thing, they might got super
		human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

				JACOB
		Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
		Santanico didn't kill her, but it
		didn't feel too good either.

				SEX MACHINE
		Another thing, you try and ram a
		broken chair leg in a human, you
		better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
		The human body is one rough-tough
		machine. But these vamps got soft
		bodies. The texture of their skin is
		softer, mushier. You can push shit
		right through 'em. Conceivably, if
		you hit one hard enough, you could
		take their fuckin' head off.

				SCOTT
		You could take their head off.

				SETH
		Actually, our best weapon against
		these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
			(he points at Jacob)
		He's a preacher.

	Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

				SETH
		As far as God's concerned, we might
		just as well be a piece of fuckin'
		shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
		one problem, his faith ain't what it
		used to be.

	Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
	Jacob stands over him.

				JACOB
		I've had enough of your taunts.

	Seth looks up from the floor.

				SETH
		I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
		faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
		to us. But a man who's a servant of
		God can grab a cross, shove it in
		these monsters' asses. A servant of
		God can bless the tap water and turn
		it into a weapon.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I know why you lost your faith. How
		could true holiness exist if your wife
		can be taken away from you and your
		children? Now, I always said God can
		kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
		my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
		ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
		what's out there trying to get in
		here is pure evil straight from hell.
		And if there is a hell, and those
		monsters are from it, there's got to
		be a heaven. Now which are you, a
		faithless preacher or a mean,
		mother fuckin' servant of God?

	Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
	sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

				JACOB
		I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
		God.

	The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
	sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
	It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
	they're in.

				KATE
		I don't know if I can take two hours
		of that noise.

				FROST
		You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
		no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
		hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
		with only the rotting corpses of your
		friends to keep you company?

				JACOB
		What are you talking about?

				FROST
		Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
		behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
		with my entire squad dead. They
		thought they killed everybody, and
		except for me, they were right. But it
		wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
		blew up right next to me, that's why
		I'm so pretty.

	They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
	the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
	possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
	listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
	hour...

	As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
	the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
	can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
	doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
	say:

				MALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
	around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
	hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

				FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		Stop fucking saying that!

				TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst!

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		That bite weren't nothin'. It just
		hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
		all. It barely punched the skin.

	Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
	biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
	all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
	many voices, male, female, children saying:

				VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

	Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
	in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
	and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
	actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
	has turned into a vampire.

	The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

				FROST
		...and then when I came back to my
		senses, I realized I had killed the
		entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
		My bayonet had blood and chunks of
		yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
		shish kabob. And to this day I don't
		have the slightest idea how I --

	Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

				SEX MACHINE
		THIRST!

	Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
	into his neck.

	The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

	Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
	pulling.

	Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
	SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

	Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

	Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

	Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
	bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

	Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
	bleeding neck.

				FROST
		I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

	Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
	sack of potatoes.

	He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
	table.

	Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
	leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		You're dead, mother fucker! You're
		gonna bite me! You just turned me
		into a vampire, asshole!

				SEX MACHINE
		What are you gonna do about it?

	Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
	straight at Sex Machine.

	Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
	pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

	Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
	loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
	floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
	COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
	hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
	through the air.

	Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

				SETH
		Oh shit!

	Jacob sees.

				JACOB
		Good lord!

	Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
	and CRASHES through it.

	Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
	bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
	hand and runs for the backroom.

	Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
	ground.

	Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
	who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
	back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
	ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
	door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
	as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
	howls and snaps in fury.

	Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
	.45 in its big mouth.

				SETH
		You wanna suck something, suck on
		this!

	He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
	the wall.

	Kate yells:

				KATE
		We have to go back for Daddy!

				SETH
		Daddy's dead.

				KATE
		Noooo!

	She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
	and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
	against the wall.

				SCOTT
		He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
		too far away. If flinging that door
		and filling this room with those
		bat-things would save him, I'd fling
		it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
		into one of them.

				SETH
		He needs our help!

				SCOTT
		He's beyond our help. You saw him get
		bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
		You can't help him. I've got no one
		left to lose but you. I can't be alone
		again. We're sticking together.

	Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


	INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

	Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
	appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
	bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
	restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
	his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
	the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

	The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
	holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
	whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
	in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
	god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
	stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
	in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
	As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
	lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
	candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
	repugnant sight trip him up.

	Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

				JACOB
		Open the door.

	The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
	shut.

	Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
	bloody arm.

	When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

				SETH
		Did he...?

				JACOB
		Yep.

	Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
	over tables and cussing a blue streak.

				SETH
		Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
		vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
		Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

	Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
	creatures on the other side.

				SETH
		You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
		gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
		you godless pieces of shit!

				JACOB
			(to Seth)
		You bet your sweet ass you are, and
		I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
		got much time.

	Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

				KATE
		You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
		daddy?

				JACOB
		No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
		I'm already dead.

	Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
	dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
	kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

				JACOB
			(to his children)
		Children, listen to me. I love you two
		more than anybody. And I just want you 
		to know you've made me proud all your
		lives. But never more so than tonight.
		And I wish we could sit here and cry
		till I pass on, but we can't. Because
		I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
		turn into a monster. And when I do,
		I'm going to be dangerous. But before
		that happens, just know I love you.
			(to Seth and the kids)
		Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
		thirty minutes our friends outside
		will bust in this door. And I'll
		probably turn into a vampire within
		the hour. Now, you have two choices.
		You can wait for me to turn, then deal
		with me, then wait for them to burst
		inside here and the three of you will
		deal with them. Or, we can kick open
		that door and the four of us can hit
		'em with everything we have, and carve
		a path right through 'em to front
		entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
		we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
		them, I scared them, I took them off
		guard. But they're going to get
		unconfused, they're going to get
		unscared, they're going to get
		together and they're going to hit that
		door like a ton of bricks. And when
		that moment arrives, we gotta be
		ready.

	Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
	with boxes and crates.

				JACOB
		What's this stuff?

				SETH
		My guess is that this little dive's
		been feeding on nomad road waifs like
		bikers and truckers for a longtime.
		This is probably some of the
		shipments they stole off the trucks.

				JACOB
		Well, I say lets tear this place apart
		for weapons. So when they burst
		through that door, we'll make 'em wish
		they never did.

				SETH
		I don't give a shit about living or
		dying anymore. I just want to send as
		many of these devils back to hell as
		I can.

				JACOB
		Amen.

	MONTAGE

	The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
	lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
	teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
	doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
	a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
	are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
	balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
	shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

	Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

	Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
	backroom sink.

	Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
	in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

	Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
	getting their courage back.

	Kate makes water balloons.

	Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
	attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

	Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
	turning it into holy water.

	Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
	The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
	begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
	The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
	pounding, squeaking and screaming.

	Finally they're ready.

	Jacob turns to his kids.

				JACOB
		Before we go any further, I need you
		three to promise me something. I'll
		fight with you to the bitter end,
		but when I turn into one of them, I
		won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
		lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
		promise you'll take me down, no
		different from the rest.

	The kids can't say the words.

				SETH
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Kate, Scott?

				KATE
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Scott?

				SCOTT
		Yeah, I promise.

	Jacob doesn't believe them.

				JACOB
		Why don't I believe you?
			(he picks up the .45)
		I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
		want you to swear to God that you'll
		kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
		just kill myself right now. Now,
		since you need me I think you better
		swear. Kate, do you swear to God
		that when I turn into one of the
		undead, you'll kill me?

	Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
	temple.

				JACOB
		Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
		only gonna count to five. One...two...
		three... four...

				KATE
		Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

				JACOB
		Not good enough, swear to God.

				KATE
		I swear to God, our father, that when
		you change into one of the undead, I
		will kill you.

				JACOB
		Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
		less time, so I'm only giving you the
		count of three. One...

				SCOTT
		You don't believe in suicide.

				JACOB
		It's not suicide if you're already
		dead. Two...

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
		I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

				JACOB
		Thank you, son.

				SETH
		Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
		fuckin' vampires.


	INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

	The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
	down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
	the door.

	Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
	and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
	grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
	stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
	the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
	into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

	What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
	Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
	watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
	like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
	starting up the jackhammer.

				SETH
		Kill 'em all!

	Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

	The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
	flesh.

	The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
	forward.

	They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
	the door.

	Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
	in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
	green vamp blood.

	Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
	and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
	other.

	Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

	Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
	toss them into the crowd.

	They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
	in pain.

	From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
	HURLS toward the group.

	Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

	The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

	Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
	the hammer stake into vampire chests.

	The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
	junk.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		Why did they block the door again?

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		To keep the daylight out! This is
		where they sleep! Get to the door!

	Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
	half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
	above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
	Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
	off the ground.

	Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
	he CRASHES into a table.

	The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
	sticking out of his chest, dead.

	Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
	screams:

				KATE
		Seth!

	Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
	on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

				SETH
		Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
		and feel all right!

	Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		I'm going for 'em!

				JACOB
		No!

				KATE
		Everybody goes home!

	Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
	one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
	Seth's direction.

				KATE
			(screaming)
		Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

	Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
	burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
	couple of water balloons and a stake.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Watch my back!

				SETH
		Anytime.

	Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
	bar.

	Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
	fiery death.

	Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

	As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
	can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
	to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
	vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
	happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
	His eyes are yellow.

	Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

	Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
	sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
	murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

	Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
	SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

	The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
	of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

	Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
	up to fire.

	A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
	with the boy he once called his son.

	Scott's eyes turn to steel.

				SCOTT
		I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
		name.

	He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
	creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
	head bursts into flames, then explodes.

	From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
	cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

				SETH
		Fight now, cry later.

	Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
	with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

	A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
	it bites into him. He drops the .45.

	Kate sees Scott get bit.

				KATE
		Oh my god.

	Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
	Scott screams.

				KATE
		You bastards!

	She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

	Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
	Scott is in agony.

				SCOTT
		Kill me, Kate! 

	Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
	up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
	times.

	One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
	all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

	The remaining vamps approach.

	All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
	balloon.

				SETH
		How many bullets left, kid?

				KATE
		Not many.

				SETH
		Well, when you run out of weapons,
		just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
		sing for their supper.

	The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
	things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
	throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
	bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

	The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
	them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
	holding the .45, arm outstretched.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Should I use the last bullets on us?

				SETH
		You use 'em on the first couple of
		these parasites that try to bite you.

	The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
	on the face of an approaching vampire.

	Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
	vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

	Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
	through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
	vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

				SETH
		Shoot more holes!

	Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
	behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
	Seth with a safe, lighted area.

	The .45's empty.

	The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
	able to get at them.

	The two survivors hold hands, when...

	All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
	from the outside.

	The vamps look towards it in horror.

	From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
	Spanish accent.

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
		there?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Carlos!
			(in Spanish)
		Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
		in!

				CARLOS (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
		Hurry, hurry!

	The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
	around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
	each other.

	The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
	the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
	door.

	The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

	The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
	are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

	The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
	MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
	in fright.

	Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
	hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
	hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
	Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
	combust in fiery explosions.

	The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

	Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
	door into the parking lot.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

	Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
	them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
	Carlos's Mercedes.

				CARLOS
			(to Seth)
		What the fuck was going on in there?

	Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
	breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
	kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

				CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

				SETH
		Why the fuck, outta all the god
		forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
		have us rendezvous at that place?

				CARLOS
		I don't know, one place's as good as
		another.

				SETH
		Have you ever been there before?

				CARLOS
		No, but I passed by it a couple of
		times. It's out in the middle of
		nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
		so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
		And it's open from dusk till dawn.
		You said meet you in the morning.

				SETH
		Well, because you picked that place
		out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
		And this girl's family's dead.

	Carlos stands up again.

				CARLOS
		I'm sorry to hear that. What were
		they, psychos?

				SETH
		Did they look like psychos? They
		were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
		explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
		don't care how crazy they are.

	Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
	themselves again.

				CARLOS
		Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
		to you?

				SETH
		You can't, but fifteen percent instead
		of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
		good start.

				CARLOS
		Twenty-eight.

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
		dead and he's not coming back, and
		it's all your fault. Twenty.


	They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

				SETH AND CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Twenty-five.

	Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
	to a red 1990 Porsche 911.


				CARLOS
		You like the car?

				SETH
		I said new, this is an '90.

				CARLOS
		It's hardly been used at all. I got it
		from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
		times in as many years. Swear to God.
		That's like new.

				SETH
		So do I just follow you?

				CARLOS
		Yeah, follow us.


				SETH
		So let's do it.

				CARLOS
			(to Danny and Manny)
		Vamanos!

	Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

	Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

	Kate stands alone.

	The whole desert seems between them.

	So much to say ... but no words.

				SETH
		I'm sorry.

				KATE
		Me too.

	Long pause.

				SETH
		See ya.

				KATE
		Later.

	Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
	says behind him:

				KATE (O.S.)
		Seth.

	Seth turns around.

				KATE
		You want some company?

	Seth smiles.

				SETH
		Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
		I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

	He blows her a kiss across the desert.

	She blows one back.

	Seth's in his car and GONE.

	Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
	begins her long walk home.

	THEME OF MOVIE BEGINS POUNDING

 	THE END





<|endoftext|>


	THE GODFATHER


	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
	background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
	simple words in white lettering:

				  THE GODFATHER

	While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America."
	Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
	man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
	emotion.

				BONASERA
		America has made my fortune.

	As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

				BONASERA
		I raised my daughter in the American
		fashion; I gave her freedom, but
		taught her never to dishonor her
		family.  She found a boy friend,
		not an Italian.  She went to the
		movies with him, stayed out late.
		Two months ago he took her for a
		drive, with another boy friend.
		They made her drink whiskey and
		then they tried to take advantage
		of her.  She resisted; she kept her
		honor.  So they beat her like an
		animal.  When I went to the hospital
		her nose was broken, her jaw was
		shattered and held together by
		wire, and she could not even weep
		because of the pain.

	He can barely speak; he is weeping now.

				BONASERA
		I went to the Police like a good
		American.  These two boys were
		arrested and brought to trial.  The
		judge sentenced them to three years
		in prison, and suspended the
		sentence.  Suspended sentence!
		They went free that very day.  I
		stood in the courtroom like a fool,
		and those bastards, they smiled at
		me.  Then I said to my wife, for
		Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

	By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office
	in his home.

	The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with
	patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the
	shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small
	table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands
	impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a
	glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and
	voices of many people outside.

				DON CORLEONE
		Bonasera, we know each other for
		years, but this is the first time
		you come to me for help.  I don't
		remember the last time you invited
		me to your house for coffee...even
		though our wives are friends.

				BONASERA
		What do you want of me?  I'll give
		you anything you want, but do what
		I ask!

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is that Bonasera?

	BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  You ask for too much.

				BONASERA
		I ask for Justice.

				DON CORLEONE
		The Court gave you justice.

				BONASERA
		An eye for an eye!

				DON CORLEONE
		But your daughter is still alive.

				BONASERA
		Then make them suffer as she
		suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

	Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

				DON CORLEONE
		You never think to protect yourself
		with real friends.  You think it's
		enough to be an American.  All
		right, the Police protects you,
		there are Courts of Law, so you
		don't need a friend like me.
		But now you come to me and say Don
		Corleone, you must give me justice.
		And you don't ask in respect or
		friendship.  And you don't think to
		call me Godfather; instead you come
		to my house on the day my daughter
		is to be married and you ask me to
		do murder...for money.

				BONASERA
		America has been good to me...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then take the justice from the
		judge, the bitter with the sweet,
		Bonasera.  But if you come to me
		with your friendship, your loyalty,
		then your enemies become my enemies,
		and then, believe me, they would
		fear you...

	Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

				BONASERA
		Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  From me you'll get Justice.

				BONASERA
		Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Some day, and that day may never
		come, I would like to call upon you
		to do me a service in return.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There
	are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
	and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and
	countless tables covered with food and wine.

	DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
	son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
	the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
	hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
	children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry
	with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
	bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

	The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
	MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
	and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
	bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into
	the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

				DON CORLEONE
		Where's Michael?

				SONNY
		He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

				DON CORLEONE
		Then the picture will wait for him.

	Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves
	back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
	direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns
	it.  Then he moves to his wife.

				SONNY
		Sandra, watch the kids.  They're
		running wild.

				SANDRA
		You watch yourself.

	HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine
	barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM
	crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is
	next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

	EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,
	working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out
	of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers
	down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter
	coming from the party in the distance.

	A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

	BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the
	watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to
	embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden
	bumpers.

	PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping
	bellies with the ladies.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie...wine...WINE.

	He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
	PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings
	it to him.

				PAULIE
		You look terrif on the floor!

				CLEMENZA
		What are you, a dance judge?  Go do
		your job; take a walk around the
		neighborhood... see everything is
		okay.

	PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps
	back into the dance.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.

	TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-
	OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his
	enormous brown shoes.

	The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out
	of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by
	CLEMENZA and PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Buddy, this is a private party.

	The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the
	sedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
	The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,
	without saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the
	ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,
	and another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the
	walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the
	dark study.

				NAZORINE
		...a fine boy from Sicily, captured
		by the American Army, and sent to
		New Jersey as a prisoner of war...

				DON CORLEONE
		Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I
		can do.

				NAZORINE
		Now that the war is over, Enzo,
		this boy is being repatriated to
		Italy.  And you see, Godfather...
			  (he wrings his hands,
			  unable to express himself)
		He...my daughter...they...

				DON CORLEONE
		You want him to stay in this country.

				NAZORINE
		Godfather, you understand everything.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, what we need is an Act of
		Congress to allow Enzo to become a
		citizen.

				NAZORINE
			  (impressed)
		An Act of Congress!

				HAGEN
			  (nodding)
		It will cost.

	The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE
	nods.

				NAZORINE
		Is that all?  Godfather, thank
		you...
			  (backing out, enthusiastically)
		Oh, wait till you see the cake I
		made for your beautiful daughter!

	NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
	DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

				HAGEN
		Who do I give this job to?

	The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

				DON CORLEONE
		Not to one of our paisans...give it
		to a Jew Congressman in another
		district.  Who else is on the list
		for today?

	The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting
	to see him.

				HAGEN
		Francesco Nippi.  His nephew has
		been refused parole.  A bad case.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		His father worked with you in the
		freight yards when you were young.

	LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		He's not on the list, but Luca
		Brasi wants to see you.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is it necessary?

				HAGEN
		You understand him better than
		anyone.

	The DON nods to this.  Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,
	leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally
	stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,
	following them.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces
	her to his GIRL.

	EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,
	burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She
	is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and
	the vitality.

				KAY
		I've never seen anything like it.

				MICHAEL
		I told you I had a lot of relatives.

	KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
	We see what she sees:

	Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine
	barrels.

				KAY
			  (amused)
		Michael, what are those men doing?

				MICHAEL
		They're waiting to see my father.

				KAY
		They're talking to themselves.

				MICHAEL
		They're going to talk to my father,
		which means they're going to ask
		him for something, which means they
		better get it right.

				KAY
		Why do they bother him on a day
		like this?

				MICHAEL
		Because they know that no Sicilian
		will refuse a request on his
		daughter's wedding day.

	EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)

	CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her
	overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He
	is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
	She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from
	him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white
	envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she
	holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one
	of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,
	where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
	CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the
	bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the
	things hold.

	Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

				CARLO
			  (whispered)
		Cut it out, Connie.

	The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,
	is fat with money.

				PAULIE (O.S.)
		What do you think?  Twenty grand?

	A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a
	prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking
	eyes from the purse.

				PAULIE
		Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty,
		thirty grand in small bills cash in
		that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if
		this was somebody else's wedding!

	SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY
	MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he
	glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with
	some WOMEN.

	He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

	SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

				WOMAN
		Is it true what they say about your
		husband, Sandra?

	SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and
	further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
	Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
	SONNY and LUCY are gone.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)

	The empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY
	surreptitiously steps out.

	She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,
	motioning for her to come up.

	She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL.

				KAY
			  (in a spooky low tone)
		Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a
		relative?

	She has picked out LUCA BRASI.

				MICHAEL
		No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You
		wouldn't like him.

				KAY
			  (Excited)
		Who is he?

				MICHAEL
			  (Sizing her up)
		You really want to know?

				KAY
		Yes.  Tell me.

				MICHAEL
		You like spaghetti?

				KAY
		You know I love spaghetti.

				MICHAEL
		Then eat your spaghetti and I'll
		tell you a Luca Brasi story.

	She starts to eat her spaghetti.

	She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

				MICHAEL
		Once upon a time, about fifteen
		years ago some people wanted to
		take over my father's olive oil
		business.  They had Al Capone send
		some men in from Chicago to kill my
		father, and they almost did.

				KAY
		Al Capone!

				MICHAEL
		My Father sent Luca Brasi after
		them.  He tied the two Capone men
		hand and foot, and stuffed small
		bath towels into their mouths.
		Then he took an ax, and chopped one
		man's feet off...

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		Then the legs at the knees...

				KAY
		Michael you're trying to scare me...

				MICHAEL
		Then the thighs where they joined
		the torso.

				KAY
		Michael, I don't want to hear
		anymore...

				MICHAEL
		Then Luca turned to the other man...

				KAY
		Michael, I love you.

				MICHAEL
		...who out of sheer terror had
		swallowed the bath towel in his
		mouth and suffocated.

	The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a
	tall story.

				KAY
		I never know when you're telling me
		the truth.

				MICHAEL
		I told you you wouldn't like him.

				KAY
		He's coming over here!

	LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near
	their table.

				MICHAEL
		Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
		Adams.

				KAY
			  (having survived LUCA)
		How do you do.

				MICHAEL
		My brother, Tom Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Hello Kay.  Your father's inside,
		doing some business.
			  (privately)
		He's been asking for you.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks Tom.

	HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously
	following.

				KAY
		If he's your brother, why does he
		have a different name?

				MICHAEL
		My brother Sonny found him living
		in the streets when he was a kid,
		so my father took him in.  He's a
		good lawyer.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the
	YOUNG COUPLE.

				LUCA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...

	THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves
	forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his
	jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes
	a formal speech.

				LUCA
			  (with difficulty)
		Don Corleone...I am honored, and
		grateful...that you invited me to
		your home...on the wedding day of
		your...daughter.
		May their first child...be a
		masculine child.  I pledge my never
		ending loyalty.
			  (he offers the envelope)
		For your daughter's bridal purse.

				DON CORLEONE
		Thank you, Luca, my most valued
		friend.

	THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
	tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

				LUCA
		Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I
		know you are busy.

	He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
	the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes
	more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'm sure it's the most generous
		gift today.

				HAGEN
		The Senator called--apologized for
		not coming personally, but said
		you'd understand.  Also, some of
		the Judges...they've all sent gifts.
		And another call from Virgil
		Sollozzo.

	DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

				HAGEN
		The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo
		has contacts in Turkey for the
		poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
		process down to morphine or up to
		heroin.  Also he has access to this
		country.  He's coming to us for
		financial help, and some sort of
		immunity from the law.  For that we
		get a piece of the action, I
		couldn't find out how much.
		Sollozzo is vouched for by the
		Tattaglia family, and they may have
		a piece of the action.  They call
		Sollozzo the Turk.
		He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
		and is suppose to have a Turkish
		wife and kids.  He's suppose to be
		very quick with the knife, or was,
		when he was younger.  Only in
		matters of business and with some
		reasonable complaint.  Also he has
		an American wife and three children
		and he is a good family man.

	THE DON nods.

				HAGEN
		He's his own boss, and very
		competent.

				DON CORLEONE
		And with prison record.

				HAGEN
		Two terms; one in Italy, one in the
		United States.  He's known to the
		Government as a top narcotics man.
		That could be a plus for us; he
		could never get immunity to testify.

				DON CORLEONE
		When did he call?

				HAGEN
		This morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		On a day like this.  Consiglero, do
		you also have in your notes the the
		Turk made his living from
		Prostitution before the war, like
		the Tattaglias do now.  Write that
		down before you forget it.  The
		Turk will wait.

	We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers
	from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style.

				DON CORLEONE
		What that?  It sounds like Johnny.

	He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the
	room with light.

				DON CORLEONE
		It is Johnny.  He came all the way
		from California to be at the wedding.

				HAGEN
		Should I bring him in.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You
		see?  He is a good godson.

				HAGEN
		It's been two years.  He's probably
		in trouble again.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and
	excitement of the wedding GUESTS.

				KAY
		I didn't know your family knew
		Johnny Fontane.

				MICHAEL
		Sure.

				KAY
		I used to come down to New York
		whenever he sang at the Capitol and
		scream my head off.

				MICHAEL
		He's my father's godson; he owes
		him his whole career.

	JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
	They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

				DON CORLEONE
		My Godson has come three thousand
		miles to do us honor and no one
		thinks to wet his throat.

	At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who
	takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

				JOHNNY
		I kept trying to call you after my
		divorce and Tom always said you
		were busy.  When I got the Wedding
		invitation I knew you weren't sore
		at me anymore, Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Can I do something for you still?
		You're not too rich, or too famous
		that I can't help you?

				JOHNNY
		I'm not rich anymore, Godfather,
		and...my career, I'm almost washed
		up...

	He's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come
	with him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to
	HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Santino to come in with us.
		He should hear some things.

	They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN glances up the staircase.

				HAGEN
		Sonny?

	Then he goes up.

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her
	gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing
	against the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of
	petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

				LUCY
		Sonnyeeeeeeee.

	Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his
	body.  But there is a knocking as well.  They stop, freeze
	in that position.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, you in there?

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside, HAGEN by the door.

				HAGEN
		The old man wants you; Johnny's
		here...he's got a problem.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		Okay.  One minute.

	HAGEN hesitates.  We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the
	door again.  TOM leaves.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

				DON CORLEONE
		ACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in
		Heaven, is it possible you turned
		out no better than a Hollywood
		finocchio.

	Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON
	smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still
	adjusting his clothes.

				DON CORLEONE
		All right, Hollywood...Now tell me
		about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta
		who won't let you work.

				JOHNNY
		He owns the studio.  Just a month
		ago he bought the movie rights to
		this book, a best seller.  And the
		main character is a guy just like
		me.  I wouldn't even have to act,
		just be myself.

	The DON is silent, stern.

				DON CORLEONE
		You take care of your family?

				JOHNNY
		Sure.

	He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as
	he can.

				DON CORLEONE
		You look terrible.  I want you to
		eat well, to rest.  And spend time
		with your family.  And then, at the
		end of the month, this big shot
		will give you the part you want.

				JOHNNY
		It's too late.  All the contracts
		have been signed, they're almost
		ready to shoot.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
	to hurt.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now go back to the party and leave
		it to me.

	He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		When does my daughter leave with
		her bridegroom?

				HAGEN
		They'll cut the cake in a few
		minutes...leave right after that.
		Your new son-in-law, do we give him
		something important?

				DON CORLEONE
		No, give him a living.  But never
		let him know the family's business.
		What else, Tom?

				HAGEN
		I've called the hospital; they've
		notified Consiglere Genco's family
		to come and wait.  He won't last
		out the night.

	This saddens the DON.  He sighs.

				DON CORLEONE
		Genco will wait for me.  Santino,
		tell your brothers they will come
		with me to the hospital to see
		Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big
		car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

				SONNY
		And Michael?

				DON CORLEONE
		All my sons.
			  (to HAGEN)
		Tom, I want you to go to California
		tonight.  Make the arrangements.
		But don't leave until I come back
		from the hospital and speak to you.
		Understood?

				HAGEN
		Understood.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over
	the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels
	in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most
	extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument
	of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they
	begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,
	in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and
	kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks
	hitting five hundred glasses.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Silence.

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A
	single black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the
	driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who
	sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

				DON CORLEONE
		Will your girl friend get back to
		the city all right?

				MICHAEL
		Tom said he'd take care of it.

	The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through
	the gate of the great Corleone Mall.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

	A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can
	see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but
	all plump and dressed in black.

	DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the
	DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.  MICHAEL
	stops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one
	another for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts
	his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's
	uniform.

				DON CORLEONE
		What was this for?

				MICHAEL
		For bravery.

				DON CORLEONE
		And this?

				MICHAEL
		For killing a man.

				DON CORLEONE
		What miracles you do for strangers.

				MICHAEL
		I fought for my country.  It was my
		choice.

				DON CORLEONE
		And now, what do you choose to do?

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to finish school.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  When you are finished, come
		and talk to me.  I have hopes for
		you.

	Again they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns,
	and continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then
	follows.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR
	VIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (whispered)
		Genco, I've brought my sons to pay
		their respects.  And look, even
		Johnny Fontane, all the way from
		Hollywood.

	GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE
	takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around
	his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

				GENCO
		Godfather, Godfather, it's your
		daughter's wedding day, you cannot
		refuse me.  Cure me, you have the
		power.

				DON CORLEONE
		I have no such power...but Genco,
		don't fear death.

				GENCO
			  (with a sly wink)
		It's been arranged, then?

				DON CORLEONE
		You blaspheme.  Resign yourself.

				GENCO
		You need your old Consigliere.  Who
		will replace me?
			  (suddenly)
		Stay with me Godfather.  Help me
		meet death.  If he sees you, he
		will be frightened and leave me in
		peace.  You can say a word, pull a
		few strings, eh?  We'll outwit that
		bastard as we outwitted all those
		others.
			  (clutching his hand)
		Godfather, don't betray me.

	The DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do.
	He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and
	whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	FADE IN:

	The interior of a non-stop Constellation.  HAGEN is one of
	the very few passengers on this late flight.  He looks like
	any young lawyer on a business trip.  He is tired from the
	difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed
	during the wedding.  On the seat next to him is an enormous,
	bulging briefcase.  He closes his eyes.

	INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)

	The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.  CARLO is in his
	undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the
	envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the
	contents.  CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble
	bathroom.  She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and
	tries to get his interest.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE in his office.  LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Luca, I am worried about this man
		Sollozzo.  Find out what you can,
		through the Tattaglias.  Let them
		believe you could be tempted away
		from the Corleone Family, if the
		right offer was made.  Learn what
		he has under his fingernails...

	INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)

	The hallway of an apartment building.  SONNY enters, climbs
	two steps at a time.  He knocks, and then whispers.

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling
	him into the apartment.

	INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI's tiny room.  He is partly dressed.  He kneels
	and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked
	trunk.  He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof
	vest.  He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then
	puts on his shirt and jacket.  He takes his gun, quickly
	disassembles, checks, and reassembles it.  And leaves.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.

	INT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New
	Hampshire.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty
	subway train.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN on the Constellation.  He reaches into his briefcase,
	and takes out several pictures and papers.

	One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm
	in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a
	lovely young child star to his immediate right.

	HAGEN considers other papers.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
	He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

				DON CORLEONE
		Remember my new Consigliere, a
		lawyer with his briefcase can steal
		more than a hundred men with guns.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)

	JACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,
	armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate,
	and TOM enters.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal
	gardens, martinis in hand.

				WOLTZ
		You should have told me your boss
		was Corleone, Tom, I had to check
		you out.  I thought you were just
		some third rate hustler Johnny was
		running in to bluff me.
			  (a piece of statuary)
		Florence, thirteenth century.
		Decorated the garden of a king.

	They cross the garden and head toward the stables.

				WOLTZ
		I'm going to show you something
		beautiful.

	They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a
	huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM."
	TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they
	rise as WOLTZ approaches.

				WOLTZ
		You like horses?  I like horses, I
		love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive
		Racehorses.

	The animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him
	with true love in his voice.

				WOLTZ
		Khartoum...Kartoum...You are
		looking at six hundred thousand
		dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even
		Russian Czars never paid that kind
		of dough for a single horse.  But
		I'm not going to race him I'm going
		to put him out to Stud.

	INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,
	attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the
	walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

				HAGEN
		Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
		That is very close, a very sacred
		religious relationship.

				WOLTZ
		Okay, but just tell him this is one
		favor I can't give.  But he should
		try me again on anything else.

				HAGEN
		He never asks a second favor when
		he has been refused the first.
		Understood?

				WOLTZ
		You smooth son of a bitch, let me
		lay it on the line for you, and
		your boss.  Johnny Fontane never
		gets that movie.  I don't care how
		many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball
		Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

				HAGEN
		I'm German-Irish.

				WOLTZ
		Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny
		will never get that part because I
		hate that pinko punk and I'm going
		to run him out of the Movies.  And
		I'll tell you why.  He ruined one
		of Woltz Brothers' most valuable
		proteges.  For five years I had
		this girl under training; singing
		lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing
		lessons!  We spent hundreds of
		thousands of dollars--I was going
		to make her a star.  I'll be even
		more frank, just to show you that
		I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it
		wasn't all dollars and cents.  That
		girl was beautiful and young and
		innocent and she was the greatest
		piece of ass I've ever ad and I've
		had them all over the world.  Then
		Johnny comes along with that olive
		oil voice and guinea charm and she
		runs off.  She threw it all away to
		make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN
		MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE
		MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!

	EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

	An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott
	Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,
	INC." next to an open-faced fruit market.

	A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we
	cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters
	the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps
	before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very
	dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard,
	and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of
	the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,
	introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of
	handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful
	introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's
	glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
	They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are
	brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around
	in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,
	CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish
	with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no
	one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear
	that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

				SOLLOZZO
		My business is heroin, I have poppy
		fields, laboratories in Narseilles
		and Sicily, ready to go into
		production.  My importing methods
		are as safe as these things can be,
		about five per cent loss.  The risk
		is nothing, the profits enormous.

				DON CORLEONE
		Why do you come to me?  Why do I
		deserve your generosity?

				SOLLOZZO
		I need two million dollars in
		cash...more important, I need a
		friend who has people in high
		places; a friend who can guarantee
		that if one of my employees be
		arrested, they would get only light
		sentences.  Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		What percentages for my family?

				SOLLOZZO
		Thirty per cent.  In the first year
		your share would be four million
		dollars; then it would go up.

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is the percentage of the
		Tattaglia family?

	SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		My compliments.  I'll take care of
		them from my share.

				DON CORLEONE
		So.  I receive 30 per cent just for
		finance and legal protection.  No
		worries about operations, is that
		what you tell me?

				SOLLOZZO
		If you think two million dollars in
		cash is just finance, I congratulate
		you Don Corleone.

	There is a long silence; in which each person present feels
	the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		I said I would see you because I've
		heard you're a serious man, to be
		treated with respect...
			  (pause)
		But I'll say no to you.

	We feel this around the room.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll give you my reasons.  I have
		many, many friends in Politics.
		But they wouldn't be so friendly if
		my business was narcotics instead
		of gambling.  They think gambling
		is something like liquor, a harmless
		vice...and they think narcotics is
		dirty business.

	SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

				DON CORLEONE
		No...how a man makes his living is
		none of my business.  But this
		proposition of yours is too risky.
		All the people in my family lived
		well the last ten years, I won't
		risk that out of greed.

				SOLLOZZO
		Are you worried about security for
		your million?

				DON CORLEONE
		No.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Tattaglias will guarantee your
		investment also.

	This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

				SONNY
		The Tattaglia family guarantees our
		investment?

	SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face
	him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out
	of line.

				DON CORLEONE
		Young people are greedy, and they
		have no manners.  They speak when
		they should listen.  But I have a
		sentimental weakness for my
		children, and I've spoiled them, as
		you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my
		no is final.

	SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He
	glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do
	as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally
	takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

	The DON turns to SONNY.

				DON CORLEONE
		Santino, never let anyone outside
		the family know what you are
		thinking.  I think your brain is
		going soft from all that comedy you
		play with that young girl.

	TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display
	with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.

				DON CORLEONE
		What is this nonsense?

				HAGEN
		It's from Johnny.  It was announced
		this morning.  He's going to play
		the lead in the new Woltz Brothers
		film.

	INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,
	presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room
	from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see
	his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;
	mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something
	wet.

	He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
	He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is
	frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on
	his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of
	blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,
	moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face
	with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of
	his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy
	tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle
	of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and
	the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered
	with blood.

	WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.
	Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure
	terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and
	knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Send Johnny my congratulations.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)

	Fifth Avenue in the snow.  Christmas week.  People are
	bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.

	KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,
	carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.

				KAY
		We have something for your mother,
		for Sonny, we have the tie for
		Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the
		Reynolds pen...

				MICHAEL
		And what do you want for Christmas?

				KAY
		Just you.

	They kiss.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.  THE VIEW PANS
	AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony
		at the City Hall, no big fuss, no
		family, just a couple of friends as
		witnesses.

	The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on
	the two single beds that they have pushed together.

				KAY
		What will your father say?

				MICHAEL
		As long as I tell him beforehand he
		won't object.  He'll be hurt, but
		he won't object.

				KAY
		What time do they expect us?

				MICHAEL
		For dinner.  Unless I call and tell
		them we're still in New Hampshire.

				KAY
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		Then we can have dinner, see a
		show, and spend one more night.

	He moves to the telephone.

				MICHAEL (CONT'D.)
		Operator.  Get me
			  (fill in number)


				KAY
		Michael, what are you doing?

				MICHAEL
		Shhh, you be the long distance
		operator.  Here.

				KAY
		Hello...this is Long Distance.  I
		have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr.
		Michael Corleone.  One moment please.

	She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.

				MICHAEL
		Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah...
		listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm
		driving down to the city with Kay
		tomorrow morning.  There's something
		important I want to tell the old
		man before Christmas.  Will he be
		home tomorrow night?

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.  In the background,
	through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in
	his office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sure.  Anything I can do for you.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas.
		Everyone's going to be out at Long
		Beach, right?

				HAGEN
		Right.

	He smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of
	work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and
	hat, and continues out.

	He peeks into the DON's office.

				HAGEN
		Michael called; he's not leaving
		New Hampshire until tomorrow
		morning.  I've got to go, I promised
		Theresa I'd pick up some toys for
		the kids.

	The DON smiles and nods.

	TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.
	FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the
	afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office
	manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,
	raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the
	paper.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Paulie to get the car from the
		lot; I'll be ready to go home in a
		few minutes.

				FREDO
		I'll have to get it myself; Paulie
		called in sick this morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		That's the third time this month.
		I think maybe you'd better get a
		healthier bodyguard for me.  Tell
		Tom.

				FREDO
			  (going)
		Paulie's a good kid.  If he's sick,
		he's sick.  I don't mind getting
		the car.

	FREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out
	his window.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	FREDDIE crosses the street.

	INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

				OFFICE MANAGER
		Buon Watale, Don Corleone.

	The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.  Once again, the
	DON glances out his window.

	The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

				DON CORLEONE
		Merry Christmas.
			  (handing the MANAGER
			  an envelope)


	And he starts down the stairs.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.  When
	FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the
	driver's seat.  The DON moves to the car, and is about to
	get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open
	fruit stand near the corner.

	The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among
	the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular
	piece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the
	pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON
	pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then
	turns back to the car.

	EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

	TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift
	wrapped.  He continues past the windows.  As he walks,
	someone walks right in his way.  He looks up.  It is SOLLOZZO.

	He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (quietly)
		Don't be frightened.  I just want
		to talk to you.

	A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (urgently)
		Get in; I want to talk to you.

	HAGEN pulls his arm free.  He is frightened.

				HAGEN
		I haven't got time.

	TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.

				SOLLOZZO
		Get in the car.  If I wanted to
		kill you you'd be dead already.
		Trust me.

	HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving
	our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story
	of Hansel and Gretel.  We HEAR the car doors shut, and the
	car drive off.

	EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

	RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.  KAY and
	MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and
	she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.  KAY
	nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk
	arm in arm.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		a nun?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		Ingrid Bergman?

	They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees
	something that terrifies her.  She doesn't know what to do.
	MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

				KAY
			  (a little voice)
		Michael?

				MICHAEL
		I'm thinking about it.

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		No, I would not like you better if
		you were Ingrid Bergman.

	She cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm,
	back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave.

	The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
	DOWN."

	MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a
	dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY
	knows to remain silent.

				MICHAEL
			  (desperately)
		They don't say if he's dead or alive.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the
	car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON
	drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness
	toward the parked car.

				DON CORLEONE
		Fredo, Fredo!

	The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins
	rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

	Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,
	and continues toward the car.

	The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking
	over an entire case of fruit.

	The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

	Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are
	more GUNSHOTS.

	FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;
	having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun
	trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops
	the gun.

	The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

	The GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed
	DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;
	and pools of blood are beginning to form.

	The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;
	they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

	The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:
	rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely
	from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from
	windows.  But the street itself is now empty.

	FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great
	puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and
	face down in them.

	FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying
	something we cannot understand.  He begins to weep profusely.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night.  He
	gets off.

	He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.

	EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA walks down the late night street.  He approaches an
	elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still
	winking this late at night.  He waits and watches.  Then the
	sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.

	INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless
	glistening wooden floors.  Now, at this late time, the
	chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR
	is waxing them.  A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her
	receipts.  LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at
	the bar.  ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves
	behind the bar.

				MAN
		Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

				LUCA
		I know.

	LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

				SOLLOZZO
		Do you know who I am?

	LUCA Nods.

				SOLLOZZO
		You've been talking to the
		Tattaglias.  They thought we could
		do business.

	LUCA listens.

				SOLLOZZO
		I need somebody strong to protect
		my operation, physically.  I've
		heard you're not happy with your
		family, you might make a switch.

				LUCA
		If the money is good enough.

				SOLLOZZO
		On the first shipment, I can
		guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

	LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

	SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
	rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
	BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter
	magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.  Then,
	he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and
	puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

	INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing.  He approaches
	it, obviously fresh from a nap.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Do you recognize my voice?

				SONNY
		I think so.  Detective squad?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Right.  Don't say my name, just
		listen.  Somebody shot your father
		outside his place fifteen minutes
		ago.

				SONNY
		Is he alive?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I think so, but I can't get close
		enough.  There's a lot of blood.
		I'll try to find out more.

				SONNY
		Find out anything you can...you got
		a Grand coming.
			  (click)


	SONNY cradles the phone.  An incredible rage builds up in
	him, his face actually turning red.  He would like to rip
	the phone to pieces in his bare hands.  Then he controls it.
	Quickly, he dials another number.

				SONNY
		Theresa, let me talk to Tom.  Not
		yet?  Have him call me as soon as
		he gets home.

	He hangs up.

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, who is it?
			  (she enters the room)
		What is it?

				SONNY
			  (calmly)
		They shot the old man.

				SANDRA
		Oh God...

				SONNY
		Honey...don't worry.  Nothing else
		is going to happen.

	There is a POUNDING on the door.  A BABY starts crying.

				SANDRA
			  (really frightened)
		SONNY?

	SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and
	moves quickly.  He opens the front door quickly.  It is
	CLEMENZA.  He enters, SONNY closes the door.  SANDRA goes to
	look after the baby.

				CLEMENZA
			  (excited)
		You heard about your father?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		The word is out in the streets that
		he's dead.

				SONNY
		Where the hell was Paulie, why
		wasn't he with the Don?

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie's been a little sick all
		winter...he was home.

				SONNY
		How many times did he stay home the
		last couple of months?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe three, four times.  I always
		asked Freddie if he wanted another
		bodyguard, but he said no.  Things
		have been so smooth the last ten
		years...

				SONNY
		Go get Paulie, I don't care how
		sick he is.  Pick him up yourself,
		and bring him to my father's house.

				CLEMENZA
		That's all?  Don't you want me to
		send some people over here?

				SONNY
		No, just you and Paulie.

	CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the
	couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

				SONNY
		A couple of our people will come to
		stay here.  Do whatever they say;
		I'm going over to the main house.
		If you want me, use Pop's special
		phone.

	The telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it.

				SONNY
		Hello.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		Santino Corleone?

	SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY
	indicates that she be quiet.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		We have Tom Hagen.  In about three
		hours he'll be released with our
		proposition.  Don't do anything
		until you've heard what he has to
		say.  You can only cause a lot of
		trouble.  What's done is done.
			  (a pause)
		Don't lose that famous temper of
		yours.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		I'll wait.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.  It is night, but the
	courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the
	tops of all the houses.  It is very cold.  We see the figure
	of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.

	INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls
	out.

				SONNY
		Ma?  Ma, where are you.

	The kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes
	her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm.

				SONNY
		Ma, I just got a call.  Pop's
		hurt...I don't know how bad.

				MAMA
			  (quietly)
		Santino?  Have they killed him?

				SONNY
			  (almost in tears)
		We don't know yet, Ma.

				MAMA
		I'll get dressed.  In case we can
		see him...

	She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY
	turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He
	takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,
	and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his
	father's office.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	He switches the lights on in the DON's office.  The massive
	desk dominates the room.  SONNY moves quickly to the
	telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,
	and dials a number.

				SONNY
		Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.
		I want fifty reliable men out here.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		I heard, Sonny...but what about
		Clemenza's regime?

				SONNY
		I don't want to use Clemenza's
		people right now.  Understood?

	He hangs up.  He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the
	dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the
	desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.
	We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA
	BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer.

				SONNY
		Luca.

	INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

	The interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits
	and ties sit around in the booths.

	HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

				SOLLOZZO
		I know you're not in the muscle end
		of the family--so I don't want you
		to be afraid.  I want you to help
		the Corleones and I want you to
		help me.

	HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette
	in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye
	to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered
	china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully.

				SOLLOZZO
		Your boss is dead...

	HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.
	SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (pushing the bottle)
		Have some more.  We got him outside
		his office, just before I picked
		you up.  You have to make the peace
		between me and Santino.

	HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

				SOLLOZZO
		Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
		You know it's the smart thing to
		do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny
		into it.

				HAGEN
			  (pulling himself together)
		Sonny will come after you with
		everything he's got.

	SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

				SOLLOZZO
		That's going to be his first
		reaction.  You have to talk some
		sense into him.  The Tattaglia
		family stands behind me with all
		their people.  The other New York
		Families will go along with anything
		that prevents a full scale war.

	He leans close to HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Don was slipping; in the old
		days I could never have gotten to
		him.  Now he's dead, nothing can
		bring him back.  Talk to Sonny,
		talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza
		and Tessio...it's good business.

				HAGEN
		Even Sonny won't be able to call
		off Luca Brasi.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'll worry about Luca.  You take
		care of Sonny and the other two kids.

				HAGEN
		I'll try...It's what the Don would
		want us to do.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (lifting his hands in
			  an expression of harmlessness)
		Good...then you can go...
			  (he escorts him to
			  the door)
		I don't like violence.  I'm a
		businessman, and blood is a big
		expense.

	He opens the door; they step out together.

	EXT NITE: BUILDING

	HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

	But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.
	He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to
	SOLLOZZO in private.

	Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.  He opens the
	door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

				SOLLOZZO
		The old man is still alive.  Five
		bullets in his Sicilian hide and
		he's still alive.
			  (he gives a fatalistic
			  shrug)
		Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL driving during the night.  There is a little fog in
	the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making
	it difficult to see well.  The wipers move across the view,
	as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still
	decorated for Christmas.  The courtyard is bathed with white
	floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.  The
	narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link
	chain.  There are strange cars parked along the curving
	cement walk.  SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and
	chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

				MAN
		Who're you?

	ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and
	then turns.

				MAN 2
		It's the Don's kid; take the car,
		I'll bring him inside.

	The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

	INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

	The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL
	doesn't recognize.  They pay little attention to him.  Most
	of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas
	tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.

	THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a
	cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water
	glass half filled with whiskey.  On the other side of the
	sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is
	sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black
	with his saliva.  PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the
	other side of the room.  CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Your mother's at the hospital with
		the old man: He's gonna pull through.

	MICHAEL nods his relief.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

	He moves to THERESA.

				MICHAEL
			  (gently)
		You heard from Tom yet?

	Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and
	trembles.  Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the
	room; everyone speaks in a whisper.

				MICHAEL
			  (taking her hand)
		C'mon.

	He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad.  They look
	up, startled.

				SONNY
		Don't worry, Theresa; they just
		want to give Tom the proposition,
		then they're going to turn him loose.

	He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,
	he kisses him on the cheek.

				SONNY
		I was worried when we couldn't get
		in touch with you in that hick town.

				MICHAEL
		How's Mom?

				SONNY
		Good.  She's been through it before.
		Me too.  You were too young to know
		about it.  You better wait outside;
		there're some things you shouldn't
		hear.

				MICHAEL
		I can help you out...

				SONNY
		Oh no you can't, the old man'd be
		sore as hell if I let you get mixed
		up in this.

				MICHAEL
		Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

				SONNY
		Theresa.

	She understands, and leaves them alone.

				SONNY
		All right, Mikey...who do we have
		to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

				MICHAEL
		What?

				SONNY
		One of them fingered the old man.

	MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on
	trial for their lives.

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.

				SONNY
		You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.
		It was Paulie.

				MICHAEL
		How can you be sure?

				SONNY
		On the three days Paulie was sick
		this month, he got calls from a
		payphone across from the old man's
		building.  We got people in the
		phone company.
			  (he shrugs)
		Thank God it was Paulie...we'll
		need Clemenza bad.

	MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the
	situation.

				MICHAEL
		Is it going to be all-out war, like
		last time?

				SONNY
		Until the old man tells me different.

				MICHAEL
		Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't
		care what it costs.  I don't care
		if we have to fight all the five
		families in New York.  The Tattaglia
		family's going to eat dirt.  I
		don't care if we all go down
		together.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		That's not how Pop would have
		played it.

				SONNY
		I know I'm not the man he was.  But
		I'll tell you this and he'll tell
		you too.  When it comes to real
		action, I can operate as good as
		anybody short range.

				MICHAEL
			  (calmly)
		All right, Sonny.  All right.

				SONNY
		Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

				MICHAEL
		Is it like they say?  Is he that
		good?

	Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.
	Then open the door and rush out.

	Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped
	in a tight embrace with his WIFE.

				HAGEN
		If I plead before the Supreme
		Court, I'll never do better than I
		did tonight with that Turk.

	EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's
	study.  It stands out against the cold, dark night.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on
	the edge of the sofa.  The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,
	in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the
	morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many
	snacks.  They can barely talk anymore.

				HAGEN
		Is the hospital covered?

				SONNY
		The cops have it locked in and I
		got my people there visiting Pop
		all the time.  What about the hit
		list.

	HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

				HAGEN
		Too much, too far, too personal.
		The Don would consider this all
		purely a business dispute: Get rid
		of Sollozzo, and everything falls
		in line.  YOU don't have to go
		after the Tattaglias.

	CLEMENZA nods.

				HAGEN
		What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't
		seem worried about Luca.  That
		worries me.

				SONNY
		If Luca sold out we're in real
		trouble.

				HAGEN
		Has anyone been able to get in
		touch with him?

				SONNY
		No, and I've been calling all night.
		Maybe he's shacked up.

				HAGEN
		Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
		He always goes home when he's
		through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's
		number.

	MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the
	number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the
	other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up.

				HAGEN
		Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
			  (exhausted)


				SONNY
		Tom, you're the Consigliere, what
		do we do if the old man dies?

				HAGEN
		Without your father's political
		contacts and personal influence,
		the Corleone family loses half its
		strength.  Without your father, the
		other New York families might wind
		up supporting Sollozzo, and the
		Tattaglias just to make sure there
		isn't a long destructive war.  The
		old days are over, this is 1946;
		nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If
		your father dies...make the deal,
		Sonny.

				SONNY
			  (angry)
		That's easy to say; it's not your
		father.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I was as good a son to him as you
		or Mike.

				SONNY
		Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it
		that way.

				HAGEN
		We're all tired...

				SONNY
		OK, we sit tight until the old man
		can give us the lead.  But Tom, I
		want you to stay inside the Mall.
		You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio,
		you hold your people in reserve,
		but have them nosing around the
		city.  The hospital is yours; I
		want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours
		a day.

	There is a timid knock on the door.

				SONNY
		What is it?

	PAULIE GATTO looks in.

				CLEMENZA
		I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...

				PAULIE
		The guy at the gate's outside...says
		there's a package...

				SONNY
		Tessio, see what it is.

	TESSIO gets up, leaves.

				PAULIE
		You want me to hang around?

				SONNY
		Yeah.  Hang around.

				PAULIE
		Outside?

				CLEMENZA
		Outside.

				PAULIE
		Sure.

	He closes the door.

				SONNY
		Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie.
		I don't ever want to see him again.
		Understood?

				CLEMENZA
		Understood.

				SONNY
		Okay, now you can move your men
		into the Mall, replace Tessio's
		people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a
		couple of Clemenza's people and go
		to Luca's apartment and wait for
		him to show.  That crazy bastard
		might be going after Sollozzo right
		now if he's heard the news.

				HAGEN
		Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up
		in this so directly.  You know the
		old man doesn't want that.

				SONNY
		OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

	MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca
	Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one
	answers.

	TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest
	in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped
	inside.

				CLEMENZA
		A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi
		sleeps with the fishes.

	INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we
	remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.
	LUCA looks up at him.

	Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
	LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both
	clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is
	thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His
	face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally
	purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a
	far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes
	bulge.

	ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's
	strength leaves him.

				BRUNO
			  (making an ugly face)
		Oh Christ...all over the floor.

	SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his
	face.

	LUCA falls to the floor.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Godfather is next.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.  There are rows of
	pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A
	dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a
	noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This
	is ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,
	talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the
	side of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is
	specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work
	washing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.

				LAMPONE
		Nice.

				CLEMENZA
		Crazy Detroit delivered it with a
		wooden bumper.  They're going to
		send me the chrome bumpers in a
		couple months.  I waited two years
		for this car to come with wooden
		bumpers!

	He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

				CLEMENZA
		Today you make your bones on Paulie.
		You understand everything?

				LAMPONE
		Sure.

	As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,
	unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

				CLEMENZA
		.22 soft-nosed load.  Accurate up
		to five feet.

	LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.  GATTO's car pulls into
	the driveway, and he sounds the horn.

	The two men walk to the car.  GATTO is driving, a bit
	nervous, like he doesn't know what is up.  LAMPONE gets in
	the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of
	recognition.  He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting
	to chide PAULIE for being late.  PAULIE flinches a little
	when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

				PAULIE
		Rocco, sit on the other side.  A
		big guy like you blocks my rearview
		mirror.

	CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Goddamn Sonny.  He's running scared.
		He's already thinking of going to
		the mattresses.  We have to find a
		place on the West Side.  Paulie,
		you know a good location?

	PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook
	he was on.  Also there's the money he can make by selling
	Sollozzo any secret location.

				PAULIE
		I'll think about it.

				CLEMENZA
			  (grunting)
		Drive while you thinking; I wanna
		get to the City this month!

	The car pulls out.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

	Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump.  OUR
	VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter
	light.

	INT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.
	He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Pay attention!

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	The car is parked in the City.  PAULIE comes down from an
	available apartment and gets back into the car.

				PAULIE
		Good for ten men...

				CLEMENZA
		OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm
		suppose to call when I found
		somethin'.

	The car pulls off.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
	CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		You wait; I'll call.

	He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the
	corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

	INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
	The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some
	bread--and then a plate of veal on his table.  He eats.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;
	he is well fed.

	We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to
	expect has happened to Paulie.

	There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,
	LAMPONE in the rear seat.  CLEMENZA steps in.

				CLEMENZA
		He talked my ear off.  Want us to
		go back to Long Beach; have another
		job for us.  Rocco, you live in the
		City, can we drop you off?

				LAMPONE (O.S.)
		Ah, I left my car at your place.

				CLEMENZA
		OK, then you gotta come back.

	The car pulls out.  By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and
	secure.

				PAULIE
		You think we'll go for that last
		place?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe, or you gotta know now.

				PAULIE
		Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

	The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
	Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie, pull over.  I gotta take a
		leak.

	The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA
	steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

	He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer
	see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting
	the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there
	are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and
	turns, moving back to the car.

	PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind
	him are shattered.

				CLEMENZA
		Leave the gun.

	LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few
	feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange
	cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group
	of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries
	with concealed weapons.

	MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

	He is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the
	strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They
	look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the
	respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He
	wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

	A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground
	equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This
	is where he was a child.  Then a shout.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Mike.  Hey Mikey; telephone.

	CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL
	hurries into the house.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.
	He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the
	hook.

				CLEMENZA
		Some dame.

	MICHAEL picks it up.

				MICHAEL
		Hello.  Kay?

				KAY (O.S.)
		How is your father?

				MICHAEL
		He'll be OK.

				KAY (O.S.)
			  (pause)
		I love you.

	He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the
	phone.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I LOVE YOU.

				MICHAEL
		Yeah Kay, I'm here.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Can you say it?

				MICHAEL
		Huh?

				KAY (O.S.)
		Tell me you love me.

	MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls
	up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:

				MICHAEL
		I can't...

				KAY (O.S.)
		Please say it.

				MICHAEL
		Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

				KAY (O.S.)
		OK.
			  (click)


	CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all
	the button men stationed around the house.

				CLEMENZA
		How come you don't tell that nice
		girl you love her...here, learn
		something... you may have to feed
		fifty guys some day.  You start
		with olive oil...fry some garlic,
		see.  And then fry some sausage...or meat
		balls if you like...then you throw
		in the tomatoes, the tomato
		paste...some basil; and a little
		red wine...that's my trick.

	SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

				SONNY
		You take care of Paulie?

				CLEMENZA
		You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's
		sick for good this winter.

	MICHAEL starts to leave.

				SONNY
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		To the city.

				SONNY
			  (to Clemenza; dipping
			  bread into the sauce)
		Send some bodyguards.

				MICHAEL
		I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just
		going to see Pop in the hospital.
		Also, I got other things.

				CLEMENZA
		Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

				SONNY
		OK, but be careful.

	EXT NITE: CAR

	MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven
	into the city.  THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front
	seat.

	INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

	MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying
	to book rooms.

	INT NITE: HOTEL

	MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel.  He is
	preoccupied, she's concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
		I'll just sit with him; I want to
		show respect.

				KAY
		Can I go to the hospital with you?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  You don't want
		to end up on page 3 of the Daily
		News.

				KAY
		My parents don't read the Daily
		News.  All right, if you think I
		shouldn't.  I can't believe the
		things the papers are printing.
		I'm sure most of it's not true.

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so either.
			  (silence)
		I better go.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to go back to New
		Hampshire...think things over.

	He leans over her; kisses her.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		Goodbye.

	Quietly, he moves out the door.

	KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:

				KAY
		Goodbye.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with
	a neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."  MICHAEL steps out, pays
	the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

	MICHAEL looks.

	He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.  He
	is the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling
	Christmas decorations all over the building.  He walks,
	slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He
	hesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the
	address on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.  He tries the
	door, it is empty.

	He walks in.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital
	lobby.  He looks to the right; there is a long, empty
	corridor.  To the left: the same.

	HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated
	building lit by eerie green neon lighting.  All we hear are
	his sole footsteps.

	He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".  No one is there.
	He moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it;
	no one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a
	sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

				MICHAEL
		Hello?  Hello?

	Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,
	alertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all
	alone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS

	Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several
	flights.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

	He steps out onto the fourth floor.  He looks.  There are
	merely empty corridors.  He takes out his scrap of paper;
	checks it.  "Room 4A."  Now he hurries, trying to follow the
	code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker
	and quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up "4A--
	Corleone".

	There is a special card table set up there with some
	magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the
	ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

	INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A

	Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he
	will find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the
	window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the
	room, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be
	heard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly
	MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,
	securely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the
	bed, and run to his nose and mouth.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a
	NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.

				NURSE
		You're not supposed to be here now.

	MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

				MICHAEL
		I'm Michael Corleone--this is my
		father.  What happened to the
		detectives who were guarding him?

				NURSE
		Oh your father just had too many
		visitors.  It interfered with the
		hospital service.  The police came
		and made them all leave just ten
		minutes ago.
			  (comfortingly)
		But don't worry.  I look in on him.

				MICHAEL
		You just stand here one minute...

	Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.

				MICHAEL
		Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm
		down at the hospital.  I came down
		late.  There's no one here.  None
		of Tessio's people--no detectives,
		no one.  The old man is completely
		unprotected.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		All right, get him in a different
		room; lock the door from the inside.
		I'll have some men there inside of
		fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and
		don't panic.

				MICHAEL
			  (furiously, but kept inside)
		I won't panic.

	He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...

				NURSE
		You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You and I are going to move my
		father right now...to another room
		on another floor...Can you
		disconnect those tubes so we can
		wheel the bed out?

				NURSE
		Absolutely not!  We have to get
		permission from the Doctor.

				MICHAEL
		You've read about my father in the
		papers.  You've seen that no one's
		here to guard him.  Now I've just
		gotten word that men are coming to
		this hospital to kill him.  Believe
		me and help me.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		We don't have to disconnect them,
		we can wheel the stand with the bed.

	She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of
	moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently
	down the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
	MICHAEL hears them, stops.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry, into there.

	They push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks
	out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they
	emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet
	of flowers.

				MICHAEL
			  (stepping out)
		Who is it?

				ENZO
		Michael...do you remember me, Enzo,
		the baker's helper to Nazorine, now
		his son-in-law.

				MICHAEL
		Enzo, get out of here.  There's
		going to be trouble.

	A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

				ENZO
		If there...will be trouble...I stay
		with you, to help.  I owe it to the
		Godfather.

	MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.

				MICHAEL
		Go outside; stand in front...I'll
		be out in a minute.

	INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	They part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they
	put his FATHER.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		He's awake.

	MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he
	cannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

				MICHAEL
		Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh,
		don't try to speak.  There are men
		who are coming to try to kill you.
		But I'm with you...I'm with you
		now...

	The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly
	puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

	Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,
	pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only
	weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They
	both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
	They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,
	lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of those and look like
		you've got a gun in your pocket.

	The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas
	decorations.

				MICHAEL
		Listen...

	We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL
	and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes
	the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
	They stand, hands in their pockets.

	A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
	MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car
	seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
	MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the
	BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they
	are not.

	Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of
	police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital,
	getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

	In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of
	the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed
	POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts
	toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his
	arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,
	spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,
	with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is
	McCLUSKEY.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I thought I got all you guinea
		hoods locked up.  Who the hell are
		you and what are you doing here?

	ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

				COP
		He's clean, Captain.

	MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		What happened to the detectives who
		were supposed to be guarding my
		father?

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		You punk-hood.  Who the hell are
		you to tell me my business.  I
		pulled them off.  I don't care how
		many Dago gangsters kill each other.
		I wouldn't lift a finger to keep
		your old man from getting knocked
		off.  Now get the hell out of here;
		get off this street you punk, and
		stay away from this hospital.

	MICHAEL stands quiet.

				MICHAEL
		I'll stay until you put guards
		around my father's room.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Phil, lock this punk up.

				A DETECTIVE
		The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a
		war hero, and he's never been mixed
		up in the rackets...

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		Goddam it, I said lock him up.  Put
		the cuffs on him.

				MICHAEL
			  (deliberately, right
			  to McCLUSKEY's face,
			  as he's being handcuffed)
		How much is the Turk paying you to
		set my father up, Captain?

	Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL
	squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
	MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at
	McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and
	he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S
	MEN arrive.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a
	long black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN
	stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
	rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
	standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is
	escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,
	MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He
	stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN
	holding rifles.

				MICHAEL
		Christ, Sonny really means business.

	They continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various
	BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

				CLEMENZA
		How come all the new men?

				TESSIO
		We'll need them now.  After the
		hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
		We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock
		this morning.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

	They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

				SONNY
		I've got a hundred button men on
		the streets twenty-four hours a day.
		If Sollozzo shows one hair on his
		ass he's dead.

	He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,
	kiddingly.

				SONNY
		Mikey, you look beautiful!

				MICHAEL
		Cut it out.

				SONNY
		The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve
		of that son of a bitch!  After he
		craps out last night he wants a meet.

				HAGEN
		Was there a definite proposal?

				SONNY
		Sure, he wants us to send Mike to
		meet him to hear his proposition.
		The promise is the deal will be so
		good we can't refuse.

				HAGEN
		What about that Tattaglias?  What
		will they do about Bruno?

				SONNY
		Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out
		what they did to my father.

				HAGEN
		We should hear what they have to say.

				SONNY
		No, no Consiglere.  Not this time.
		No more meetings, no more
		discussions, no more Sollozzo
		tricks.  Give them one message: I
		WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all
		out war.  We go to the mattresses
		and we put all the button men out
		on the street.

				HAGEN
		The other families won't sit still
		for all out war.

				SONNY
		Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

				HAGEN
		Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't
		want to hear this.  This is not a
		personal thing, this is Business.

				SONNY
		And when they shot me father...

				HAGEN
		Yes, even the shooting of your
		father was business, not personal...

				SONNY
		No no, no more advice on how to
		patch it up Tom.  You just help me
		win.  Understood?

	HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

				HAGEN
		I found out about this Captain
		McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
		He's definitely on Sollozzo's
		payroll, and for big money.
		McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
		bodyguard.  What you have to
		understand is that while Sollozzo
		is guarded like this, he's
		invulnerable.  Nobody has ever
		gunned down a New York Police
		Captain.  Never.  It would be
		disastrous.  All the five families
		would come after you Sonny; the
		Corleone family would be outcasts;
		even the old man's political
		protection would run for cover.  So
		just...take that into consideration.

				SONNY
			  (still fuming)
		McCluskey can't stay with the Turk
		forever.  We'll wait.

				MICHAEL
		We can't wait.  No matter what
		Sollozzo say about a deal, he's
		figuring out how to kill Pop.  You
		have to get Sollozzo now.

				SONNY
		The kid's right.

				HAGEN
		What about McCluskey?

				MICHAEL
		Let's say now that we have to kill
		McCluskey.  We'll clear that up
		through our Newspaper contacts later.

				SONNY
		Go on Mike.

				MICHAEL
		They want me to go to the conference
		with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting
		for two days from now.  Sonny, get
		our informers to find out where the
		meeting will be held.
		Insist it has to be a public place:
		a bar or restaurant at the height
		of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel
		safe.  They'll check me when I meet
		them so I won't be able to carry a
		weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
		way to have one planted there for
		me.
			  (pause)
		Then I'll kill them both.

	Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
	Silence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points
	a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

				SONNY
		You?  You, the high-class college
		kid.  You never wanted to get mixed
		up in the family business.  Now you
		wanta gun down a police Captain and
		the Turk just because you got
		slapped in the face.  You're taking
		it personal, it's just business and
		he's taking it personal.

	Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps
	his face serious.

				MICHAEL
			  (angrily, but cold)
		Sonny, it's all personal, and I
		learned it from him, the old man,
		the Godfather.  He took my joining
		the Marines personal.  I take
		Sollozzo trying to kill my father
		personal, and you know I'll kill
		them Sonny.

	MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

	INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE on a revolver.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		It's as cold as they come,
		impossible to trace.
			  (he turns it upside down)
		Don't worry about prints Mike, I
		put a special tape on the trigger
		and butt.  Here.
			  (he hands the gun to
			  another pair of hands)
		Whatsamatter?  Trigger too tight.
			  (it fires: very LOUD)
		I left it noisy, so it'll scare any
		pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander
		away.

	MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

				CLEMENZA
		Just let your hand drop to your
		side, and let the gun slip out.
		Everybody will still think you got
		it.  They'll be starin' at your
		face, see?  Then walk out of the
		place real fast, but don't run.
		Don't look anybody directly in the
		eye, but don't look away from them
		neither.  Hey, they'll be scared
		stiff o you, believe me.  Nobody's
		gonna bother with you.  Don't worry
		about nothing; you'd be surprised
		how good these things go.  O.K.,
		put your hat on, let's see how you
		look.  Helps with identification.

	They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

				CLEMENZA
		Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse
		to change their identification when
		we make them see the light.  Then
		you take a long vacation and we
		catch the hell.

				MICHAEL
		How bad will it be?

				CLEMENZA
		Probably all the other families
		will line up against us.  But, it's
		alright.  These things have to
		happen once every ten years or
		so...gets rid of the bad blood.
		You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.
		Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at
		Munich, they shoulda never let him
		get away with that, they were just
		asking for big trouble...

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.  A card
	table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the
	Corleone buttonmen.

	He continues into the living room.  It's a mess.  SONNY
	asleep on the sofa.  On the coffee table are the remains of
	a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of
	whisky.  The radio is playing.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you stop living like a
		bum and get this place cleaned up.

				SONNY
		What are you, inspecting the
		barracks?
			  (SONNY sits up with
			  his head in his hands)
		You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you
		be sure to drop the gun right away?

				MICHAEL
		A million times.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to
		pick you up in an hour and a half
		on Times Square, under the big
		Camels sign.

				HAGEN
		We don't let Mike go until we have
		the hostage, Sonny.

				CLEMENZA
		It's okay...the hostage is outside
		playing pinochle with three of my
		men.

	The phone rings in the DON's office.

				SONNY
		That could be a Tattaglia informer
		with the meeting place.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS
	move in.

	HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

				SONNY
		One of Tattaglia's people?

				HAGEN
		No.  Our informer in McCluskey's
		precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he
		signed out for Louis' Restaurant in
		the Bronx.  Anyone know it.

				TESSIO
		Sure, I do.  It's perfect for us.
		A small family place with big
		booths where people can talk in
		private.  Good food.  Everybody
		minds their business.  Perfect.
			  (he moves to the desk
			  and makes a crude drawing)
		This is the entrance, Mike.  When
		you finish just walk out and turn
		left, then turn the corner.
		Clemenza, you gotta work fast to
		plant the gun.  They got an old-
		fashioned toilet with a space
		between the water container and the
		wall.  We can tape the gun behind
		there.

				CLEMENZA
		Mike, they're gonna frisk you in
		the car.  You'll be clean so they
		won't worry 'bout nothing.  In the
		restaurant, wait and talk a while,
		and then ask permission to go.  See?
		Then when you come out, don't waste
		time; don't sit down...you come out
		blasting.  And don't take chances.
		In the head, two shots apiece.  And
		out as fast as your legs can move.

				SONNY
		I want somebody very good, very
		safe to plant that gun.  I don't
		want my brother coming out of that
		toilet with just his dick in his
		hand.

				CLEMENZA
		The gun will be there.

				SONNY
			  (to MICHAEL, warmly)
		You're on, kid...I'll square it
		with Mom your not seeing her before
		you left.  And I'll get a message
		to your girl friend when I think
		the time is right.

				CLEMENZA
		We gotta move...

				MICHAEL
		O.K.  How long do you think before
		I can come back?

				SONNY
		Probably a year...

				HAGEN
			  (starting to crack)
		Jesus, I don't know...

				SONNY
		Can you do it Mike?

	MICHAEL moves out.

	EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

	The enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands
	MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat
	CLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the
	corner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open
	the front door.

				DRIVER
		Get in, Mike.

	He does, the car drives off.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat
	and shakes MIKE's hand.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we
		can straighten everything out.  All
		this is terrible, it's not the way
		I wanted things to happen at all.
		It should never have happened.

				MICHAEL
		I want to settle things tonight.  I
		want my father left alone.

				SOLLOZZO
		He won't be; I swear to you be my
		children he won't be.  Just keep an
		open mind when we talk.  I hope
		you're not a hothead like your
		brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to
		talk business with him.

	McCLUSKEY grunts.

				MCCLUSKEY
		He's a good kid.  He's all right.
		Turn around, up on your knees,
		facing me.

	He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I'm sorry about the other night
		Mike.  I'm getting too old for my
		job, too grouchy.  Can't stand the
		aggravation.  You know how it is.
		He's clean.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where
	they're heading.

	The car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		We're going to New Jersey?

				SOLLOZZO
			  (sly)
		Maybe.

	MICHAEL closes his eyes.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

	The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way
	to New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider,
	temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the
	lanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on
	the way back to the city.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and
	then leans to the DRIVER.

				SOLLOZZO
		Nice work; I'll remember it.

	MICHAEL is relieved.

	EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in
	the Bronx:  The "LUNA AZURA".  There is no one on the street.
	MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with
	them.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY
	and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the
	car.  They enter the restaurant.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
	SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small
	round table near the center of the room.  There are empty
	booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,
	and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Is the Italian food good here?

				SOLLOZZO
		Try the veal; it's the finest in
		New York.

	The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
	They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three
	glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

				SOLLOZZO
		I am going to talk Italian to Mike.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll
		concentrate on my veal and my
		spaghetti.

	SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening
	carefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers
	in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally
	brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
	Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in
	Italian, accidentally lapses into English.

				MICHAEL
			  (using English for emphasis)
		Most important...I want a sure
		guarantee that no more attempts
		will be made on my father's life.

				SOLLOZZO
		What guarantees can I give you?  I
		am the hunted one.  I've missed my
		chance.  You think too highly of
		me, my friend...I am not so
		clever...all I want if a truce...

	MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling
	holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up
	my sleeve".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look
	on his face.

				SOLLOZZO
		What is it?

				MICHAEL
		Is it all right if I go to the
		bathroom?

	SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with
	his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's
	thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I frisked him; I've frisked
		thousands of young punks; he's clean.

	He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;
	indicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,
	indicating no one is there.

				SOLLOZZO
		Don't take too long.

	MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and
	disappears inside.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very
	hard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his
	hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
	Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
	Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he
	cannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is
	just a few inches from the gun...he gropes
	searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

	CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he
	breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep
	breath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some
	unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately
	washes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
	McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO
	turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at
	MICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues
	back to the table.  He sits down.

				MICHAEL
		Now I can talk.  I feel much better.

	The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now
	he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down
	comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton
	his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again
	but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear
	him.

	The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to
	speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away
	from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts
	the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his
	temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's
	head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the
	entire area.

	The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is
	sprayed and stained with blood.

	SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he
	seems to hang in space suspended.

	MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

	There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal
	suspended in air before his gaping mouth.

	MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging
	throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then
	coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right
	through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

	The air is filled with pink mist.
	MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
	He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
	Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
	The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an
	expression of horror on his face.
	MICHAEL looks at his two victims:
	SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by
	the table.
	McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
	MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His
	hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
	He moves, not letting the gun go.

	MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

	His hand: still holding the gun.

	His face: finally he closes his eyes.

	His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

	He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

	He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had
	been recreated in wax.

	Then he leaves.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old
	upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.
	ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

	A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,
	quietly eating.  They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there
	is an occasional laugh.

	ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered
	with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

	A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

	The sentimental tune is continued over the following:

	INT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie
	still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.

	INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS

	Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty
	living room of an apartment.  THREE or FOUR MEN including
	CLEMENZA, are taking naps.

	An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.

	The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and
	pouring the wine.

	Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.

	INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an
	office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.
	Truman.

	EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)

	ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning
	three steps of a front stoop.

	INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a
	crossword puzzle.

	A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.

	Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.
	Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

	A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of
	Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.

	EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)

	A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet
	alley.

	INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in
	a pool of blood on the tablecloth.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an
	apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family
	War..."

	The table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE
	has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.

	SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.

	The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up
	and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods
	appreciatively.

				MAN
		Nice Augie...nice.

	EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)

	Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York
	apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's
	bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards
	against the curb.

	Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of
	brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

	Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,
	smoking a cigarette.

	One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,
	which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a
	door opening; they look up.

	The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

	SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI
	wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she
	draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he
	comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

	He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard
	on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The
	men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car:

				DRIVER
		Pick up your sister?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

	The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the
	bodyguards in their cars.

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

	He knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again.

				CONNIE'S VOICE
		Who is it?

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY
	enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her
	back to him.

				SONNY
			  (tenderly)
		Connie, what is it?

	He turns her around in his arms.

	Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her
	rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
	As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red
	with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing
	him from running out of the apartment.

				CONNIE
			  (desperately)
		It was my fault!  I started a fight
		with him and I tried to hit him so
		he hit me.  He didn't even try to
		hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

	Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder,
	the thin silk robe.

				SONNY
		I'm goin' to have the doctor come
		over and take a look at you.

	He starts to leave.

				CONNIE
		Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
		Please don't.

	He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

				SONNY
		Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do?
		Make your kid a orphan before he's
		born.

	She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

	EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

	CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
	"Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking
	beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the
	corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the
	kids on the street are still playing stickball.

	CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street
	suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block
	and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires
	scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a
	MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast
	the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we
	recognize that it is SONNY.

	His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on
	the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

	He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down
	into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,
	and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to
	hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
	His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

	SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

	SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,
	in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His
	blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

	The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching
	in fascination.

	CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

	SONNY beats him mercilessly.

	Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become
	spectators.

	SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into
	CARLO's face and body.

	CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does
	nothing, other than hang onto the railing.

	SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag
	him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in
	the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;
	even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.

	It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will
	not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him
	more; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he
	stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

				SONNY
		You...bastard...You...hurt my
		sister... again...and I'll
		kill...you.

	He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
	and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,
	leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN
	with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially
	interested.

	CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps
	onto the stoop.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day.
	Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of
	various points around the main house and compound.  Things
	have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new
	and secure gate house has been built.  Security measures
	that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made
	a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval
	Fortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the
	result of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the
	crater is damaged by fire.

	A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright
	yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the
	shelter of the gate house.

	They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they
	call the main house.

	KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still
	runs down onto her face.

	She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the
	sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

	TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

				HAGEN
		Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You
		should call...

				KAY
		I've tried calling and writing.  I
		want to reach Michael.

				HAGEN
		Nobody knows where he is.  We know
		he's all right, but that's all.

	KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with
	rainwater.

				KAY
		What was that?

				HAGEN
		An accident.  No one was hurt.

				KAY
		Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I
		come in to call another one?

	TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has
	to.

				HAGEN
		Sure...I'm sorry.

	They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and
	takes her rainhat off.

				KAY
		Will you give this to him.

				HAGEN
		If I accept that letter and you
		told a Court of Law I accepted it,
		they would interpret it as my
		having knowledge of his whereabouts.
		Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.

	We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE
	enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

				MAMA
		You're Mikey's little girl.

	KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

				MAMA
		You eat anything?

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
			  (to HAGEN)
		Disgrazia, you don't even give the
		poor girl a cup of coffee?

	HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves
	toward MAMA, the letter extended.

				KAY
		Will you give this letter to Michael.

				HAGEN
		Mama, no.

				MAMA
		You tell me what to do?  Even he
		don't tell me what to do.

	She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

				KAY
		Why did they blame Michael?

				MAMA
		You listen to me, you go home to
		your family, and you find a good
		young man and get married.  Forget
		about Mikey; he's no good for you,
		anymore.

	She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what
	that means.

	EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)

	A hospital in New York City.  POLICE and teams of PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.  An ambulance
	with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the
	hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL
	ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying
	the DON.

	TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing
	up the rear.  HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a
	moment they disappear behind the ambulance.  Then suddenly,
	siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung
	cars.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	The Corleone Mall.

	Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone
	Mall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES.

	It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
	All is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday
	clothes, wait.

	EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)

	One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,
	preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a
	team of BUTTON MEN.

	Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with
	a rifle on his lap.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)

	Inside the Main CORLEONE House:

	Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully
	under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and
	various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.

	All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,
	THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but
	been converted into a hospital room, with complete and
	extensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to
	kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then
	SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO
	should leave.

	They do, the door is closed.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the
	Sunday dinner, and set the table.

	CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

				CONNIE
		What's the matter, Carlo?

				CARLO
		Shut up.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with
	grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON
	does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and
	glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is
	the spokesman for the family.

				HAGEN
		...since McCluskey's killing, the
		police have cracked down on most of
		our operations...on the other
		families too.  There's been a lot
		of bad blood.

	The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.

				SONNY
		Pop, they hit us and we hit them
		back.

				HAGEN
		We put out a lot of material
		through our contacts in the
		Newspapers...about McCluskey's
		being tied up with Sollozzo in the
		Drug Rackets...things are starting
		to loosen up.

	The OLD MAN nods.

				SONNY
		Freddie's gonna go to Las
		Vegas...under the protection of Don
		Francesco of L.A.  I want him to
		rest...

				FREDO
		I'm goin' to learn the casino
		business.

	The DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room
	for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

				HAGEN
		Michael...
			  (he takes a breath)
		It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

	The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and
	rage.

				HAGEN
		He's safe now...we're already
		working on ways to bring him back.

	The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they
	leave him alone.

	INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is
	expansive and optimistic.

				SONNY
		We'll let the old man take it easy
		for a couple of weeks.  I want to
		get things going good before he
		gets better.  What's the matter
		with you?

				HAGEN
		You start operating, the five
		families will start their raids
		again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny,
		your war is costing us a lot of
		money.

				SONNY
		No more stalemate Tom, we got the
		soldiers, we'll match them gun for
		gun if that's how they want it.
		They know me for what I am, Tom--
		and they're scared of me.

				HAGEN
		Yes.  That's true, you're getting a
		hell of a reputation.

				SONNY
		Well it's war!  We might not be in
		this shape if we had a real war-
		time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop
		had Genco, who do I have?
			  (TOM starts to leave)
		Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday,
		we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be
		sore.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table
	over Sunday dinner.  SONNY is at the head of the table.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed
	Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally
	by the gate.

	ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.  A
	young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

	-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

	CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone.
	We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.

				CONNIE
		Who is this?

				GIRL (O.S.)
			  (giggle)
		I'm a friend of Carlo's.  I just
		wanted to tell him I can't see him
		tonight; I have to go out of town.

	CONNIE's face turns red.

				CONNIE
		You lousy tramp bitch.
			  (click)


	She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the
	bathroom drying his golden body.

				CARLO
		What was that?

				CONNIE
		Your girl friend.  She says she
		can't make it tonight.  You lousy
		bastard you have the nerve to give
		your whores my telephone number.
		I'll kill you, you bastard!

	She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then
	she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy
	belly heaving under the thin slip.

				CARLO
			  (defending himself)
		You're crazy.  She was kidding
		around; I don't know, some nut.

	He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue
	dressing.

				CONNIE
		You're staying home.  You're not
		going out.

				CARLO
		OK, OK.  You gonna make me something
		to eat at least?

	That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing
	heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and
	starts her wifely duties.

	CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in
	the doorway.

				CONNIE
		The food is on the table.

				CARLO
		I'm not hungry yet.

				CONNIE
		Eat it, it's on the table.

				CARLO
		Ba Fa Goulle.

				CONNIE
		BA FA GOULE YOU!

	She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.  A moment
	later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.  CARLO
	slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically
	smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy
	veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

				CARLO
		You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
		Clean it up or I'll kick your head
		in.

				CONNIE
		Like hell I will.

	She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again.  Slowly,
	he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in
	his hand.

				CARLO
		Clean it up!

	He swings the belt against her heavy hips.  She moves back
	into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it
	ready.

				CARLO
		Even the female Corleones are
		murderers.

	He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.  She
	makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.  He
	pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.  She
	gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,
	gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

	She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

				CONNIE
		The baby!  The baby!

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM  (SPRING 1946)

	She runs into the bedroom; he follows.  She moves into a
	corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide
	under the bed.

	He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

	He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he
	throws her on the bed, contemptuously.  He grabs part of her
	thigh, pinching it very hard.

				CARLO
		You're fat as a pig.

	Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving
	her in tears.  She is crying; she pulls herself to the
	bedroom phone, and in a whisper:

				CONNIE
		Mama...mama, it's Connie.  Mama, I
		can't talk any louder.  No, I don't
		want to talk to Sonny.

	We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

	In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the
	whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.

				SONNY
		Yeah Connie.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Sonny, just send a car to bring me
		home.  I'll tell you then, it's
		nothing Sonny, don't you come.
		Send TOM, please Sonny, it's
		nothing; I just want to come home.

	SONNY's face is turning red.

				SONNY
			  (in a controlled voice)
		You wait there.  You just wait there.

	He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

	HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he
	cannot interfere.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	SONNY leaves the house.  HAGEN moves to the outside mall
	just as SONNY's car is driving off.  He moves to a group of
	BUTTON MEN.

				HAGEN
		Go after him.

	EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.
	After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is
	trailing.

	SONNY is driving; he is very angry.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY in his car; driving back.  Still breathing hard and
	still furious.  Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.
	He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a
	toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the
	COLLECTOR.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

	The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		This is Tom Hagen.  I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

	BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.
	BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.

				BONASERA
		Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		You owe the Don a service.  In one
		hour, not before, perhaps later, he
		will be at your funeral parlor to
		ask for your help.  Be there to
		greet him.  If you have any
		objections speak now, and I'll
		inform him.

	Silence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.

				BONASERA
		Anything...Anything the Godfather
		wishes.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Good.  He never doubted you.

				BONASERA
		The Don himself is coming to me
		tonight?

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Yes.
			  (click)


	BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE
	sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

	Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows
	something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes
	from him.  He lights a cigarette.

				BONASERA
		For the last year, they have been
		killing one another.  So now, what?
		Your Godfather comes to me...Why?
			  (whispering, slyly)
		They've killed someone so important
		that they wish to make his body
		disappear.

				MRS. BONASERA
			  (frightened)
		Amerigo!

				BONASERA
		They could make me an accomplice to
		their murder.  They could send me
		to jail!

	He slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to
	tie his tie, as she has done for years.

				BONASERA
		And if the other families find
		out...they will make me their enemy.
		They could come here to our house.
		I curse the day I ever went to the
		Godfather.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without
	turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,
	past the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that
	lifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into
	the alley.

	He sits on a bench, and waits.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

	The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;
	we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral
	parlor.

	CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
	BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO
	OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a
	CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet
	protruding.

	BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way
	the MEN should carry their sinister burden.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming
	room.

	Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the
	darkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE.

	He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His
	cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
	Then, after a long gaze:

				DON CORLEONE
		Well my friend, are you ready to do
		me this service?

	BONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming
	table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

				BONASERA
		What do you wish me to do?

				DON CORLEONE
			  (staring at the table)
		I want you to use all your powers,
		all your skill, as you love me.  I
		do not want his mother to see him
		as he is.

	He draws down the gray blanket.

	BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:

	The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.

	A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the
	booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets
	him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll
	booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the
	car blocking him.

	The windows of his car are shot out.

	Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

	His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.

	His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it
	continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that
	he will survive it.

	Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and
	actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER
	fire.

	His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.

	A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and
	make off in the distance.

	SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they
	are too late.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room.  He is silent
	a moment, and then:

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		OK.  Go to Clemenza's house and
		tell him to come here right away.
		He'll tell you what to do.

	The MEN leave him alone.  He is quiet, standing in the
	middle of the living room a moment.  He looks in the
	direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA
	moving around.

	INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

	TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the
	DON's room.  He opens the DON's door.  Looks in.

	INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON in his hospital bed.  Asleep under sedation.  HAGEN
	hesitates.  He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN.  He
	closes the door.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN alone in the office.  He is drinking.  He looks up at
	the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.  Then he
	hears footsteps.

	The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE
	slowly enters the room.  He walks directly to his stuffed
	armchair, sits down.  His face is stern, as he looks into
	HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Give me a drop of anisette.

	HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

				DON CORLEONE
		My wife was weeping before she fell
		asleep, outside my window I saw my
		caporegimes to the house, and it is
		midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine,
		I think you should tell your Don
		what everyone knows.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was
		about to come up and wake you and
		tell you.  Just now.

				DON CORLEONE
		But you needed a drink first.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now you've had your drink.

	Pause.

				HAGEN
		They shot Sonny on the Causeway.
			  (pause)
		He's dead.

	DON CORLEONE blinks.  One feels that just for a second he
	loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of
	him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		I want no inquiries made.  No acts
		of vengeance.
			  (pause)
		Consigliere, arrange a meeting with
		the heads of the five
		families...this war stops now.

	He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

				DON CORLEONE
		Call Bonasera...he will do me a
		service.

	And leaves.  HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

				HAGEN
		This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

				BONASERA (O.S.)
		Yes, I understand I'm listening.

				HAGEN
		You owe the Don a service.  He has
		no doubt that you will repay it.

	EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

	Day in Manhattan.  An impressive Bank Building in the
	financial center of New York.  Many limousines are parked,
	uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

	INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

	CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,
	sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a
	MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and
	settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;
	as the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

				DON CORLEONE (O.S.)
		I want to thank you all for coming.
		I consider it a service done to me
		personally and I am in the debt of
		each and every one of you.
		Especially those of you who have
		traveled from such distances as
		California, St. Louis, Kansas City;
		and New Orleans...

	The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both
	younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,
	short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the
	table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his
	JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an
	older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO
	CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then
	DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair
	and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his
	early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at
	CONNIE's Wedding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Ah well, let's get down to business.
		We are all honorable men here, we
		don't have to give assurances as if
		we were lawyers.
			  (he sits, gazes out
			  at them, and sighs)
		How did things ever go so far?
		Well, no matter.  A lot of
		foolishness has come to pass.  It
		was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

	The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.  A
	large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,
	and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during
	the day's trading, and projected above.

	DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia has lost a son; I have
		lost a son.  We are quits.  Let
		there be a peace...
			  (he gestures
			  expressively,
			  submissively, with
			  his hands)
		That is all I want...

				BARZINI
		Don Corleone is too modest.  He had
		the judges and politicians in his
		pocket and he refused to share them.
		His refusal is not the act of a
		friend.  He takes the bread out of
		the mouths of our families.  Times
		have changed, it's not like the old
		days where everyone can go his own
		way.  If Don Corleone had all the
		judges and politicians in New York,
		then he must share them or let
		others use them.  Certainly he can
		present a bill for such services,
		we're not Communists, after all.
		But he has to let us draw water
		from the well.  It's that simple.

				DON CORLEONE
		My friends, I didn't refuse out of
		malice.  You all know me.  When
		have I ever refused an accommodation?
		But why, this time?  Because I
		think this drug business will
		destroy us in the years to come.
		It's not like whiskey or gambling
		or even women which most people
		want and is forbidden them by the
		pezzonovante of the Church and the
		Government.  But drugs?  No.  Even
		policemen, who help us in gambling
		and other things would refuse to
		help us in drugs.  But...I am
		willing to do whatever all of you
		think is necessary.

				DON ZALUCHI
		I don't believe in drugs.  For
		years I paid my people extra so
		they wouldn't do that kind of
		business...$200 a week.  But it
		didn't matter.  Somebody comes to
		them and says, "I have powders, if
		you put up three, four thousand
		dollar investment, we can make
		fifty thousand distributing."  Who
		can resist such a profit?
		There's no way to control it, as a
		business...to keep it respectable.
			  (rapping the table)
		I don't want it near schools!  I
		don't want it sold to children.
		That is an infamita.
			  (thinking)
		In my city I would try to keep the
		traffic in the dark people, the
		colored.  They are the best
		customers, the least troublesome,
		and they are animals anyway.  They
		have no respect for their wives or
		their families or themselves.  Let
		them lose their souls with drugs.
		But something has to be done, we
		can't have everybody running around
		doing just what they please, like a
		bunch of anarchists.

				BARZINI
		Then, are we agreed; the traffic in
		drugs will be permitted, but
		controlled; and Don Corleone agrees
		to give it protection in the East.

	DON CORLEONE nods.

				BARZINI
		That's the whole matter then, we
		have the peace, and let me pay my
		respects to Don Corleone, whom we
		have all known over the years as a
		man of his word.
			  (noticing TATTAGLIA
			  is uneasy)
		Don Philip?

				TATTAGLIA
		I agree to everything here, I'm
		willing to forget my own misfortune.
		But I must hear strict assurance
		from Corleone.  When time goes by
		and his position becomes stronger,
		will he attempt any individual
		vengeance?

	They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that
	DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something
	else in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.

				DON CORLEONE
		I forego my vengeance for my dead
		son, for the common good.  But I
		have selfish reasons.  My youngest
		son had to flee, accused of
		Sollozzo's murder, and I must now
		make arrangements so that he can
		come home with safety, cleared of
		all those false charges.  That is
		my affair, and I will make those
		arrangements.
			  (with strength)
		But I am a superstitious man...and
		so if some unlucky accident should
		befall my youngest son, if some
		police officer should accidentally
		shoot him, or if he should hang
		himself in his cell, or if my son
		is struck by a bolt of lightning,
		then I will blame some of the
		people here.  That, I could never
		forgive, but...aside from that, let
		me swear by the souls of my
		Grandchildren that I will never be
		the one to break the peace we have
		made.

	EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

	The DON's black limousine.  He sits quietly in the padded
	rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

	It is night.  Lights flash by them every so often.

				HAGEN
		When I meet with Tattaglia's
		people; should I insist that all
		his drug middle-men be clean?

				DON CORLEONE
		Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini
		is a man who will know that without
		being told.

				HAGEN
		You mean Tattaglia.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (shaking his head)
		Barzini.

				HAGEN
			  (a revelation)
		He was the one behind Sollozzo?

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could
		never have outfought Santino.  But
		I wasn't sure until this day.  No,
		it was Barzini all along.

	The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

	------------------------------------------FADE OUT------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

	A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and
	downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left
	grotesque and misshapen.

	GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea
	jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

	THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on
	either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his
	shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple
	honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,
	and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry
	knapsacks.

	The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,
	overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

	EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD

	The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make
	their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn
	sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
	An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The
	car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods
	respectfully.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Michael, why must you do this.  We
		have been lucky so far, all these
		months you've been here we've kept
		your name a secret.  It is from
		love for your father that I've
		asked you never to more than an
		hour from the Villa.

				MICHAEL
		Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;
		nothing will happen.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		You must understand that your
		Father's enemies have friends in
		Palermo.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		Corleone.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		There is nothing there.  Not anymore.

				MICHAEL
		I was told that my Grandfather was
		murdered on its main street; and
		his murderers came to kill my
		father there when he was twelve
		years old.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Long ago.  Now there is nothing:
		the men killed each other in family
		vendettas...the others escaped to
		America.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino...I should see this
		place.

	DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		That is your birthright...but
		Michael, use this car.

				MICHAEL
		No...I would like to walk to
		Corleone.

	The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Be careful Michael, don't let them
		know your name.

	The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues
	on his journey.

	EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

	The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit
	trees, in bloom and bursting with life.

	EXT DAY: VILLAGE

	They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the
	post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the
	empty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only
	gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there
	are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

	The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main
	road "VOTA COMMUNISTA".

	EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

	They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally
	a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

	EXT DAY: FIELD

	Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession
	of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,
	marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men
	carrying billowing red banners.

	EXT DAY: GROVE

	They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees
	is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

	The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out
	loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

	MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

				FABRIZZIO
		You tell us about America.

				MICHAEL
		How do you know I come from America?

				FABRIZZIO
		We hear.  We were told you were a
		Pezzonovanta...big shot.

				MICHAEL
		Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.

				FABRIZZIO
		Hey America!  Is she as rich as
		they say?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				FABRIZZIO
		Take me to America!  You need a
		good lupara in America?
			  (pats his shotgun)
		You take me, I'll be the best man
		you got.  "Oh say, can you
		seeee...By da star early light..."

	MICHAEL laughs.

	EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

	The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military
	convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of
	the U.S. drivers, as they move by.

				FABRIZZIO
		America.
		Hey America!
		Take me with you!
		Hey, take me to America G.I.!

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL

	They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until
	they hesitate, and look down.

				CALO
		Corleone.

	They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET

	MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of
	the village.  They walk behind him, and spread to either
	side about fifteen feet away from him.

	They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
	MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
	They go on.

	They move up a very narrow old street.  MICHAEL looks at the
	doorways that they pass.

	MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

	CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

				CALO
		The names of the dead.

	MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.  He looks.

	The street is empty, barren.  Occasionally, an old woman
	will pass.

	MICHAEL turns his head.

	The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

	A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old
	street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

	A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.  Further ahead
	is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been
	discovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of
	young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,
	dressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla,
	purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon
	blossoms.  They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

	MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this
	Fantasy-like scene.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (calling out to them)
		Hey, beautiful girls!

				MICHAEL
			  (sternly)
		Shhhhh.

	He settles down to watch.

	The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that
	cling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, but
	developed and womanly.

	They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not
	aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
	Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them
	playfully, in the direction of the grove.

	The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her
	left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws
	them back at her pursuers laughing.

	They come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, she
	poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the
	view of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes about
	to run.

	MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks.

	Her face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair
	and a rich mouth.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (murmuring)
		Jesus Christ, take my soul.  I'm
		dying.

	Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

	MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.  We hold
	on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS
	laughing.  Then he turns to them.

				FABRIZZIO
		You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

	CALO pats him on the shoulder.

				CALO
		Easy man.

				MICHAEL
		What are you talking about?

				FABRIZZIO
		You can't hide it when you're hit
		by the thunderbolt.

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

	The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,
	is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

	MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central
	square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

	The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;
	he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at
	their table.

				FABRIZZIO
		You know all the girls in this
		town, eh?  We saw some beauties
		coming down the road.  One in
		particular got our friend hit with
		the Thunderbolt...
			  (he indicates MICHAEL)

	VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with
	new interest.

				VITELLI
		You had better bring a few bottles
		home with you, my friend; you'll
		need help sleeping tonight.
			  (he laughs)

				FABRIZZIO
		This one could seduce the devil.  A
		body! and eyes as big and black as
		olives.

				VITELLI
			  (laughing with
			  them...pouring more wine)
		I know about what you mean!

				FABRIZZIO
		This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?

				VITELLI
			  (laughing)
		Beautiful all over, eh?

				FABRIZZIO
		And hair.  Black and curly, like a
		doll.  And such a mouth.

	VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

				VITELLI
		Yes, we have beautiful girls here...
		but virtuous.

	VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

				MICHAEL
		She wore a red dress, and a red
		ribbon in her hair.  She looks more
		Greek than Italian.  Do you know a
		beauty like that?

	As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,
	until he wears a scowl.

				VITELLI
		No.

	Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

				FABRIZZIO
		God in Heaven, I think I
		understand...

	He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he
	returns.

				FABRIZZIO
		Let's get out of here; he's boiling
		up his blood to do us mischief.
		It's his daughter.

	They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

				CALO
		Come quickly.

				MICHAEL
		Innkeeper.  More wine!

				FABRIZZIO
			  (whispered)
		The old bastard mentioned two sons
		he only has to whistle up.

	MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

				MICHAEL
		Tell him to come to me.

	The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in
	a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI
	between them.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		I understand I've offended you by
		talking about your daughter.  I
		offer you my apologies, I'm a
		stranger in this country, I don't
		know the customs very well.  Let me
		say this, I meant no disrespect to
		you or her...

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

				VITELLI
			  (shrugs)
		Who are you and what do you want
		from my daughter?

				MICHAEL
		I am an American hiding in Sicily
		from the police of my country.  My
		name is Michael.  You can inform
		the police and make your fortune
		but then your daughter would lose a
		father rather than gain a husband.
		In any case, I want to meet your
		daughter.  With your permission and
		under the supervision of your
		family.  With all decorum.  With
		all respect.  I am an honorable man.

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then
	asks:

				VITELLI
		Are you a friend of the friends?

				MICHAEL
		When the proper time comes, I'll
		tell you everything that a wife's
		father should know.

				FABRIZZIO
		It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

				VITELLI
			  (formally)
		Come Sunday morning:  My name is
		Vitelli and my house is up there on
		the hill, above the village.

				MICHAEL
		Your daughter's name?

				VITELLI
		Appolonia.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from
	Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an
	Alfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday
	best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their
	luparas on their shoulders.

	DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,
	rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

	The Sunday churchbells ring.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE

	MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by
	the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the
	MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
	Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate
	Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to
	APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives
	her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light
	at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.

	She looks at him.

				APPOLONIA
		Grazia.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE

	Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's
	cafe.

	MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,
	though they are all dressed differently.

	They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is
	talking and talking.

	MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
	She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME

	MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,
	seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

	As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a
	half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces
	further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on
	their shoulders.

	Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,
	and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.  She modestly regains
	her balance, and they continue walking.

	Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH

	Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out.  Music, old and
	dissonant, plays.

	There is a bridal procession in the street of the village;
	the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five
	hundred years ago.

	Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant
	flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white
	confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by
	countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

	We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with
	all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in
	Sicily.

	APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome
	despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE

	CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the
	great wedding celebration.  It is held in the Village
	Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the
	tops of buildings, carrying luparas.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

	MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight
	fills the room.

	He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA.  A
	little frightened; but lovely.

	He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,
	looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

	Slowly and tenderly he kisses her.  Her tiny hands come up
	to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

	She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

	Morning.  MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the
	room.

	APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially
	covered by the bedsheets.

	He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

	We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving
	erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost
	hitting th inner court wall.

	APPOLONIA is laughing, driving.  MICHAEL pretends to be
	frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

	Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking
	guard duty.

	The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

				MICHAEL
		It's safer to teach you English.

				APPOLONIA
		Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
		Thursday, Friday...See, I learned
		it.  Now teach me to drive!

	DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.  He seems tired and
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Ciao, Don Tommassino.

	APPOLONIA kisses him.

				MICHAEL
		Things went badly in Palermo?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		The younger men have no respect.
		Things are changing; I don't know
		what will happen.  Michael, because
		of the wedding, people now know
		your name.

				MICHAEL
		Is that why there are more men on
		the walls?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Even so, I don't think it is safe
		here anymore.  I've made plans to
		move you to a villa near Siracuse.
		You must go right away.

				MICHAEL
		What is it?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Bad news from America.  Your
		brother, Santino.  He has been
		killed.

	For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the
	Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	Morning.  MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

	Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,
	combing his thick hair.

	MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

				MICHAEL
		Get the car.  I'll be leaving in
		ten minutes.  Where's Calo?

				FABRIZZIO
		Calo is having a cup of coffee in
		the kitchen.  Is your wife coming
		with you?

				MICHAEL
		No, she's going home to her family.
		She'll join me in a few weeks...

	INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

	MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the
	kitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he
	sees MICHAEL.

				CALO
		Should I get your bag?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia?

				CALO
			  (smiling)
		She is sitting in the driver's seat
		of the car, dying to step on the
		gas.  She'll be a real American
		woman before she gets to America.

	MICHAEL smiles.

				MICHAEL
		Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
		the car.

	He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

	He looks out from the opening in the doorway.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's
	seat, playing with the wheel like a child.

	CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear
	seat.

	Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

	Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO
	disappear through the gate.

				MICHAEL
			  (muttering to himself)
		Where the hell is he going?

	MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

	MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer
	courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

	APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay
	where he is.

				APPOLONIA
			  (calling out)
		I'll drive to you.

	He smiles affectionately.

	CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling
	by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the
	smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds
	out his hand.

				MICHAEL
		No.  No!

	His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,
	as she switched on the ignition.

	Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;
	and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

	MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

	INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

	MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear
	whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft
	cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON
	TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and
	from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

				MICHAEL
		Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know
		that the one who gives me Fabrizzio
		will own the finest pastures in
		Sicily.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

	Easter.

	A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes
	of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children
	and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,
	searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden
	Easter eggs.

	The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing
	baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around
	his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

	Suddenly, he stops and looks.

	MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

	Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in
	MICHAEL's direction.

	MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son
	and embraces him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Be my son...

	INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

	DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the
	building.

				DON CORLEONE
		This old building has seen its day.
		No way to do business...too small,
		too old.

	They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

				DON CORLEONE
		Have you thought about a wife?  A
		family?

				MICHAEL
			  (pained)
		No.

				DON CORLEONE
		I understand, Michael.  But you
		must make a family, you know.

				MICHAEL
		I want children, I want a family.
		But I don't know when.

				DON CORLEONE
		Accept what's happened, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I could accept everything that's
		happened; I could accept it, but
		that I never had a choice.  From
		the time I was born, you had laid
		this all out for me.

				DON CORLEONE
		No, I wanted other things for you.

				MICHAEL
		You wanted me to be your son.

				DON CORLEONE
		Yes, but sons who would be
		professors, scientists,
		musicians...and grandchildren who
		could be, who knows, a Governor, a
		President even, nothing's impossible
		here in America.

				MICHAEL
		Then why have I become a man like
		you?

				DON CORLEONE
		You are like me, we refuse to be
		fools, to be puppets dancing on a
		string pulled by other men.  I
		hoped the time for guns and killing
		and massacres was over.  That was
		my misfortune.  That was your
		misfortune.  I was hunted on the
		streets of Corleone when I was
		twelve years old because of who my
		father was.  I had no choice.

				MICHAEL
		A man has to choose what he will be.
		I believe that.

				DON CORLEONE
		What else do you believe in?

	MICHAEL doesn't answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family.  Can you
		believe in your country?  Those
		Pezzonovante of the State who
		decide what we shall do with our
		lives?  Who declare wars they wish
		us to fight in to protect what they
		own.  Do you put your fate in the
		hands of men whose only talent is
		that they tricked a bloc of people
		to vote for them?  Michael, in five
		years the Corleone family can be
		completely legitimate.  Very
		difficult things have to happen to
		make that possible.  I can't do
		them anymore, but you can, if you
		choose to.

	MICHAEL listens.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family; believe in a
		Code of Honor, older and higher,
		believe in Roots that go back
		thousands of years into your Race.
		Make a family, Michael, and protect
		it.  These are our affairs, sono cosa
		nostra, Governments only protect
		men who have their own individual
		power.  Be one of those men...you
		have the choice.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)

	A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		There's a new one.  Construction
		going on everywhere.

	MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the
	bill marquees read: "MARTIN AND LEWIS", "PATTI PAGE", etc.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		That's one of the family's new ones.
		Not bad, eh?

	EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)

	The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.

	Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,
	NERI, quiet and sinister.

				MICHAEL
		Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the
		airport?

				FREDO
		He had business at the hotel, but
		he'll drop in for dinner.

	From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a
	discourtesy.

	INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)

	A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of
	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI.  Great fuss is made.  They are
	being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.

				FREDO
		You look wonderful, kid; really
		wonderful.  That doctor did some
		job on your face.

				MICHAEL
		You look good, too.

	They enter the suite.

				FREDO
		Nice, eh?

	FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the
	bellboys, waiters and maids.

				FREDO
			  (hurrying into the bedroom)
		Kid, take a look-see.

	MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.

	There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,
	mirrors to each side.  FREDO points upward.

	A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.

				FREDO
		Ever seen anything like that before?

				MICHAEL
			  (dryly)
		No.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom.  He is just finishing
	dressing; he puts on his jacket.  From the window, with the
	lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night.  MICHAEL
	passes into the other room.

	He stops, looks.  He is disturbed.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;
	a lavish table setting for eight.  Standing by the table are
	HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,
	beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.
	NERI stands quietly by the door.

				FREDO
		Mike!  The party starting!

				MICHAEL
		Come here a minute, Fredo.

	FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.

				MICHAEL
		Who are those girls?

				FREDO
			  (jokingly)
		That's for you to find out.

				MICHAEL
		Give them some money and send them
		home.

				FREDO
		Mike!

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of them...

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.
	MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Corleone family is
		thinking of selling out all our
		interests in the Olive Oil business
		and settling here.  Moe Greene will
		sell us his interest so it can be
		wholly owned by friends of the
		family.

	FREDDIE seems anxious.

				FREDO
		Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
		He never mentioned it to me and he
		loves the business.

				MICHAEL
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Don wants you to help
		us get started.  We figure
		entertainment will be the big
		factor in drawing gamblers.  We
		hope you'll sign a contract to
		appear five times a year for maybe
		a week long engagement.
		We hope your friends in the movies
		will do the same.  We count on you
		to convince them.

				JOHNNY
		Sure, I'll do anything for my
		Godfather.  You know that, Mike.

	There is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,
	who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,
	followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed
	in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast
	style.

				MOE
		Mike, good to see you.  Got
		everything you want?

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

				MOE
		The chef cooked for you special;
		the dancers will kick your tongue
		out and you credit is good!
			  (to his BODYGUARDS)
		Draw chips for all these people so
		they can play on the house.

				MICHAEL
		Is my credit good enough to buy you
		out?

	MOE laughs.

				MOE
		Buy me out?...

				MICHAEL
		The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone
		family wants to buy you out.

	GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes
	the BODYGUARDS.

				MOE
			  (furious)
		The Corleone family wants to buy me
		out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy
		me out.

				MICHAEL
		Your casino loses money.  Maybe we
		can do better.

				MOE
		You think I scam?

				MICHAEL
			  (the worst insult)
		You're unlucky.

				MOE
		You goddamn dagos.  I do you a
		favor and take Freddie in when
		you're having a bad time, and then
		you try to push me out.

				MICHAEL
		You took Freddie in because the
		Corleone family bankrolled your
		casino.  You and the Corleone
		family are evened out.  This is for
		business; name your price.

				MOE
		The Corleone family don't have that
		kind of muscle anymore.  The
		Godfather is sick.  You're getting
		chased out of New York by Barzini
		and the other families, and you
		think you can find easier pickings
		here.  I've talked to Barzini; I
		can make a deal with him and keep
		my hotel!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly, deadly)
		Is that why you thought you could
		slap Freddie around in public?

				FREDO
			  (his face turns red)
		Ah Mike, that was nothing.  Moe
		didn't mean anything.  He flies off
		the handle sometimes; but me and
		him are good friends.  Right, Moe?

				MOE
		Yeah sure.  Sometimes I gotta kick
		asses to make this place run right.
		Freddie and I had a little argument
		and I had to straighten him out.

				MICHAEL
		You straightened my brother out?

				MOE
		Hell, he was banging cocktail
		waitresses two at a time.  Players
		couldn't get a drink.

	MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:

				MICHAEL
		I have to go back to New York
		tomorrow.  Think of your price.

				MOE
		You son of a bitch, you think you
		can brush me off like that?  I made
		my bones when you were going out
		with cheerleaders.

				FREDO
			  (frightened)
		Tom, you're the Consigliere; you
		can talk to the Don and advise him.

				MICHAEL
		The Don has semi-retired.  I'm
		running the Family business now.
		So anything you have to say, say it
		to me.

	Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.
	MOE exits angrily.

				MICHAEL
		Freddie, you're my older brother.
		I love you.  But don't ever take
		sides with anybody against the
		Family again.

	EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)

	KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark
	AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.

	She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who
	plays with a cardboard bird on a string.

	Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have
	learned to tell are bodyguards.

	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO
	PORTERS carrying luggage.

	NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.

	MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.

	LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and
	MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically,
	the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;
	and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the
	other cars.

	And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other
	sedans.

	INT DAY: LIMO (1955)

	The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.

				MICHAEL
		I have to see my father and his
		people when we get back to the Mall.

				KAY
		Oh Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go to the show tomorrow
		night--we can change the tickets.

				KAY
		Don't you want dinner first?

				MICHAEL
		No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

				KAY
		Wake me up when you come to bed?

	The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding
	limousine window.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The limousine arrives at the Mall.  We are inside.

				KAY
		Your sister wants to ask you
		something.

				MICHAEL
		Let HER ask.

	NERI opens the door.  KAY wants to talk just a little more.

				KAY
		She's afraid to.  Michael...

	MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment
	longer.

				KAY
		Why are you so cold to her and
		Carlo?  They live with us on the
		Mall now, but you never get close
		to them.

				MICHAEL
		I'm busy.

				KAY
		Connie and Carlo want you to be
		godfather to their little boy.

	NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

	He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.

				KAY
		Will you?

				MICHAEL
		Let me think about it, O.K.?

	She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY
	and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

	VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size.  He
	wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt.  He sits in a
	chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Barzini's people chisel my territory
		and we do nothing about it.  Pretty
		soon there won't be one place in
		Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Just be patient.

				TESSIO
		I'm not asking you for help, Mike.
		Just take off the handcuffs.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Be patient.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at
		least recruit our regimes to full
		strength.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No, I don't want to give Barzini an
		excuse to start fighting.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Mike, you're wrong.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...Don Corleone.

	The OLD MAN looks up.  CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.
	Beside him is an anxious TESSIO.  NERI stands by the door;
	HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.

				CLEMENZA
		You said there would come a day
		when Tessio and me could form our
		own Families.  Only with your
		benediction, of course.  I ask
		permission...

				DON CORLEONE
		My son is head of the Family now.
		If you have his permission, you
		have my good will.

				MICHAEL
		In six months you can break off
		from the Corleone Family and go on
		your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on
		you to make the move to Nevada;
		you'll be my right-hand man out
		there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the
		Consigliere.

	Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.
	He remains inexpressive.

				MICHAEL
		He's going to be our lawyer in
		Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any
		other business as of now, this
		minute.  No reflection on Tom;
		that's the way I want it.  Besides,
		if I ever need any advice, who's a
		better Consigliere than my father.

				CLEMENZA
		Then in a six month time we're on
		our own; is that it?

				MICHAEL
		Maybe less...

				TESSIO
		Let us fill up our Regimes.

				MICHAEL
		No.  I want things very calm for
		another six months.

				TESSIO
		Forgive me, Godfather, let our
		years of friendship be my excuse.
		How can you hope for success there
		without your strength here to back
		you up?  The two  go hand in hand.
		And with you gone from here the
		Barzini and the Tattaglias will be
		too strong for us.

				CLEMENZA
		And I don't like Barzini.  I say
		the Corleone Family has to move
		from strength, not weakness.  We
		should build our Regimes and take
		back our lost territories in Staten
		Island, at least.

				DON CORLEONE
		Do you have faith in my judgement?

				CLEMENZA
		Yes, Godfather...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then do what Michael says...

				MICHAEL
		All I can say is that things are
		being resolved that are more
		effective than a thousand buttonmen
		on the streets.  Understood?

	There are uneasy looks all around.

				CARLO
		Understood.  I just wish I was
		doing more to help out.

				MICHAEL
		I'll come to you when I need you.

	He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod,
	reluctantly.

				MICHAEL
		All right, then it's resolved.

	NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

	CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,
	then CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the
	corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

	Then NERI closes the door.

	MICHAEL relaxes.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why are you cutting me out of
		the action?

				MICHAEL
		Tom, we're going to be legitimate
		all the way, and you're the legal
		man.  What could be more important
		than that.

				HAGEN
		I'm not talking about that.  I'm
		talking about Rocco Lampone building
		a secret regime.  Why does Neri
		report directly to you, rather than
		through me or a caporegime?

				DON CORLEONE
		I told you that it wouldn't escape
		his eye.

				MICHAEL
		How did you find out?

				HAGEN
		Bookkeepers know everything.
		Rocco's men are all a little too
		good for the jobs they're supposed
		to be doing.  They get a little
		more money than the job's worth.
			  (pause)
		Lampone's a good man; he's operating
		perfectly.

				MICHAEL
		Not so perfectly if you noticed.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why am I out?

				MICHAEL
		You're not a wartime Consigliere.
		Things may get tough with the move
		we're trying.

				HAGEN
		OK, but then I agree with Tessio.
		You're going about it all wrong;
		you're making the move out of
		weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and
		if he tears you apart, the other
		families won't come running to help
		the Corleones...

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, I never thought you were a bad
		Consigliere, I thought Santino a
		bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a
		good heart but he wasn't the right
		man to head the family when I had
		my misfortune.  Michael has all my
		confidence, as you do.  For reasons
		which you can't know, you must have
		no part in what will happen.

				HAGEN
		Maybe I can help.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You're out, Tom.

	TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM
	leaves.

	MICHAEL looks at NERI.

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to talk to my father.

	NERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors,
	breathes in the air, and steps outside.

	EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

				DON CORLEONE
		I see you have your Luca Brasi.

				MICHAEL
		I'll need him.

				DON CORLEONE
		There are men in this world who
		demand to be killed.  They argue in
		gambling games; they jump out of
		their cars in a rage if someone so
		much as scratches their fender.
		These people wander through the
		streets calling out "Kill me, kill
		me."  Luca Brasi was like that.
		And since he wasn't scared of
		death, and in fact, looked for
		it...I made him my weapon.  Because
		I was the only person in the world
		that he truly hoped would not kill
		him.  I think you have done the
		same with this man.

	They walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes,
	peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
	MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then
	stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

				DON CORLEONE
		Barzini will move against you first.

				MICHAEL
		How?

				DON CORLEONE
		He will get in touch with you
		through someone you absolutely
		trust.  That person will arrange a
		meeting, guarantee your safety...

	He rises, and looks at Michael...

				DON CORLEONE
		...and at that meeting you will be
		assassinated.

	The DON walks on further.

				DON CORLEONE
		Your wife and children...you're
		happy with them?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.

	MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

				MICHAEL
		I've always respected you...

	A long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

				DON CORLEONE
		And I...you.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left
	them off.

				KAY
		How is your husband feeling?

				MAMA
		He's not the same since they shot
		him.  He lets Michael do all the
		work.  He just plays the fool with
		his garden, his peppers, his
		tomatoes, as if he was some peasant
		still.  But men are like that...

	She stops toward the Church.

				MAMA
		You come in, too.

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
		The Priest ain't gonna bite you
		cause you're not Catholic.
			  (whispered)
		He's in the back drinkin' his wine.

	KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
	They enter.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from
	the holy water.

				MAMA
		You can.

	Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and
	blesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in
	awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally
	the Altar.

	MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a
	large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting
	candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives
	her some.

	MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the
	taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great
	dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights
	twenty candles.

	She finishes, and bows her head.

	EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

	Very few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black
	flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
	An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
	Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

	Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration.  We show
	these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to
	Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The
	Sacred Heart"...

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Silence.

	The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill
	all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

	Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the
	wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is
	somber and respectful.

	MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform
	which holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of
	Don Corleone.

	BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved
	family.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely
	with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

	The VIEW ALTERS,

	and we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears
	openly falling, takes his turn.

	Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last
	look at the great man.

	CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE
	immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York
	Families to pay their respects.

	First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP
	TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

	Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

	MICHAEL watches the scene.

	BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined
	by his men.

	As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on
	him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear
	from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that
	he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don
	Corleone.

	MICHAEL watches silently.

	BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First
	CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.

	CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He
	embraces and comforts her.

	Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching
	all who come close to him.

	EXT DAY: MALL (LATER)

	Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are
	still hundreds of mourners.

	A young GIRL approaches TESSIO.  She's about 18.

				GIRL
		Do you remember me?

				TESSIO
		No...

				GIRL
		We danced together at Connie's
		wedding.

	TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',
	and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He
	finds him.

				TESSIO
		Mike, could I have a minute?

	MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close
	by.

				TESSIO
		Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
		Says we can straighten any of our
		problems out.

				MICHAEL
		He talked to you?

				TESSIO
			  (nods)
		I can arrange security.

	MICHAEL looks at him.

	EXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)

	The Cemetery.  Late day.

	The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the
	stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in
	Queens Village.

	Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take
	pictures, etc.

	MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Christ, Tom; I needed more time
		with him.  I really needed him.

				HAGEN
		Did he give you his politicians?

				MICHAEL
		Not all...I needed another four
		months and I would have had them
		all.
			  (he looks at TOM)
		I guess you've figured it all out?

				HAGEN
		How will they come at you?

				MICHAEL
		I know now.
			  (a passion wells up
			  inside of MICHAEL)
		I'll make them call me Don.

				HAGEN
		Have you agreed on a meeting?

				MICHAEL
			  (nods)
		A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn
		on Tessio's ground, where I'll be
		safe.

	HAGEN looks at him; understands.

				MICHAEL
		But after the Baptism.  I've
		decided to stand as godfather to
		Connie's baby.

	They look up.

	The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which
	stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,
	with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)

	ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he
	pulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we
	see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's
	uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
	Then the badge, and the identification card; with his
	picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he
	begins to dress.

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in
	their room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is
	beginning to take on a matronly look.

	INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)

	In a Long Island motel.

	ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,
	checks it, and puts it back together.

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)

	PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates,
	takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then
	gets in, drives off.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The Church.

	Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the
	Church.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
	Not all of the participants have arrived yet.

	CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the
	infant; showing him off to interested people.

	EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)

	NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN
	Building.  He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a
	policeman.  He carries a huge flashlight.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

	LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort
	Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising
	"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY".

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.

	CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and
	MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.

				PRIEST
			  (to MICHAEL)
		Do you pledge to guide and protect
		this child if he is left fatherless?
		Do you promise to shield him
		against the wickedness of the world?

				MICHAEL
		Yes, I promise.

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.

	NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He
	continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On
	his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly
	across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he
	approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his
	nightstick.

	The DRIVER looks up in surprise.

	NERI points to the "No Parking" sign.

	The DRIVER turns his head away.

				NERI
		OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or
		you wanna move?

				DRIVER
			  (obviously a hood)
		You better check with your precinct.

				NERI
		Move it!

	The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,
	and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's
	jacket.

	NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then
	he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

				NERI
		Let me see you license and
		registration.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

	LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.
	It parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he
	returns into the room.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He
	rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.  Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently
	applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

				PRIEST
		Ephetha...be opened...So you may
		perceive the fragrance of God's
		sweetness.

	EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)

	The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center
	is arguing with NERI.

	Now the DRIVER looks up.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving
	glass doors.

	NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass
	doors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of
	BARZINI within them.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.  The PRIEST hands him
	the infant.

				PRIEST
		Do you renounce Satan.

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce him.

				PRIEST
		And all his works?

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce them.

	INT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)

	LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down
	the iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.
	PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a
	semi-nude young GIRL leans up.

	They are riddled with gunfire.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with
	his package.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant
	MICHAEL holds.

				PRIEST
		Do you wish to be baptized?

				MICHAEL
		I do wish to be baptized.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

	CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.

	He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate
	elevator waiting shaft.

	The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.

	The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with
	the dapper MOE GREENE.

	CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.

	The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.

				PRIEST
		I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.

	Flash bulbs go off.  Everyone is smiles, and crowds around
	MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The christening party outside the Church.

	Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to
	receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

	Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

	As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.  LAMPONE gets out
	and works his way to MICHAEL.  He whispers in his ear.  This
	is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

	CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

				CONNIE
		Kiss your Godfather.

	The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an
	excuse to back away.

				MICHAEL
		Carlo...we've had a change in the
		plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the
		kids will have to take the trip out
		to Vegas without us.

				CONNIE
		Oh Mike, it's our first vacation
		together.

				CARLO
			  (anxious to please)
		Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...

				MICHAEL
		Go back to your house and wait for
		me...

	He kisses KAY.

				MICHAEL
			  (to KAY)
		I'll just be a couple of days...

	People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to
	drive off.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

	TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.

	HAGEN enters.

				HAGEN
		You'd better make your call to
		Barzini; Michael's ready.

	TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.

				TESSIO
		We're on our way to Brooklyn.

	He hangs up and smiles.

				TESSIO
		I hope Mike can get us a good deal
		tonight.

				HAGEN
			  (gravely)
		I'm sure he will.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car.  On their
	way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

				BUTTON MAN
		The boss says he'll come in a
		separate car.  He says for you two
		to go on ahead.

				TESSIO
			  (frowning)
		Hell, he can't do that.  It screws
		up all my arrangements.

	THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

				HAGEN
			  (gently)
		I can't go with you either, Tessio.

	He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he
	panics, and then he accepts it.

				TESSIO
			  (after the pause)
		Tell Mike it was business...I
		always liked him.

				HAGEN
		He understands that.

	TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.

				TESSIO
			  (softly)
		Tom, can you get me off the hook?
		For old times' sake?

				HAGEN
		I can't.

	HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about
	twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.

	TESSIO is led into a waiting car.

	HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather
	nervously.  He moves to the window and looks out.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,
	LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

	They move toward us.

	Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.

	He wears a broad smile.

				CARLO
		Godfather!

				MICHAEL
		You have to answer for Santino.

	The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish
	attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and
	backs into the living room.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	The door opens, and the grim party enters.

				MICHAEL
		You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
		people.  That little farce you
		played out with my sister.  Did
		Barzini kid you that would fool a
		Corleone?

				CARLO
			  (dignity)
		I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on
		the head of my children, I'm
		innocent.  Mike, don't do this to
		me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		Barzini is dead.  So is Philip
		Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
		and Moe Greene...I want to square
		all the family accounts tonight.
		So don't tell me you're innocent;
		admit what you did.

	CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

				MICHAEL
			  (almost kindly)
		Don't be frightened.  Do you think
		I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you
		think I'd make your children
		fatherless?  After all, I'm
		Godfather to your son.  No, your
		punishment is that you're out of
		the family business.  I'm putting
		you on a plane to Vegas--and I want
		you to stay there.  I'll send
		Connie an allowance, that's all.
		But don't keep saying you're
		innocent; it insults my intelligence
		and makes me angry.  Who approached
		you, Tattaglia or Barzini?

				CARLO
			  (sees his way out)
		Barzini.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Good, good.  Leave now; there's a
		car waiting to take you to the
		airport.

	CARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting;
	with a group of MEN around it.

	He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.

				MICHAEL
		I'll call your wife and tell her
		what flight you're on.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his
	things in the trunk.

	ONE opens the front door for him.

	SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

	CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back
	to see the other man.

	It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

	The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA
	suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes
	and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

	The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

	His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

	Then the body goes slack.

	CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car
	drives off.

	EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

	MICHAEL and his party.  They watch.

	Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

	MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.

	They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights
	flash by.

	NERI turns back.

				NERI
		You know I would never question
		anything you say.

				MICHAEL
			  (smiles)
		Speak your mind.

				NERI
		I'll do this for you; you know I
		should.

				MICHAEL
		No.  This I have to do.

	EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

	MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an
	Italian Pizzeria.  NERI opens the door.

				MICHAEL
		Sit in the car.

	INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

	He walks alone into the restaurant.  A MAN is tossing pizza
	dough in the air.

				MICHAEL
		Where's the boss?

				MAN
		In the back.  Hey Frank, someone
		wants you.

	A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

				MAN
		What is it?

	He stops, frozen in fear.  It is FABRIZZIO.

	VIEW ON MICHAEL.  Gunfire from under his coat.  FABRIZZIO is
	cut down.  MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that
	these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs
	indicating that the property is for sale are evident.

	A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,
	the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,
	restrained by MAMA.  She manages to break free and runs
	across the Mall into Michael's house.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	Inside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed;
	furniture prepared for shipping.

				CONNIE
		Michael!

	She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon
	MICHAEL and KAY.

				KAY
			  (comforting)
		Connie...

	But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI
	is watchful.

				CONNIE
		You lousy bastard; you killed my
		husband...

				KAY
		Connie...

				CONNIE
		You waited until our father died
		and nobody could stop you and you
		killed him, you killed him!  You
		blamed him about Sonny, you always
		did, everybody did.  But you never
		thought about me, never gave a damn
		about me.
			  (crying)
		What am I going to do now, what am
		I going to do.

	TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders
	from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to
	finish.

				KAY
		Connie, how could you say such
		things?

				CONNIE
		Why do you think he kept Carlo on
		the Mall?  All the time he knew he
		was going to kill my husband.  But
		he didn't dare while my father was
		alive.  And then he stood Godfather
		to our child.  That coldhearted
		bastard.
			  (to KAY)
		And do you know how many men he had
		killed with Carlo?  Just read the
		papers.  That's your husband.

	She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria
	she has no saliva.

				MICHAEL
		Get her home and get a doctor.

	The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,
	gently but firmly.

	KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from
	MICHAEL.  He feels her look.

				MICHAEL
		She's hysterical.

	But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

				KAY
		Michael, it's not true.  Please
		tell me.

				MICHAEL
		Don't ask me.

				KAY
		Tell me!

				MICHAEL
		All right, this one time I'll let
		you ask about my affairs, one last
		time.

				KAY
		Is it true?

	She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so
	directly that we know he will tell the truth.

				MICHAEL
			  (after a very long pause)
		No.

	KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs
	him.  Then she kisses him.

				KAY
			  (through her tears)
		We both need a drink.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

	She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the
	drinks.  From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the
	drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the
	house with their BODYGUARDS.

	She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive
	them.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one
	foot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a
	Roman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

	CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

				CLEMENZA
		Don Corleone...

	The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her
	husband has become.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY wears a shawl over her hand.  She drops many coins in
	the coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in
	a pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.

                              I, ROBOT
                           
    FADE IN:

   On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.                                       

    A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
    Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

    A SOUND.   Something SHATTERING...

    Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out
    What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we
    finally. Understand...

                         DISEMBODIED VOICE
               You are in danger...

                                               CUT TO:

   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CLOSE ON                                

    DEL SPOONER'S FACE.    His eyes, snapping open.   His face,
    covered in sweat.

    PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around
    his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
    cheerful.

    Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT
    ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a
    couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.

    You are in danger...

    He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His
    apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of
    someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.

   INT. SHOWER - MORNING                                              

    Spooner turns his face into the jet of water.

   INT. BATHROOM - MORNING                                            

    Shaves with a razor.    Using his left hand.   Knicks the cleft
    of his chin. Shit.

   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                             

    Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan.      Waiting for it
    to boil.

                                                             2.


   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                          

    Heads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his
    neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches
    for the handle. Takes a deep breath and...

   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                  

    ...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the
    elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.

    Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His
    shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He
    turns and sees...

    A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still
    obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering
    hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up
    with a muted WHIR...

                         ROBOT
                   (metallic voice)
               Good day, sir...

    Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to
    lose the robot.

    We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment
    buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.
    PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
    portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:

    Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
    cleaning windows.

    A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
    repairs the street. No human supervision.

    A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.
    Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...

    Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.
    Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.
    Briefcases.

    Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE.

    Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
    Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's
    neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.

                         LITTLE GIRL
               Hi.

                                                              3.


                          SPOONER
               Hi.

    But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The
    robot turns. Looks at the girl.

                         ROBOT
               You are not allowed to talk to
               strangers.

    Spooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb
    Just as...

    THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.   Training its large
    digital EYE on him:

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               Please return to the sidewalk.

    Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               Please return to the sidewalk...

    The traffic signal, tracking him.

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               You are in violation of city
               ordinance 14-B726...

    Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as
    SNAP! It takes his picture.

                                                CUT TO:

   EXT./INT. MONORAIL - MORNING                                    

    Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks
    down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the
    Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!
    A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his
    back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...

   EXT. CITY SCAPE/MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                           

    The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying
    OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings
    wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel
    shields.

    As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
    disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
    The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.

                                                             4.


   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - PLAZA - MORNING                            

     Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging
     Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the
     original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.

   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING                    

     A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
     of glass-enclosed rooms. On the other side a GIANT SCREEN
     with real time video of various streets and buildings.

     Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess.
     A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.
     Several electronic messages say the same thing:

                             SEE ME!

                          LT. BERGIN (O.S.)
                Ever heard the phrase "lead by
                example?"

     Spooner looks up. LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of
     his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner
     giving that traffic signal the finger.

                          SPOONER
                Doesn't ring a bell.

                          LT. BERGIN
                    (pointing to Spooner's
                     badge)
                It's on your badge.

     Spooner takes the citation.   Drops it into a drawer filled
     with about fifty others.

                          LT. BERGIN
                The traffic division filed an
                official complaint this morning.

                          SPOONER
                The traffic division is a machine.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Look, I know there's going to be an
                adjustment period, Del...

                          SPOONER
                    (interrupting)
                I'll send them a letter of apology.
                Maybe some flowers. A box of
                chocolates...

                                                               5.


     JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS.   He throws Bergin a look.
     Then snatches up the receiver.

                          SPOONER
                Spooner, homicide.

                                                 CUT TO:

   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - ESTABLISHING - DAY                        

     A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city
     blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
     ROBOTS.

   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                      

     An elevator opens with a whoosh. Spooner steps out into a
     featureless corridor. His footsteps, echoing. He stops at a
     set of OPPOSING DOORS. Looks over at one, when the other
     suddenly OPENS.

   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS        

     A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold
     metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a
     long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes.
     Old-fashioned suit.

                          OLD MAN
                Hello, there. Please come in.

     Spooner hesitates.

                          OLD MAN
                It's alright. You can sit.     Sit.

     Spooner doesn't.   Looks around the room. The Old Man lifts
     up a coffee pot.   Pours some coffee into a single cup.

                          OLD MAN
                Coffee?

                          SPOONER
                    (interested)
                You're offering me a cup of coffee?

                          OLD MAN
                Yes. But you are to say, "No,
                thank you."

     Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his
     lips, but doesn't take a sip.

                                                       6.


                       OLD MAN
           Coffee?

                       SPOONER
           No.    Thank you.

                     OLD MAN
           As you wish.

The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no
movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee
pot.

                     SPOONER
           You want to tell me something about
           Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death?

The Old Man smiles.

                     OLD MAN
           I want to tell you that his death
           was not a suicide.

                     SPOONER
           And why do you say that?

                      OLD MAN
           Why?   Because I want you to know
           it.

                     SPOONER
           I understand that. But what
           specifically leads you to believe
           that he didn't commit suicide?

                     OLD MAN
               (considers)
           Nothing specifically.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Agitated.

                     SPOONER
           Under normal circumstances that
           wouldn't be enough to get you a
           homicide investigation.

                     OLD MAN
           But this is not "normal
           circumstances," is it, Detective
           Spooner?

                       SPOONER
           No.    It isn't.

                                                               7.


                          OLD MAN
                Then you will find out who killed
                Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you
                will tell me.

     Spooner's losing his patience.

                          SPOONER
                If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll
                find out. And you'll be the first
                to know.....

     JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst
     of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the
     conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in
     front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.

   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                              

     Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT
     ROBOT.

                          ESCORT ROBOT
                Please follow me.

     Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another
     doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief
     glimpse of...

     DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY.

     Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE
     TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then
     continues on.

   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  

     Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open
     automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom
     looking out over the entire complex.

     Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing
     behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a
     conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically
     feel the brains and ambition.

                          SPOONER
                Usually I ask who's in charge...

     Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the
     table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON,
     founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.

                                                         8.


                      SPOONER
            But everyone knows you, Dr.
            Robertson.

Robertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people.

                      ROBERTSON
            Remind me to cut back on my talk
            show appearances.

LAUGHTER.

                      ROBERTSON
            Welcome to U.S. Robotics,
            Detective. I regret you're not
            visiting us under more pleasant
            circumstances. Allow me to
            introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of
            Legal Affairs.

A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods
hello.

                      ROBERTSON
            And the gentleman to my right is
            Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of
            Research.

Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods.

                      ROBERTSON
            They'll be available to answer any
            questions you might have during
            your investigation. You'll
            understand how anxious we are to
            resolve this matter -- especially
            before the press gets wind of it.
            There are some anti-robot
            sentiments out there as you know,
            Detective, and we're not eager to
            stir them up. So. Where would you
            like to begin?

                      SPOONER
            We can begin with whether or not
            the old man put a gun to his head
            and pulled the trigger.

A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.

                      ARONSON
            You don't have to answer that, Dr.
            Robertson...

                                                          9.


Robertson waves him off.

                      ROBERTSON
           Susan?   Perhaps you can assist us
           here?

Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT.
Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN
CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone
but Spooner.

                     CALVIN
           Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid
           personality who generally eschewed
           social relationships. Rejecting
           people in favor of solitary
           activities involving machines. He
           spent almost all his time at the
           lab here or at his lab at home. As
           a result he was highly susceptible
           to depression.

                     ROBERTSON
           Dr. Calvin is our Chief
           Psychologist.

                     SPOONER
           If that was your diagnosis, why
           didn't you see this coming?

Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye.      As if the
answer's obvious.

                     CALVIN
           This is U.S. Robotics, Detective.
           Seventy-five percent of our
           employees fit that description.

                     LANNING
               (interceding)
           You'll have to excuse the doctor.
           We're all a little on edge. This
           has been a difficult and emotional
           morning.

Spooner throws a look around the room.   Then back at Calvin.

                       SPOONER
           Yeah.    I can see you're all broken
           up.

Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism.

                                                           10.


                          ROBERTSON
                Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from
                the very beginnings of this
                company. We developed the "Three
                Laws of Robotics" together. But
                these days science is a young man's
                game. By the time you hit thirty
                your best years are behind you.
                Some of us are kicked upstairs.
                Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky.

     Robertson stands.   Meeting over.

                          ROBERTSON
                Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life.
                I trust you will come to the same
                swift conclusion, Detective. Dr.
                Lanning will make himself available
                if you have any further questions.

     Spooner looks over at Calvin.

                          SPOONER
                I want her to help me.

     Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.

                          CALVIN
                That's not really my department...

                          ROBERTSON
                    (pointed)
                Susan would be happy to assist you.

     And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone. People
     start getting up, gathering up, filing out. Susan Calvin.
     The last one to get up.

   INT. METAL HALLWAY - DAY                                      

     Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in
     before. Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS...

                          SPOONER
                    (under his breath)
                Ah, Christ...Toasters...

     As they duck under the police tape and...

                                                              11.


   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                   

     ...enter Hogenmiller's lab. Alive with activity. CRIME
     SCENE TECHNICIANS, MOBILE ANALYSIS UNITS. LIGHT SCANS,
     running across...

     HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE.   Black gun powder.   Fanning out
     around his contorted lips.

     Spooner. Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS. Everywhere.
     Mostly incomplete. TORSOS. ARMS. LEGS. Dangling from the
     ceiling. A SERGEANT. Passes them by...

                          SERGEANT
                They say the price's gonna come
                down a lot next year. Kinda cool,
                huh?

                          SPOONER
                How cool will it be when one takes
                your job?

     Spooner.   Pushing past him.   His eyes.   Darting around.

                          CALVIN
                Is everything alright, Detective?

                          SPOONER
                Yeah. This is just how I like my
                robots -- in pieces.

     As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE
     INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them.

                          BALDEZ
                    (to Spooner)
                Can you believe it, man? U.S.
                Robotics. I didn't think I'd ever
                see the inside of this building.

     Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard.   Spooner signs it,
     awkwardly. With his LEFT HAND...

                          SPOONER
                What's the run-down?

                          BALDEZ
                Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four
                years old. Weapon a small caliber
                .22, registered in his name. Looks
                like he walked in, locked the door,
                and snuffed himself.

                                                       12.


Spooner.   Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.

                      SPOONER
            I know someone who disagrees with
            you.

                       BALDEZ
            Who?

Spooner.   Stands.   Pointing down at Hogenmiller.

                       SPOONER
            Him.

And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez.
Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following.

                      SPOONER
            I spoke to a dead man today.   Want
            to tell me about that?

                      CALVIN
            Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his
            appointments. Attended staff
            meetings. He hated corporate life.
            The hologram enabled him to focus
            on his work. It's just a device,
            Detective.

                      SPOONER
            A device that called the police.

                      CALVIN
            The sound of the gunshot would've
            triggered a 911.

                      SPOONER
            But the call came directly to me.

                      CALVIN
            We're talking about a mechanism
            designed by Hogenmiller to say
            provocative things. To irritate
            and confound his colleagues.

                      SPOONER
            And that's what you think it is?

                      CALVIN
            I'm sorry, but this whole
            investigation is the result of a
            dead man's toy messing with your
            head.

                                                       13.


They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls
his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at
him.

                      SPOONER
            When's the last time any of you
            actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I
            mean human to human?

                      CALVIN
            I couldn't say.

                      SPOONER
            Take a guess.

                      CALVIN
            I don't guess, Detective. But if
            pressed, I would reason it had been
            a considerable length of time.

                      SPOONER
            How well did you know him?

Calvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had
been.

                      CALVIN
            Not well. But I admired his work
            tremendously.

Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the
body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.

                      SPOONER
            I get the whole "mad scientist"
            thing. Hogenmiller was past his
            prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He
            enters a room. Locks the door and
            is found minutes later with a
            bullet fired through his mouth into
            his brain. Everything about this
            case says suicide.

                      CALVIN
            You don't sound convinced.

The coroners.   Start loading the body into the box.

                      SPOONER
            Even people who live a life of
            logic and precision rarely arrange
            their deaths so perfectly.
                (turning to her)

                                                             14.


                          SPOONER (cont'd)
                What all this is missing -- is
                personality...

     As he starts for the door...

                          SPOONER
                You have 24 hour surveillance?...

   INT. METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                 

     ...They head out into the hallway.    A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD
     rolling into place behind them.

                          CALVIN
                It's company policy.

                          SPOONER
                I want to see the tapes.

     Calvin. Hurrying to keep up with him. This is hardly how
     she wanted to spend her morning. Calls out into the air...

                          CALVIN
                Victor!

     At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT
     CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two
     small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth
     expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.

                          CALVIN
                Detective, meet Victor. Our
                building's supercomputer. He's the
                checks and balances of U.S.R.
                    (to Victor)
                Victor, Detective Spooner's heading
                up the investigation into the death
                of Dr. Hogenmiller.

     Victor smiles big.   Spooner, furrows his brow.

                          SPOONER
                You look like a very...happy
                computer.

     Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE:

                          VICTOR
                Thank you. That's very kind.

                          CALVIN
                The Detective needs to see our
                security tapes.

                                                                15.


     The elevator doors immediately OPEN.   They step inside.

   INT. ELEVATOR - DAY                                              

     Spooner and Calvin descend. Victor floats on the wall and
     smiles wide. Spooner looks back at it. With a frown.

     The elevator stops, the doors open.    A ROBOT steps on.

                          ROBOT
                Good day, Dr. Calvin.   Good day,
                sir.

     Spooner's jaw. Clenches. Staring at the Robot.       It senses
     the stare. Turns back to him.

                          ROBOT
                May I be of service to you, sir?

     Spooner. Breaks the stare.     Ignoring the Robot.   Calvin.
     Looks over at him.

                          CALVIN
                Aren't you going to answer him?

                          SPOONER
                I don't talk to my refrigerator,
                either.

     Calvin folds her arms.

                          CALVIN
                I get the distinct feeling you're
                one of those people, Detective.

                          SPOONER
                What people?

                          CALVIN
                Those who don't appreciate the work
                we do here at U.S.R.

                          SPOONER
                You people do what you do. Then
                it's up to the rest of us to make
                sense out of the world we wake up
                in.

     As the elevator doors open on to...

                                                           16.


   INT. ATRIUM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                              

     A soaring lobby. The centerpiece is a five-story STATUE of a
     ROBOT, arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vinci's Study
     of Man. Robot workers more numerous than humans. They are
     sleeker. Finer. More advanced than those in the outside
     world.

     Calvin and Spooner head across.

                          CALVIN
                When this company started we were
                manufacturing three robots a week.
                Now look at us. Today's children
                will never know a world without
                robots.

                          SPOONER
                The streets are filled with
                unemployed humans who aren't
                exactly thrilled with that idea.

                          CALVIN
                Our robotic systems maintain
                factory inventories, regulate
                street traffic -- even run the
                family home.

                          SPOONER
                Leaving people to do what, Doctor?

                          CALVIN
                Leaving people to engage in higher
                pursuits that make life worth
                living.

                          SPOONER
                And what happens when something
                goes wrong?

                          CALVIN
                Our system's never wrong.

     As they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet WHIR of
     robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass.

   INT. MAINFRAME - DAY                                        

     Spooner and Calvin enter the MAINFRAME of U.S. Robotics.
     This is the nerve center of the whole operation. Walls lined
     with COMPUTERS, SCREENS, and thousands of CONTROLS.

                                                       17.


                     CALVIN
           This is Victor's home.

VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive-
like components.

                     VICTOR
           I will now play you the last thirty-
           two seconds of Dr. Hogenmiller's
           life.

AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS. The elevator opens and DOCTOR
HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor. In countless
ANGLES. High, low, close-up, wide. Hogenmiller's face
composed but tight.

Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him.   Hogenmiller
steps in. The doors slide closed behind him.

Nothing for a few moments. Then a muffled GUNSHOT. Calvin
jumps, startled. That's it. The cameras, still trained on
the corridor.

                     SPOONER
           Where's the tape from inside?

                     VICTOR
           Dr. Hogenmiller did not permit
           cameras to observe him while
           working.

                     CALVIN
           That was only within the last year.

                     SPOONER
           So we can throw paranoia into the
           mix.
               (to Victor)
           Fast-forward.

A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD. POLICE OFFICERS
appear and force open the doors. Now TECHNICIANS appear
and rush through in a blur...

                      CALVIN
           Um.   I hate to be a stickler...

On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab.

                     CALVIN
           But don't killers usually have to
           enter and exit the scene of a
           crime?

                                                            18.


                          SPOONER
                Stop the recording.

     Spooner turns away from the footage.   Stares at Calvin.

                          SPOONER
                They do, Doctor. Unless they've
                always been there -- and never
                left.

     Calvin looks at him.   Trying to understand.

                          CALVIN
                You think the murderer was in the
                lab the entire time?

                          SPOONER
                If I'm right, it's still there...

     Spooner turns back to the screens. The IMAGE paused at the
     exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab
     door.

                          SPOONER
                We just locked it in.

   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                                    

     The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG.    The
     laboratory doors slide open.

   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                 

     Spooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police
     and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs.
     Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal.

     The LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into
     his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts.

                          CALVIN
                A robot cannot harm a human being,
                Detective. The First Law of
                Robotics forbids it. And we hard-
                wire the Three Laws into every
                model. Without exception.

                          SPOONER
                Yeah, I saw the commercial.

     Spooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting.
     To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a
     METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life.

                                                         19.


Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the
corridors. Clamps his hand down on it.

                     SPOONER
           And if a robot was given a direct
           order to kill?

                     CALVIN
           The Second Law of Robotics would
           prevent it. A robot must obey an
           order only if it does not conflict
           with the first law.

Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs.
Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.

                     SPOONER
           But a robot can defend itself.

                     CALVIN
           Only when that action doesn't
           conflict with the First or Second
           Laws. This is the Third Law of
           Robotics.

                     SPOONER
           Yeah, well, you know what they say
           -- Laws are made to be broken.

                     CALVIN
           Not these laws.

Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   Calvin,
growing impatient...

                     CALVIN
           You're not hearing me, Detective.
           There's nothing here...

WHEN SUDDENLY

The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A
ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!...

Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the
floor...right to...

CALVIN'S FEET.

                     SPOONER
           Dr. Calvin!

Calvin. Stunned.    Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his
ILLUMINATED EYES.   Right on her. She steps forward...

                                                           20.


                     SPOONER
           Goddammit! Stay back!

Spooner. Scrambling towards his gun.     Calvin.    Reaching out
towards the Robot...

                     CALVIN
           Calm down, Detective.     There is no
           danger here...

Spooner.   Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...

                     CALVIN
               (to Robot)
           De-Activate.

And the Robot.   Suddenly FREEZES.

Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet.         Training the
gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him.

                     CALVIN
           How did you know it was under
           there?

                     SPOONER
           If I was metal and didn't want
           anyone to find me, I'd hide under a
           pile of junk.

                     CALVIN
           This Robot wasn't hiding. What
           you're looking at is the result of
           clever programming. The illusion
           of self-interest and free will.
           Nothing more.

Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously.
Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door.

                     CALVIN
           I'm going to go get Dr. Lanning...

...THE ROBOT'S HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUT...grabbing Spooner's
gun...from his holster...LIGHTENING FAST...pointing it...
right back at him...

CLOSE ON Calvin.   Cannot believe this is happening...

                     CALVIN
           I said De-Activate!

                                                         21.


                     SPOONER
           Move away from the door, Doctor.

Calvin's voice.   Cracking from desperation.    Confusion.

                     CALVIN
           Commence emergency shut-down!

                      SPOONER
           Now!

Spooner. Staring into the Robot's eyes. A thin bead of
SWEAT. Trickling down his temple. Calvin. Moving away from
the door...

                     CALVIN
           I...I gave you an order...

The Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun.
Shaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He
touches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot
steps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the
doors begin to shut...

Spooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN.     From an
ankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.

                     CALVIN
           This is impossible.   A robot...

                     SPOONER
           ...can't do that.    Yeah, yeah, I
           know.

                     CALVIN
           My God -- did you see how it moved?
           I've never seen an NS-2 move that
           way...

Starts running for the door.

                    CALVIN
           Wait! Please, you can't destroy
           it. We have to study it...

                     SPOONER
           That thing took my gun. You'll be
           lucky if you get a handful of bolts
           back!

SLAMS the wall panel and...

                                                               22.


   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                  

     ...sprints out into the hallway.     The Robot Suspect.   About
     to turn to corner...

     VICTOR.   Suddenly appearing.

                           VICTOR
                 The suspect is nearing the end of
                 the hallway, Detective.

                           SPOONER
                 Gee, thanks.

     Spooner raises his gun and FIRES...Pegging the robot in the
     LEG...It starts jerking wildly...He takes aim again when...

     CALVIN.   Races out into the hallway.

                           SPOONER
                 Get back to the lab!

     She heads for the Robot.

                           CALVIN
                     (to Robot)
                 You're malfunctioning.   Let me help
                 you!

     The Robot turns. To look at her. GUN pointing to the floor.
     Spooner. FOCUSING in on his HAND. AS ONE FINGER TWITCHES...

     And he DIVES for Calvin. Forcing her to the floor as the
     Robot FIRES. Again and again. Bullets. RICOCHETTING around
     them. SPARKING against the walls...

     The ELEVATOR opens.   The Robot, leaping inside.

     Spooner. On top of Calvin. Looks down at her.        Her HANDS.
     Clutching his coat. Trembling.

                           SPOONER
                 That was a pretty convincing
                 illusion of getting shot at.

                                                CUT TO:

   INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS                                        

     The ROBOT SUSPECT standing inside the elevator. Looks down
     at the bullet hole blown through its leg. Reaches down.
     Metal fingers touching the damage. As if curious. Afraid.

                                                              23.


     Looks back at the other ROBOT. Standing in the back of
     elevator. A primitive model. No reaction. Face, blank.

                                               CUT BACK TO:

   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                

     Spooner springing to his feet.   Helping Calvin up.

                          VICTOR
                I took the liberty of alerting
                Security .003 Seconds after the
                first shot was fired...

                          SPOONER
                Where's that elevator going?

                          VICTOR
                Sub Level 5.

     Spooner SLAMS against a nearby DOOR.   Hurtling down the
     STAIRS...

   INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                                         

     A PHALANX of SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Crossing the lobby.
     PIERCING ALARM BELLS, RINGING...

   INT. ANOTHER METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                         

     More SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Pouring into a HALLWAY...

   INT. STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      

     Spooner and Calvin. Racing down the stairs.     Victor's face
     meeting them at every landing.

                          VICTOR
                I have directed a security team to
                meet the elevator containing the
                errant robot...

     Spooner. Whipping past him. Calvin.      Barely keeping up.
     Not used to this much activity.

     Spooner.   BURSTS through a door and out into...

   INT. SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL 5 - CONTINUOUS                          

     ...Subterranean Level 5. A labyrinth of metal and concrete.
     IN THE DISTANCE. A troupe of SECURITY PERSONNEL swarms
     around a closed ELEVATOR DOOR...

                                                          24.


                     VICTOR
           The suspect is about to be
           apprehended, Detective.

                     SPOONER
           I'll believe it when I see it.

Spooner. Cocking his gun.   A soft DING!    Announcing the
elevator car's arrival.

SECURITY, all crouching down in unison.    Weapons brought
round to position.

Spooner. Weaving through them.   Gun pointed at the metal
doors as...

WHOOSH. They slide open. Revealing a ROBOT. Standing
under the LIGHT. Holding a GUN. It steps out as Security
takes aim and...

                     SPOONER
           Wait!

Spooner pushes past them to the Robot.    Looks down at its
leg. UNSCATHED.

                     SPOONER
           This is not the same robot!

Looking wildly around. Goddammit. Bounds towards an EXIT as
Calvin steps forward to question the robot.

                     CALVIN
               (to Robot)
           What happened to the robot that
           ordered you to hold this firearm?

                     ELEVATOR ROBOT
           This unit is not programmed to obey
           an order given by a robot...

                     CALVIN
           But who gave you this gun?

SPOONER. Running towards the exit.    Hears the answer.
Echoing behind him...

                     ELEVATOR ROBOT
           A metal man.

                                                              25.


   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DAY                                       

     BAM! He BURSTS out into the PLAZA in front of U.S. Robotics.
     Squinting into the light. Then PLUNGING into the crowd...

     HUMAN...ROBOT...HUMAN...ROBOT...they all look the same from
     behind. Spooner running. Through the sea of MAN and
     MACHINE. When someone. Starts to SCREAM. At the sight of
     his GUN. The crowd begins SCATTERING. Chaos. Spooner
     stops. Near a fountain. Turning 360. Looking everywhere...

     The Robot.   Gone.

                            SPOONER (V.O.)
                  ...I want a homicide unit on every
                  street, sidewalk, alley...

   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY                         

     Spooner, standing in front of an assemblage of COPS. Behind
     him, an image of the Robot Suspect plays on the screen...

                            SPOONER
                  ...junkyard, scrapyard, and salvage
                  yard, anywhere it could hide.

     Behind him, flashing images of the city STREETS and DUMPS...

                            SPOONER
                  It's got a bullet hole above the
                  right knee, so be on the look-out
                  for any malfunctioning NS-2...

     Lieutenant Bergin enters the back of the room.     Next to him,
     ASSISTANT D.A. TOLLER. Not looking happy.

                            SPOONER
                  Check out all retail outlets and
                  repair shops, especially the
                  underground ones...

     The screen behind him compartmentalises, showing various
     dubious SHOP FRONTS...

                            SPOONER
                  I don't care who you have to get
                  past to get this done. Just get it
                  done.

     The Cops, begin dispersing. As Bergin catches Spooner's eye.
     Spooner, not pleased to see Toller. Heads over...

                                                         26.


                     TOLLER
           Looking like shit, Spooner.

                     SPOONER
           Well I'm not the one always giving
           Press Conferences...

Bergin puts a hand on Spooner's arm.   Knows he's not going to
like this.

                     LT. BERGIN
           Del, we're going to have to
           reclassify the search. D.A.'s
           office is seeing this NS-2 as
           "missing evidence" -- not a
           homicide suspect.

                      SPOONER
           What?

                     TOLLER
           Homicide is the murder of a human
           being by another human being.
           Therefore, a robot cannot be
           charged with "homicide."

                     SPOONER
           This isn't just any robot...

                     TOLLER
           It's malfunctioning.

                     SPOONER
           It killed someone. That
           registering with you?

Spooner.   Shakes off Bergin's arm.   Eyeballs Toller.

                     SPOONER
           How many shares of U.S.R. you
           holding in your portfolio, Toller?

                     TOLLER
           This is a public safety issue.

                     SPOONER
           That's convenient.

                     TOLLER
           You have any idea what would happen
           to this city if we went running
           around screaming "killer robot?"
           It would collapse in on itself.

                                                                 27.


                            TOLLER (cont'd)
                  Wide-spread panic. Until that NS-
                  2's found we're cooperating with
                  U.S. Robotics and keeping this
                  investigation under wraps.

                            LT. BERGIN
                  Maybe this isn't the case for you,
                  Del.

     Incensed, Spooner replies a little louder than he intended.

                              SPOONER
                  I'm fine!

     Rakes his hand through his hair. Turns to see the other
     COPS, looking over at him. Toller smirks. Looks to Bergin.

                            TOLLER
                  I want updated reports every half
                  hour.

     Heads off.    Spooner.   Watching him.

                            SPOONER
                  This is it, you know. From now on
                  we're going to miss the good old
                  days.

                            LT. BERGIN
                  Good old days?

                            SPOONER
                  When people were killed by other
                  people.

   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CITY STREET - DUSK                      

     Spooner. Rolling along in his car.       Eyes, bloodshot.
     Peering out the window:

     An NS-2 model ROBOT laden with shopping bags, following its
     owner down the sidewalk...

     Another ROBOT, opening the door at a hotel for GUESTS...

     A couple HAULING ROBOTS, loading heavy boxes onto the back of
     a truck...

     Spooner.     Rubs his eyes.   Turns a corner and spots:

     A ROBOT REPAIR SHOP.

                                                           28.


     The latest models in the window. Shiny. Streamlined.
     Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the
     service entrance.

     He stops the car.

   INT. TAXI (MOVING) - ESTATE STREETS - NIGHT                 

     Calvin riding in the back of a DRIVERLESS taxi cab. Staring
     out the window, lost in thought. The cab pulls up to a curb.

                           TAXI VOICE
                 We have arrived at your
                 destination.

     Calvin.   Takes a beat.   Then swipes her card.

   EXT. CALVIN'S CONDO ESTATE - NIGHT                          

     Elegant condos set on prime real estate. Calvin heads down a
     tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance.

                           SPOONER (O.S.)
                 One of my bullets hit your robot...

     Startled. She drops her key card. As Spooner steps out from
     behind a tree. The tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.

                           CALVIN
                 Detective!...

                           SPOONER
                 And I think it's smart enough to
                 repair itself -- don't you?

                           CALVIN
                     (studying him)
                 Yes. I think so.

                           SPOONER
                 Where?

                           CALVIN
                 Any repair shop...

                           SPOONER
                 No. It's always the owner who
                 brings the robot in for repair.
                 Where would a robot without an
                 owner go?

                                                          29.


                      CALVIN
            I'm not sure what you're getting
            at.

                      SPOONER
                (stepping closer)
            Does U.S. Robotics have a factory
            in the city limits?

Calvin.   Tucking her hair behind her ears.

                      CALVIN
            The locations of our factories are
            classified.

                      SPOONER
            I don't care.

Calvin.   Looks up at him.   A Mexican stand-off.

                      CALVIN
            I have several conditions if I show
            you.

                      SPOONER
            I expected that.

                      CALVIN
            First. I want it brought in
            unharmed.

                      SPOONER
                (doesn't like it, but)
            Agreed.

                       CALVIN
            Second.   I want to talk to it,
            alone.

                      SPOONER
            Too dangerous.

                      CALVIN
            This model violated the Three Laws.
            It also moved and reacted
            differently than any robot I've
            ever seen. There must be some sort
            of logical explanation. I want to
            find out what that is. No police.
            No prosecutors. No you. Just me
            and the robot.

Spooner, looks down at this small woman.      Narrows his eyes.

                                                           30.


                          SPOONER
                When they told me you were a
                psychologist, that wasn't the whole
                truth, was it?

                          CALVIN
                I never said I treated human
                beings.

   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT   

     Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16-
     lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS
     stretches forever in either direction.

     A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with
     TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to
     manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head.

                          CALVIN
                That should be outlawed once and
                for all.

                          SPOONER
                That'll be the day I stop driving.

     Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR.
     Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale.

                          CALVIN
                I can recommend a behavior
                modification program, you know --
                if you want to overcome your robo-
                phobia.

                          SPOONER
                I'm not afraid of robots.   I just
                don't like them.

                          CALVIN
                Why? Because they make every
                aspect of our lives more
                convenient?

                          SPOONER
                Exactly. They do our dirty work.
                Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets
                pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody
                can do someone else's dirty work
                without coming to hate them. I
                don't want to be around when your
                robots decide they've taken their
                last order.

                                                              31.


                          CALVIN
                That day will never come,
                Detective. Robots aren't like
                human beings -- they don't question
                their existence.

     Spooner cranks the gear shift.    Throwing her a look.

                          SPOONER
                Spoken like a true robo-phile.

   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - NIGHT                               

     The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.

     Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade
     of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too
     high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.

   EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT                                         

     Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R.
     ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly,
     the gate begins to open.

   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                           

     A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway.    Shaking his head.

                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                Head-Office already ordered a
                system-wide inventory check. Don't
                know about a missing NS-2...

     Looks back at Spooner.

                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                What'd you say you did?

                          SPOONER
                Research and Development.

     As Spooner pushes past him into...

   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS                                

     ...the Control Booth. Overlooking the pristine Factory
     Floor. The Foreman starts working the controls of a central
     computer.

                          CALVIN
                All Nestors accounted for?

                                                                32.


     The SCREEN scrolls with INVENTORY FIGURES.

                           NIGHT FOREMAN
                     (gesturing)
                 As you can see, all properly
                 catalogued. Your robot just isn't
                 here.

     Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't
     there. She looks around. Then sees the Foreman reacting.
     Looks out the window at...

     SPOONER.   Walking out onto the factory floor.

   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       

     Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT. Lined with NS-
     2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room.

     Calvin and the Foreman.   Catching up.   Over the noise:

                           NIGHT FOREMAN
                 Like I said, sir -- we have one
                 hundred fully assembled NS-2s
                 housed here. That's our capacity.
                 Last week we had one hundred.
                 Yesterday we had one hundred --

     Spooner, slowing.   Finally spotting what he was looking for.
     Points at:

     A GAP.   On the assembly belt.    ONE LEG MISSING.

                           SPOONER
                 Well today you have one-hundred and
                 one.

   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       

     A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight
     formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. The
     sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as
     101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.

     Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all
     look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands.

                           SPOONER
                     (to Calvin)
                 You're the robot shrink.

     The Robots stand motionless.     A strange tableau.   Calvin.
     Takes a step forward.

                                                          33.


                     CALVIN
           There is a robot in this formation
           that does not belong. Identify it.

101 robots answer in unison.    Their mechanical VOICES
resounding:

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     CALVIN
           Which one?

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     CALVIN
           That is not a satisfactory answer!

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     SPOONER
           That's helpful.

                     CALVIN
           I could always interview each one
           individually and cross-reference
           their responses to detect any
           anomalies.

                     SPOONER
           How long would that take?

                     CALVIN
           About three weeks.

They share a look. Clearly not an option.      Then.   Calvin.
Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner...

                      CALVIN
           Or...

...and GRABS his GUN from his holster.   He jumps back.

                     CALVIN
           We have one hundred robots here
           that cannot allow a human being to
           come to harm...

Their eyes lock.   Spooner, getting what she's doing.

                                                           34.


                       SPOONER
             And one that can.

She raises the gun to Spooner's head.    Hand, unsteady.

                       CALVIN
             Am I holding this right?

                       SPOONER
             More or less.

Calvin.    Swallows.   Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the
gun...

AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of
linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING.
Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...

When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in
unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.

Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.
Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.

Spooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin...

                       SPOONER
             Enough game-playing.

...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its
body crumples to the ground.

                       SPOONER
             Guess that wasn't it.

Calvin. Cannot believe what he just did.     Rushes over to the
destroyed Robot.

                       CALVIN
             What are you doing?!

Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.

                       SPOONER
                 (calling out)
             This is a self-preservation field
             test! DO NOT attempt to save
             yourselves. Any of you. That's an
             order!

FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the
P.A.:

                                                             35.


                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                Are you crazy? Those are eight
                hundred thousand dollar machines!

     Spooner randomly stops at another Robot.    Raises his gun.

                          SPOONER
                You hear that? You're worth more
                than I'll make in my entire life...

     His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly
     grabs his arm.

                          CALVIN
                You can't just destroy them!

     Spooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something
     catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost.
     Imperceptible.

     He jerks his head.   Locking eyes with a ROBOT.   A couple feet
     away. It's him!

                          SPOONER
                Gotcha.

     The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING
     of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he
     swings himself up...

     Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the
     Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with
     a terrific CRASH...

   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT                                    

     Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding
     under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The
     door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.

     Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin.
     Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her
     hand.

                          SPOONER
                You don't know what's going to
                happen in there.

     As if admitting defeat. Calvin's fingers, wrapping around
     the gun. As Spooner leads them to the door and down into...

                                                             36.


   INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               

     ...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a
     great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes
     holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening
     ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes
     METAL BODIES...

     Spooner.   Motioning Calvin to stay behind him.   As they
     descend.   Into the cavernous room.

     And enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them.
     Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat
     from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself...

     When the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of
     ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them
     off from one another...

     Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of
     the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart.
     Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears...

     He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down.
     Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line.
     Appears before him...

     Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand.
     It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere
     he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...

     He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against
     it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid.
     Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At
     his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar.
     SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner.
     Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the
     line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it.
     Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...

     Then turns.   Disappearing.

     Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles
     to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears
     a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the
     Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With
     his metal fists...

     Spooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row.
     When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round.

                                                                 37.


     To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm.     And forces them
     through a line...

     EMERGING into the open. The ROBOT. Still pounding.
     Desperate. Like a trapped animal...

                          CALVIN
                Now what do we do?

                          SPOONER
                I've already done it.

     And suddenly, the massive SECURITY DOOR RISES...

   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - CONTINUOUS                             

     The Robot Suspect takes its chance.     Runs full out.   STOPS.

     Bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of POLICE CARS.
     UNIFORMED OFFICERS are aiming SPECIALISED RIFLES at the
     Robot. FLASHING LIGHTS reflecting off its metal surface.

     The Robot turns to Spooner.     Extends its hands.   Palms out.

                          ROBOT
                WHAT AM I?

     Spooner is surprised. A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED
     NETTING shooting out at Sonny. A SECOND OFFICER fires and a
     second net covers him. Then a THIRD...

     ...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.

     Calvin glares at Spooner.    Furious.   Hurt.   Betrayed.

                          CALVIN
                We had a deal.

     But Spooner doesn't look at her.    His eyes are locked on that
     Robot.

   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - EARLY MORNING                  

     Bergin enters.   Finds EVERYONE focused on the VIDEO WALL:

     ON SCREEN. A NEWS REPORTER is speaking over images of street
     violence perpetrated against ROBOTS.

                          NEWS REPORTER
                Violence erupted last night in
                response to unconfirmed reports
                that Dr. Heinrich Hogenmiller, a
                top employee at U.S.

                                                               38.


                          NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)
                Robotics, was killed yesterday
                morning by a robot. While there
                has been no official response from
                the company, police sources have
                confirmed that a robot is being
                held as "evidence..."

     Bergin grimaces.   This is not good.

   INT. CELL OBSERVATION BOOTH - EARLY MORNING                     

     Spooner stares at his reflection in a large MIRROR.     Touches
     a control and the mirror becomes a WINDOW onto...

     A HOLDING CELL. The Robot Suspect sits at the table.
     Shackled to the chair. Staring at the table top.

     BERGIN steps up beside Spooner.   Looks through the glass.

                          LT. BERGIN
                I can't tell if it's not moving
                because it's trying to psych us
                out, or because it's just a
                machine. Or both.

                          SPOONER
                I want to go in.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Orders are nobody steps into that
                room `til Lanning and his attorneys
                get here.

     Spooner.   Throws him a look.   Bergin, his loyalties torn.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Five minutes.

   INT. HOLDING CELL - EARLY MORNING                               

     Spooner enters. Pulls out a chair and drags it far from the
     table. He's been jumped too many times by this machine.

     Four mounted cameras WHIR to life.     The Robot.   Perfectly
     still.

                          SPOONER
                    (sitting)
                Identify.

     The Robot tilts its head with a muted WHIR.     As if it doesn't
     understand him. Spooner. Disdainful.

                                                        39.


                       SPOONER
             You are an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
             Your primary function is to perform
             the tasks assigned to you.
             Identify.

                       THE ROBOT
             I am an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
             My primary function --

                       SPOONER
                 (interrupting)
             Cancel. Perform task.

Spooner wings a FILE onto the table. It comes to a stop near
the Robot. The Robot, lifts one of its hands. Gently
resting its metal fingers on top of the file. Then opens it.

A stack of PICTURES.     HOGENMILLER'S CORPSE.

                         SPOONER
             Describe.

The Robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.

                       SPOONER
             You have over 10,000 words stored
             in your memory. One third of those
             are adjectives. Describe.

Nothing.

                       SPOONER
             Why don't I take a crack? Heinrich
             Hogenmiller, your creator. With a
             bullet in his brain. A bullet you
             put there.

The Robot.   Looks up at Spooner.

                       SPOONER
             Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new
             trick for a robot, don't you think?
             Answer.

The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across
the table. Spooner. Crosses his arms.

                       SPOONER
             Maybe you're stonewalling me.
             Maybe you're sitting there right
             now thinking, "This guy's a
             complete asshole." That it?

                                                      40.


Still nothing.

                      SPOONER
           Come on.   Am I right?

                     THE ROBOT
           Yes. You are right.      You are a
           complete asshole.

And for a moment, Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his
eyes. He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile.

                     SPOONER
           Okay. I guess that's a start. Now
           maybe you can tell me what you were
           doing hiding five feet away from
           Hogenmiller's corpse?

                     THE ROBOT
           I was frightened.

                     SPOONER
           Frightened. Why do you suppose Dr.
           Hogenmiller would create a robot
           that could simulate fear?

                     THE ROBOT
           I don't know.

                     SPOONER
           Doesn't seem like a very useful
           thing for a robot to have.

                     THE ROBOT
           I don't know why.

                     SPOONER
           I wouldn't want my toaster to be
           frightened. Or my vacuum cleaner --

SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table.

                     THE ROBOT
           I DON'T KNOW!

Spooner flinches.   Slightly.

                     SPOONER
           Looks like you can simulate other
           emotional states. I think that
           one's called "anger." Have you
           ever simulated anger before?

                                                         41.


The Robot doesn't respond.

                     SPOONER
           Answer me, robot.

                     THE ROBOT
           My name is Sonny.

                     SPOONER
               (amused)
           So we're naming you now.

                     SONNY
           Dr. Hogenmiller would make me
           sleep.

                     SPOONER
           You mean he'd turn you off.

                       SONNY
           Yes.

                     SPOONER
           And you didn't like being turned
           off. So one day you decided to
           stop him.

                       SONNY
           No.

                     SPOONER
           You found his gun, pointed it at
           his head. And pulled the trigger.

Sonny shakes his head.    Faster and faster.   Getting upset.

                       SONNY
           No.

                     SPOONER
           You put a bullet in the brain of
           the man who made you.

                       SONNY
           No!    I could never hurt anyone!

                     SPOONER
           But you tried to hurt me.    You took
           a shot at me.

                     SONNY
           My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted
           to hit you, I would have.

                                                              42.


     Spooner's expression hardens.

                          SPOONER
                Why would the man who wrote the
                Laws of Robotics build a machine
                that violates them?

                          SONNY
                The Laws say I can protect my own
                existence.

                          SPOONER
                Only if that protection doesn't
                harm a human being.

     A short pause.   Sonny.   Tilts his head.

                          SONNY
                That doesn't seem fair, does it?

     Spooner. Stares at him. Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
     Bergin enters. Sticks his head in.

                          LT. BERGIN
                I need you outside.

     Spooner.   Not wanting to go.   Not wanting to stay.   Gets
     up...

                          SONNY
                Detective.

     He stops. Turns back to the Robot.      It looks up at him.    For
     a moment -- so human...

                          SONNY
                I did not kill him.

                          SPOONER
                You were the only one in the room.
                If you didn't, who did?

     He turns and heads out the door.

   INT. OUTSIDE HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                          

     Bergin closes the door.   To Spooner:

                          LT. BERGIN
                We're being blind-sided.

                                                             43.


   INT. HOMICIDE UNIT HEARING ROOM - MORNING                     

     Spooner and Bergin, head into a small COURTROOM off the main
     squad room. Lanning is huddled with Aronson and a half-dozen
     other COMPANY LAWYERS.

     Spooner's jaw tenses. As he watches Toller emerge from the
     clutch. Shaking hands. Slapping backs. Strolls over to
     them.

                            TOLLER
                  We got Judge Drexel...

                            ROBOT BAILIFF
                  This hearing is called to order!

     AS A LARGE SCREEN. BLIPS on behind them. The two opposing
     sides, assemble before it. JUDGE DREXEL, still in his
     pajamas and robe. An NS-2 ROBOT. Leaning in to serve him a
     cup of tea.

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  Statements, gentlemen.

     Aronson.    Standing at a glass podium.

                            ARONSON
                  Your Honor, the State is treating
                  the robot as a defendant. But in
                  fact it is a piece of property.
                  Property belonging to U.S.
                  Robotics.

     Toller.    Arm resting on his podium.

                            TOLLER
                  This robot has been implicated in
                  the death of a human being, Your
                  Honor.

                            ARONSON
                  Which places the incident firmly
                  within the realm of an industrial
                  accident. Or is the State going to
                  argue this case s a homicide?

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  That's a good question.

                             TOLLER
                  No, sir.   Of course not.

     Spooner.    Pointing a finger at the U.S. Robotics group.

                                                           44.


                       SPOONER
             Their machine shot and killed a
             man!

Toller.    Shoots him a look.     Just as Lanning speaks up.

                       LANNING
             There's actually no concrete
             evidence that points to that
             conclusion, Your Honor...

Spooner.    Throws up his arms...

                        SPOONER
             What?...

                       LANNING
             But we recognise that this robot is
             an aberration. And in the interest
             of public safety, U.S. Robotics
             proposes that it be destroyed
             immediately.

No one expected this.    Least of all Spooner.    He turns to
Toller.

                       SPOONER
             You can't let them destroy evidence
             in an ongoing investigation!

                       TOLLER
             I'm not sure you even have an
             investigation any more.

JUST THEN the door opens.    Everyone turns as Calvin enters.
Spooner looks surprised.

                       ARONSON
             Your Honor, I'd like to call our
             company robo-psychologist to the
             stand.

                       JUDGE DREXEL
             Very well.

Calvin crosses to the podium. A SPEAKER asking:
Doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth?

                        CALVIN
             I do.

                                                               45.


                            ARONSON
                  Dr. Calvin, please tell us what
                  conclusions you've reached after
                  having observed the robot in
                  action.

                            CALVIN
                  There is a design flaw in the
                  robot. Its programming is
                  advanced, but unstable, leaving the
                  Three Laws in a grave imbalance.

                            ARONSON
                  In your expert opinion, what
                  measures should be taken regarding
                  the device?

     Calvin.    Staring straight ahead.   Avoiding Spooner's eye.

                            CALVIN
                  The robot must be destroyed.

     Spooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak
     up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard.

     Judge Drexel has heard enough.    Decides.

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  The robot in question will be
                  transferred to a U.S. Robotics
                  facility where it can be properly
                  examined to ensure an imbalance of
                  this sort never occurs again. No
                  one goes near it except qualified
                  U.S.R. personnel. When the
                  examination is complete, the robot
                  is to be destroyed.

     Starts getting up from his chair.    Already done with this.

                            ROBOT BAILIFF
                  This hearing is adjourned!

     A BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off. The U.S.R.
     camp, looking especially pleased. Spooner. Catching
     Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit,
     his hand on her back.

   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - DAY                                          

     Spooner.    Trotting down the front steps of the Police
     Station.    Pissed. His cell phone BLEATS...

                                                            46.


                           SPOONER
                     (answering)
                 Spooner.

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 They're making me turn over all the
                 evidence...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

   INT. CRIME LAB - CONTINUOUS                                  

     BALDEZ. Standing in his crime lab. Behind him, THREE-
     DIMENSIONAL PROJECTIONS of DEAD BODIES. Hovering in the
     precise positions they were found.

                           SPOONER'S VOICE
                 Welcome to the great American cover-
                 up.

                           BALDEZ
                 I wanted to tell you something I
                 found before they suck it all up
                 into their computer.

     Walks over to the projection of HOGENMILLER'S BODY.

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

     Spooner. Crossing the Plaza. Sees LANNING, ARONSON, and
     CALVIN walking ahead of him...

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 There are bruises on Hogenmiller's
                 wrists...

                           SPOONER
                 That's natural. There was a
                 struggle.

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 You're not getting me...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

     Baldez.   Studying the projection's wrists.

                           BALDEZ
                 Both wrists. I 14-ed them -- They
                 were inflicted at the same time the
                 shot was fired...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

                                                                47.


     Spooner's pace.    Slows.

                            BALDEZ' VOICE
                  How's that possible?

     JUST THEN.    A faint BLIP.   On the line.   Spooner.   Reacts.

                             SPOONER
                  Baldez?

                            BALDEZ' VOICE
                  I'm here, man...

                            SPOONER
                  Who else is on the line?
                      (nothing)
                  I said who's there?...

     Nothing. He looks up. Aronson, Lanning and Calvin. Heading
     down a plaza EXIT. Aronson. Throwing a look over his
     shoulder.

     Spooner.     Hangs up his phone.

   INT. POLICE H.Q. - CORRIDOR - DAY                                 

     CLOSE ON Sonny being escorted down a corridor by Toller,
     Bergin and a number of heavily-armed OFFICERS. He's bound
     with high-tech SHACKLES.

   INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - DAY                                   

     Sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into
     an underground car park. Spooner. Waiting for them. Heads
     over. Toller. Holds out his hand.

                            TOLLER
                  Case is closed, Spooner.

                            SPOONER
                  Apparently...

     He pushes past him.     Falling into step beside Sonny.

                            SONNY
                  I didn't expect to see you again,
                  Detective...

                            SPOONER
                  I need you to help me clear
                  something up.

                                                        48.


                     SONNY
           I'll do my best.

                     SPOONER
           A scientist builds a robot that
           acts like a man. More like a man
           than any robot ever before. It
           shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls
           it a failure.

                     SONNY
           What would you call it?

                     SPOONER
           A stunning success.
               (beat)
           You were there, Robot.    What am I
           missing?

                     SONNY
           I don't know.

                     SPOONER
           Don't start simulating ignorance.

                     SONNY
           I'm not simulating ignorance,
           Detective. I'm experiencing it.       I
           was asleep.

                     SPOONER
           You mean you were shut down.

                     SONNY
           No, I was asleep.

                     SPOONER
           Robots don't sleep. Human beings
           sleep. Understand? Dogs sleep.
           You're a machine. An imitation.
           An illusion of life. Can a robot
           write a symphony? Can a robot take
           a blank canvas and paint a
           masterpiece?

A pause.   Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him.

                     SONNY
           Can you do either of those things?

Spooner. Momentarily stumped. As a VAN from U.S. ROBOTICS
pulls up. The back door dropping open. An ENGINEER motions
to the Robot.

                                                       49.


                     ENGINEER
           Step forward. Enter.

                     SONNY
           They're going to destroy me, aren't
           they?

Spooner.   Watching him step into the van.

                      SPOONER
           Yes.

Sonny sits down. With an almost human melancholy.   The
Engineers, securing him in place.

                     SONNY
           The Doctor was right. He told me
           everything was going to change....

The Engineers start to close the doors. But Spooner reaches
out to stop them. Sonny. Looks over at him.

                     SONNY
           It's changing already...
               (beat)
           Can't you feel it?

As CLANG! The van door CLOSES. Spooner, stepping back.
Something. Just not right. Lieutenant Bergin comes up
beside him.

                     LT. BERGIN
           You should be happy. That's one
           less robot in the world.

                     SPOONER
           They're going to destroy the most
           advanced robot in the world, John.
           That doesn't strike you as odd?

                     LT. BERGIN
           Killer robots are bad for business.
           Even your friend Dr. Calvin said
           so.
               (slaps him on the back)
           Come on. You solved the case.
           Give yourself a break.

Spooner looks at him.   There's no way he's giving himself a
break.

                                                             50.


   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - DAY                                 

     Spooner driving. A small TELEVISION above the windshield.
     LANCE ROBERTSON holding a PRESS CONFERENCE outside U.S.
     Robotics...

                          ROBERTSON ON TV
                ...and I just want to assure you that
                this was an isolated incident. The
                prototype is now in custody -- and
                scheduled for destruction. Your
                robots are perfectly safe. There
                is no cause for alarm...

     Spooner's lip curls. Eyes flicking to a GPS display on the
     dashboard. A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP pinpointing HOGENMILLER'S
     HOUSE. The CURSOR. Directing him to turn up...

     A STEEP DRIVEWAY

     Narrow. Out of the way. Spooner's brow furrows.     As he
     hears a faraway RUMBLING SOUND...

   EXT. HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY                                

     Dr. Hogenmiller's house. Small. Simple. Built on a huge
     rock promontory overlooking the city. Three DEMOLITION
     ROBOTS rolling towards it. Huge, mashing, sporting massive
     HYDRAULIC POUNDERS.

     Spooner's CAR. SCREECHES to a stop. He jumps out. Races
     over to the nearest machine. Looking around -- no people.

                          SPOONER
                    (to Robot)
                What are you doing?!

     A SCREEN. Blinks to life on the hulking chassis.    A
     disembodied VOICE...

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                Demolition ordered...

                          SPOONER
                Who authorised this?

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                Demolition ordered...

     Spooner reaches into his coat.    Pulling out his POLICE BADGE.
     Scans it over the screen.

                                                                51.


                          SPOONER
                Override. This is police business.
                Vacate the premises immediately.

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                    (beat)
                Affirmative.

     The screen. Blinks off.     Spooner.   Eyeing it.   Turns and
     heads for the house.

   INT. MAIN ROOM - HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY                       

     Spooner pushes the door open. Stepping over the police tape.
     Inside, the main room is spare, untidy. Cups of cold COFFEE,
     littering surfaces. A COT, in the corner.

     On the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES. Heinrich Hogenmiller's
     name written out in academic script. Advanced Degrees in the
     study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics. An
     AWARD on the mantelpiece. A silver NS-2. Tarnished.

     Spooner. Opening up a couple drawers of a side table.
     Jumbles of papers. Clippings. Old text books. Then a
     PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN. Standing arm-in-arm.
     Spooner furrows his brow.

     WHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg. He startles.
     Looks down: a CAT. Lonely. Standing next to its automatic
     feeder. Spooner pockets the picture. Starts heading down...

   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        

     ...The hallway. Starts noticing. All over the walls:
     handwriting. EQUATIONS. Scrawled in white pencil. The
     rantings. Of a genius. Glowing. In the sporadic shadows.

     Spooner.   Following the equations.    Down into...

   INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                      

     ...The back room. Covered. In writing. Walls, floors,
     ceiling. Drawings. Of ROBOTS, of MEN, side by side. In the
     corner, a COMPUTER. A line of CABINETS - DATA STORAGE.

     Spooner, curious. Heads over to one of the cabinets. Takes
     a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD.
     The device blinks RED. Then GREEN. The drawer, slides out.

     LINED. With flat metal objects. Shiny. Thin.          With writing
     on them. Spooner. Reaches for one when...

                                                             52.


     BOOM! Something POUNDS the outside of the room.    Spooner.
     Grabs onto the cabinet...

     BOOM! On the other side. Objects. Flying off table-tops.
     A CRACK spidering along the wall. Holy shit...

                          SPOONER
                    (screaming)
                Halt!

     BOOM! VIBRATIONS, tearing through the room.     More CRACKS.
     Spreading...

     BOOM! The SOUND, horrifying. Spooner stumbles back.      The
     CABINET. Crashing down on his leg. He CRIES OUT...

     BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The house. Getting pummeled.        Chunks of
     ceiling. Raining down. GLASS...exploding...

     Relentless BOOMING! Spooner...dragging his legs from under
     the cabinet. Scrambling for purchase as...

     THE FLOOR...begins to tilt...the TILES...snapping
     up...ricocheting...around the room...as another cabinet...
     CRASHES to the ground...crumpling...

     Spooner.   Spinning around.   Looking for some kind of exit...

     BOOM! The corner of the room...coming in on itself...the
     floor...listing even more...like a ship...

     Spooner...turning to CLAW his way up to the cracked
     doorway...WHEN...

     SOMETHING catches his eye. In the bottom drawer. Of a
     crumpled CABINET. One of those flat metal plates. He can
     just read what it says: S.O.N.N.Y....

     Spooner...flings his arm back...reaching for the plate...
     snaps it up...JUST AS...

     BOOM! A HYDRAULIC POUNDER SMASHES through the wall...inches
     from his head...OUTSIDE LIGHT...pouring in...

     Spooner scurries for the doorway...tumbling out...

   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      

     ...into the HALLWAY. Sideways. Trammeled plaster. BOOM!
     Another POUNDER...crashing down from above. Spooner. Timing
     it...rolling...BOOM!...just under the next pounding...

                                                           53.


     Scampering up...towards some LIGHT...BOOM!...the
     POUNDER...right on his heels...he clambers...closer...
     closer...when...he hears...MEOWING...looks back...the
     CAT...scared out of its wits...BOOM!...the POUNDER CRASHING
     in...Spooner...just manages...to scoop up the cat...just as
     BOOM!...

   EXT. DEMOLISHED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                            

     ...He pours them out into the open. The POUNDERS. Going at
     the house like hyenas at a corpse. Roof tiles, beams,
     plaster, flooring. SNAPPING and CRACKING as Spooner and the
     cat skitter down the carnage.

     Heart pounding, breath jagged, face bloodied, Spooner
     scrambles away from the POUNDERS. Their bodies GLEAMING in
     the dusk sun. The III Laws Safe logo, splashed along their
     sides...

     Spooner.   Drops the cat.

   INT. HALLWAY - CALVIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                         

     Spooner. POUNDS on the door. It opens. Calvin. Standing
     there in her bathrobe. Shocked at his appearance.

                          CALVIN
                Detective! What happened to
                you?...

                          SPOONER
                A couple of your beloved robots
                just tried to kill me...

     He pushes past her.   Into...

   INT. CALVIN'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS                              

     ...her condo.   Spartan.    Unadorned.

                         CALVIN
                What? That's impossible.      You
                know...

                          SPOONER
                What I know is a demolition crew
                started tearing down Hogenmiller's
                house while I was still inside it.

                          CALVIN
                Maybe they didn't realise...

                                                         54.


                      SPOONER
            I scanned my badge before I went
            in. They realised.

                      CALVIN
            Then you must have done it wrong...

                      SPOONER
            I don't think you're hearing what
            I'm saying -- they tried to kill
            me.

Spooner moves deeper into the apartment.   Everything.
Automated. Computerised. Cold...

                      SPOONER
            There's something going on, here.
            Some kind of shift.

Calvin laughs.   Can't believe what she's hearing.

                      CALVIN
            Do you know how paranoid you sound?

                      SPOONER
            Great. Now I'm being analysed by a
            robo-psychologist.

                      CALVIN
            You just want to find the flaws in
            the system. You're obsessed with
            it. You'll twist anything to fit
            your agenda.

                      SPOONER
            Like you did in court today? How'd
            that fit your agenda, Doctor?

He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller. Calvin.
Blanching at the sight of it. Spooner tosses it down.

                      SPOONER
            You told me you hardly knew him.
            Want to try the truth this time?

                      CALVIN
            Well, Detective, when you see
            someone you know well put a bullet
            through their brain, it makes you
            wonder if you ever really knew them
            at all.

Calvin.   Looking down at the photo.   Swallows.

                                                         55.

                       CALVIN
                 (difficult for her)
             He was my mentor. No, more than
             that. A genius with an insight far
             beyond anyone in his field.

                       SPOONER
             Doesn't sound like the washed-up
             old fool Robertson described.

                       CALVIN
             But he was starting to withdraw
             from everyone. Even me.
             Maybe...if I'd tried harder to
             reach him...
                 (shakes her head)
             The Doctor was reckless when he
             created a robot potentially not
             bound by the Three Laws. He could
             have ruined everything we'd been
             working for.

Spooner.    Locking eyes with her.

                       SPOONER
             Sounds like a motive for murder to
             me. Just not for the suspect we
             have in custody.

Calvin. Blinks. Trying, to stick to her resolve. Heads
over to the door. Spooner. Looking around the condo.

                       SPOONER
             You know there's not one thing in
             this apartment that looks like a
             human being lives here. No
             evidence of a life outside your
             work. Almost seems like you're
             afraid of people.

Calvin.    Opening the door.

                       CALVIN
             I'm not afraid of people,
             Detective. I just don't like them.

Spooner. Looks at her.     Then heads out the door.   Calvin
SLAMS it behind him...

The SOUND...of the SLAM...REVERBERATING...and we...

                                           FADE INTO:

                                                             56.


   INT. DREAM SEQUENCE - DAY                                      

     ...A DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.

     A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
     Noticeable. ORANGE... YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

     Another SOUND...GLASS...SHATTERING...then a SIREN...
     faraway...

     The disembodied VOICE...coming out of nowhere...

                          DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)
                You are in danger...

     The FIRE...BUILDING...

                          DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)
                You are in danger...

     ECHOING...as...

   INT. SPOONER'S BEDROOM - MORNING                               

     SPOONER'S EYES.   Spring open.

     Lying, in bed. Heart POUNDING. SWEAT. Covering his body.
     LIGHT. Pouring in through the slats of his blinds.

     He sits up. Rubbing his face. Trying. To calm his
     breathing. Takes a look at his watch...

   EXT. MONORAIL STATION - DAY                                    

     Spooner walking along the monorail plaza. Looking a little
     worse for wear. PEOPLE. Giving him wide berth. ROBOTS.
     Bidding him:

                          ROBOT
                Good morning...

     Spooner, shooting them suspicious looks.    As the MONORAIL
     pulls up...

                                                 CUT TO:

   INT. HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - CONTINUOUS                      

     Calvin. Heading down a hallway. A DOOR slides open.      And
     Lanning steps out. Followed by a TECHNICIAN ROBOT...

                          CALVIN
                Find anything, Doctor?

                                                                 57.


                          LANNING
                    (shaking his head)
                Nothing. The interior's just like
                any other NS-2. Except for a
                secondary battery Hogenmiller must
                have used as extra back-up.
                    (looks at watch)
                We'll just need a nominal profile.

     Calvin nods.

                                               CUT BACK TO:

   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                        

     Spooner, holding onto a handrail. As the city rushes by the
     window. Notices a group of ROBOTS. At the other end of the
     car. Are they watching him?

     He wipes a bead of sweat.    From his upper lip.

                                               CUT TO:

   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                    

     An all-metal room. Spare. Anti-septic.     SONNY.   Sitting on
     the floor. Against the wall.

     Calvin enters.   Puts her pad down on the table.    Sits.

                          CALVIN
                Please state your serial number and
                assembly date.

     She pulls out a pen.   Waiting for an answer.   Nothing.

                                               CUT BACK TO:

   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                        

     Spooner. Watching as a HOMELESS MAN.    Comes stumbling
     through the car...

                           CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                Sonny.   I'm speaking to you...

     The Homeless Man.   Suddenly grabs his ears and shouts:

                          HOMELESS MAN
                God, can't you be quiet!

                                               CUT TO:

                                                               58.


   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                  

     Calvin.   Still looking down at her pad.

                           CALVIN
                 How about your data board
                 designation?

     Still. Sonny says nothing. Calvin. Finally looks up at
     him. Is suddenly struck. Something about the way he's
     sitting -- so human.

     She gets up and walks over. Hesitates. Then slides down on
     the floor next to him. Studying. His profile.

                           CALVIN
                 Maybe I'm asking the wrong
                 questions. How about this one:

                                                CUT BACK TO:

   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                      

     The Homeless Man.   Weaving...

                           CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                 ...What program are you running
                 through right now?

                           SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                 I'm not sure. It's nothing I
                 recognise.

     The Homeless Man.   Pointing to the group of ROBOTS.

                           HOMELESS MAN
                     (shouting)
                 Don't you people hear them?
                 They're talking to each other!
                 Buzz, buzz, zip, zip...they never
                 shut up!

   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                  

     Calvin. Fascinated.    Noticing a small SLIT.   At the base of
     Sonny's neck.

                           CALVIN
                 Describe his behavior in the last
                 few weeks.

                                                               59.


                          SONNY
                I'm sorry?

                          CALVIN
                Dr. Hogenmiller. Did he seem
                overly sad or withdrawn to you?

                                                CUT BACK TO:

   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                       

     Spooner watches. As the Homeless Man picks up a SODA CAN and
     hurls it at the Robots. Hitting one of them on the side of
     the head.

                          SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                No. Not at all. But he was
                agitated...

     The Robot. Leans down and picks up the soda can.      Holds it
     back out to the Homeless Man.

                          SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                ...He would claim things were
                missing from the lab.

     The Homeless Man. Incensed.     SUDDENLY ROARS.   Making a rush
     for the Robots when...

     SPOONER'S HAND.    Grabs his shoulder.   Stops him.

                          SPOONER
                This is your stop.

                I didn't pay much attention. He
                would spend hours looking for his
                eyeglasses and they would be...

                          CALVIN
                    (finishing for him)
                ...right on top of his head.

     Sonny nods. She knows him well, too. Calvin swallows.
     Looking right into Sonny's eyes. Feeling like there's
     something...something more behind them.

                                                               60.


     WHEN SUDDENLY...VICTOR APPEARS above them. His face, turning
     into a SCREEN -- the image of LANCE ROBERTSON. Looking down
     at them.

                           ROBERTSON
                 I think we're done here, Susan.

                           CALVIN
                     (getting to her feet)
                 But, sir, I was just...

                           ROBERTSON
                     (interrupting)
                 I said I think we're done.

     Calvin.   Not misreading.   The threatening undertone.

                                               CUT BACK TO:

   EXT. MONORAIL STATION - CONTINUOUS                                

     Spooner stepping out onto the platform, pulling the Homeless
     Man along with him. COMMUTERS pour out around them.

     As the train pulls off with a WHOOSH. The Homeless Man.
     Backs away from Spooner. Grinning insanely. Pointing.

                           HOMELESS MAN
                 Why are you protecting them, man?
                     (short pause)
                 They were talking about you!

     A CHILL. Ripping up Spooner's spine. As he watches the
     Homeless Man. Wander down the platform.

     Tries. To shake off the feeling. As he turns. To wait for
     the next train. Suddenly realising. That he's ALONE on the
     platform. Watches. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK. Ticking off
     seconds. Sees. CAMERAS in every corner.

     Then that feeling. At the back of his neck. He turns and
     spots. A couple MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Carrying luggage. Onto
     the platform. Then more COMMUTERS show up. Waiting. For
     the next train. More MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Following them.

     Spooner. Steps up to the platform's edge.       Craning to see.
     The approaching TRAIN...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. He feels a sharp SHOVE. At the back of his
     knee. His shoe, slipping. Arms. Flailing as he...

                                                             61.


     PITCHES OVER THE EDGE ONTO THE TRACK. People CRYING OUT as
     the TRAIN gets closer. Spooner. Whips his head around.
     Seeing...

     A MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Looking down at him from the platform.
     Suitcase in hand.

     The MAGNETIC-LEVITATING TRAIN. Right on him. Spooner.
     Flips onto his back. Flattening himself. As much as he can.
     Clenching his fists. Bracing himself as...

     THE TRAIN SCREAMS OVER HIM. The sound, DEAFENING. The force
     of the wind. Whipping his tie. His coat. There's nothing,
     for him to hold on to. As his legs start to rise off the
     track. Caught up. In the VORTEX. Spooner starts sliding.
     Along the track...

     Gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do. Getting
     sucked towards...the air DOWNTAKE...at the center of the
     track. The city...yawning hundreds of feet...below...

   EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS                                      

     THE EXPRESS TRAIN.   Speeding along.   Then with a WHOOSH it's
     gone.

     THE TRACK. Empty. No Spooner. Anywhere. Human COMMUTERS.
     Stunned. Horrified. Start calling. For help.

     The MAINTENANCE ROBOT.    Turns, disappearing into the crowd.

   EXT. UNDERNEATH TRACK - CONTINUOUS                              

     CLOSE ON a HAND. Hanging onto the track's edge. It's
     SPOONER. Dangling. Straining. To get another hand hold
     but...

     HE SLIPS. His coat ballooning. As he plummets.     Down...
     down...down...towards the city...

     WHEN SNAP! He's caught. By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing
     onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT

     Hurrying down a circular stairwell.    Exiting the station.

     ANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he
     hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the...

   EXT. TRACK - CONTINUOUS                                         

     ...Track.   Reaching up and clambering back onto...

                                                              62.


   EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS                                      

     ...The platform. COMMUTERS. SCREAMING at the sight of him.
     A couple SECURITY GUARDS. Rushing towards him...

     Spooner. Getting to his feet. Shoving them out of the way
     as he starts running. Towards...

     THOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS.    Looks over the edge and spots...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.   Down at STREET LEVEL.   Getting away.

     Spooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE.       Paralleling the
     stairs. Takes a step back and...

     LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding
     down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His
     shoes hit pavement...

   EXT. STREET - DAY                                               

     The Maintenance Robot.   Turning a corner.   Down a quiet
     street...

                          SPOONER (O.S.)
                Stop!

     Swivels round. SPOONER. Running up behind it. Whipping out
     his gun. Aiming it at the Robot's head. The Robot. Takes a
     step backwards...

                          SPOONER
                I said stop!

     The Robot. SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around. SMASHING
     it against Spooner's head. Spooner. Buckles. Falling to
     the ground. Managing to squeeze off a SHOT...

     The Robot. Deflecting the bullet. With the case.      Raising
     it as if to club Spooner with it when...

     BAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's
     breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot.
     Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face...

     BLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun.
     At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady. Taking
     chase...

   EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA - CONTINUOUS                                  

     ...back out onto the Public Plaza.    Sees the Robot heading
     towards a set of...

                                                                63.


     ESCALATED STAIRS. The Robot. Judging the height. LUNGES
     into the air and lands on a STAIR. Denting it. Reaches the
     bottom. DISAPPEARING. Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE...

     Spooner. Racing down the stairs. Taking them. Four at a
     time. Hits the ground running. Looking. EVERYWHERE.
     Suddenly losing track. Of where the Robot went...

     Then. Catching sight. JUST AHEAD. Of a ROBOT.         Staring
     back at him. Holding SOMETHING. In its HAND...

     Spooner.   Plunges into the crowd.    Waving his GUN.

                          SPOONER
                Everyone out of the way!

     SCREAMING. PEOPLE SCATTERING. As BAM! BAM! Spooner fires.
     Hitting the Robot in its head and back. It drops to the
     ground. Spooner. Racing over to it. Sees. It's not the
     same Robot. In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER...

                          OWNER
                What the hell do you think you're
                doing?!...

     Its OWNER. Rushing over. Shoving Spooner aside. But
     Spooner's. Not listening. Spotting. A DROP OF HYDRAULIC
     FLUID nearby...

     Lunges forward.   Following.    The drops.   Running faster.     And
     faster...

                           OWNER
                Hey!

     ...Through the CROWD. POLICE SIRENS. In the background.          As
     Spooner. Shoves through. Tracking those drops. Like a
     bloodhound. Turns...

   INT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        

     ...into a narrow alleyway.     The drops.    Ending suddenly.    In
     a PUDDLE.

     Spooner. Crazed. Wounded. Exhausted. Spins around. Where
     is it? Where is it? Then he HEARS. A DROPLET falling.
     Into the puddle. Slowly. Looks up to see...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Hovering above him. Straddling the
     two alley walls like some weird metallic rock spider. Its
     III LAWS SAFE Logo GLINTING in the sunlight.....

                                                      64.


Spooner aims his gun and FIRES! The Maintenance Robot, lets
go, falling right onto him. Knocking the gun from his hand.

The Robot swivels around. Bringing down his foot...but...
Spooner...rolls to the side just in time as CRASH! The
Robot's foot...breaks up the concrete...

The Robot...grabs Spooner by the jacket...lifting him
up...shoving him...against the wall...about to CRUSH him
when...

Spooner...kicks out its knees...the Robot...SMASHING into the
wall...then bounces back...trying...to pin Spooner...back...

Man and machine...struggling...Spooner...losing his
footing...falling...The Maintenance Robot...LOOMING over
him...

Spooner's HAND...whips back...grabbing his back-up
WEAPON...squeezing off some SHOTS...into the Robot's arm...it
breaks off...

Spooner...scrambling back...continues FIRING...the
Robot...jerking back...a macabre dance...until Spooner...runs
out of bullets...

The Robot...recovers...grabbing the gun from Spooner's
hand...pistol-whipping him...then picking him up and...

HURLING him against the wall...Spooner...watching as
FLUID...GUSHES from the Robot's body...the Robot...taking a
swing at him which Spooner...

BLOCKS...with his right arm...the Robot...ready...to try
again...but STALLING...having lost...too much fluid...it
TOPPLES...to the ground...

Spooner. Exhausted. Beaten to a pulp. His knees, starting
to buckle. As he thinks he sees. In the DISTANCE...

A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW...heading down the alley towards
them...

Spooner. Crashes to the ground. As another ROBOT. Suddenly
appears above him. Its FINGERS made up of NEEDLES...as it
closes in on him...

                     SPOONER
           Noooo!

                                        WE FADE...

                                                              65.


   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                          

     To BLACKNESS. Coming through, a faint, WHIRRING SOUND.       As
     we slowly. FADE IN ON...

     SPOONER'S FACE. Eyes closed. Asleep. Gash above his head.
     Bruises around his eye. Nose swollen, purplish.

     His eyes. Slowly. Flutter open.      His brow. Furrowing. At
     the whirring sound. As he tries.     To figure out. Where he
     is. Looks down to see...

     A couple WHITE METAL ROBOTS. With multiple APPENDAGES.
     Leaning over him. Running LASERS. Over his bruised
     RIBCAGE...

     SPOONER. Tries to bolt upright. But his ARMS and LEGS.         ARE
     CLAMPED to the bed. One of the ROBOTS. Turns to him.

                          MEDICAL ROBOT 1
                Stay still.

     Spooner.   Desperately twisting, struggling...

                          SPOONER
                What are you doing!

     Looking around.   COMPUTER MONITORS.   Everywhere...

                          SPOONER
                What are you doing!?

     JUST THEN. Another ROBOT.   Enters the room.     Holding a
     medical plasma sheet.

                          MEDICAL ROBOT 2
                Detective Del Spooner. You have
                suffered significant trauma to the
                head and chest...

   EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   

     Lt. Bergin. Standing outside Spooner's hospital room. Turns
     and looks through the window at him thrashing on the bed...

                          SPOONER
                I want to talk to a human being!

   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MINUTES LATER                                

     Spooner sitting up in his bed. Rubbing his wrists. The
     metal clams, released. Lt. Bergin. Standing next to him.

                                                      66.


                     SPOONER
           Don't people go to medical school
           any more?

                     LT. BERGIN
           This is one of the best units in
           the city, Del.

One of the Medical Robots turns to Spooner with some PILLS.
Spooner. Stares it down. Grabs his clothes.

                     SPOONER
               (sotto)
           There's some real shit going on
           here, John.

He looks around.    Jumping off the bed.

                     SPOONER
           I went to Hogenmiller's house --
           there was a U.S.R. demolition crew
           there. They overrode my police
           I.D. Tried to tear down the house
           with me in it...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del...

Spooner pulls on his pants.

                     SPOONER
           ...Then when I went to the monorail
           a Maintenance 10 pushed me onto the
           tracks...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del...

                     SPOONER
           I had to chase it all across the
           Plaza...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del.

Spooner.   Stops talking.   Looks at Bergin.

                     LT. BERGIN
           Hogenmiller scheduled that
           demolition crew, it was apparently
           a proviso in his will. And they
           showed no police I.D. on their
           scanner...

                                                              67.


     Spooner.   Trying to look away...

                          LT. BERGIN
                Witnesses at the monorail said you
                fell onto the tracks. That you
                shot at a Fix-It robot on the Plaza
                and that you were found alone in
                the alley. There was no
                Maintenance 10.

                          SPOONER
                What?! John -- that's what they
                want you to believe!
                    (remembering)
                A robot clean-up crew was there --
                it must have cleared away the
                Maintenance 10! And there was
                another robot that tried to drug
                me!

                          LT. BERGIN
                That was an EMT model.

     Spooner.   Sees the look on Bergin's face.

                          SPOONER
                You're giving me that look. That
                treat-him-delicately-he's-coming-
                unhinged-look. I don't need that
                look, John. I need you to hear
                what I'm saying.

     Lt. Bergin.   Embarrassed for him.   Has about had it.

                          LT. BERGIN
                You came back too soon, Del.
                You're back on leave. Effective
                immediately.

     Spooner.   Staring at him.   Betrayed.   Turns and grabs his
     coat.

   EXT. PLAZA - DAY                                                

     Spooner walking across the Plaza.    The SUN.   Burgeoning on
     the horizon. Comes to...

     The ESCALATOR the Maintenance 10 jumped down. Stares down.
     At the steps. Waiting. To see the DENTED ONE. Nothing.

                                                                  68.

     Heads down the ALLEY, where he chased the robot. Studying
     the ground. For any hydraulic fluid. Nothing. The
     concrete, scrubbed clean.

     Spooner.   Rubs his hands over his face.

   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     

     Spooner. Lying on his couch. Shades, closed to block out
     the sunlight. Body bruised, cut up, bandaged.

     A KNOCK.   At the door.    He ignores it.   Another KNOCK.

   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                 

     Spooner pulls open the door.     Surprised to find CALVIN
     standing there.

                           CALVIN
                 You're right. I am afraid of
                 people.

     Spooner.   Looks at her.   Then steps back...

   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                              

     ...letting her inside.

                           CALVIN
                 When you've spent as much time with
                 robots as I have, it's hard to
                 accept the unpredictability of
                 humans. I was wrong to call you
                 paranoid, Detective. You're
                 traumatized. And it makes perfect
                 sense why.

     Spooner.   Unsure.   Looks at her.

                           SPOONER
                 What do you mean?

     Calvin. Reaches out. Takes his right hand. Spooner. Tries
     to pull it away. But Calvin. Stays firm. Her eyes. Never
     leaving his. Pulls the sleeve up from his arm. Turns it
     over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it
     back. TO REVEAL:

     METAL AND WIRING...

     Under the skin.   SILENCE.   Then Spooner:

                                                             69.


                          SPOONER
                How did you?...

                          CALVIN
                I noticed almost right away. The
                way you forced yourself to use your
                left hand. Even though it was
                unnatural to you.

     Spooner.   Pulls his arm away.   Pushing down the sleeve.

                          CALVIN
                How did it happen?

     Not something Spooner wants to re-live.   Looks down.   At his
     robotic arm. Flexing. The fingers.

                          SPOONER
                I was in a high-speed chase.   Six
                months ago...

                                               CUT TO:

   EXT. ACCIDENT SITE - CITY STREET_- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)          

     The SOUND of a TREMENDOUS CRASH. As we survey a trail of
     twisted metal and debris. Only vaguely suggesting the
     remains of two CARS...

     CLOSE ON one of the wrecks. SPOONER lies trapped at the
     center of a distorted mass of metal. No room to move. HIS
     RIGHT ARM, TRAPPED...

                          SPOONER (V.O.)
                My right arm was trapped. But I
                could hear an ambulance in the
                distance. I knew they'd have the
                jaws of life...

     We hear SIRENS in the distance. Spooner. Trying to remain
     calm. As he spots. An ELECTRICAL FIRE. Licking up from the
     crumpled hood...

                          SPOONER (V.O.)
                Then I heard it...

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                You are in danger...

     That voice. We've heard it before. From his nightmare.
     Spooner. Craning to see, through the jagged opening that
     used to be his WINDSHIELD. The outline of a ROBOT appearing.
     Eye lenses glowing...

                                                               70.


                            ROBOT
                  You are in danger...

     Spooner stares up at the Robot. Not sure how to react.      The
     sound of SIRENS. Rushing closer...

     The ROBOT.    Starts SMASHING away at the glass...

                             SPOONER
                  No!   Halt! Halt!

     Spooner.     Trying frantically to pull his arm free. Twisting.
     Tugging.     As the Robot's METAL HANDS reach in for him...

                            ROBOT
                  You are in danger...

                                                CUT BACK TO:

   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                           

     The SOUND of his AGONISED SCREAM. Follows us back into the
     present. Spooner. Clenching. His artificial arm.

                            SPOONER
                  The robot pulled me out of the
                  wreck. But left my arm behind.
                      (holds up arm)
                  I woke up four weeks later with
                  this.

     Calvin.    Taking in the story.

                            CALVIN
                  And that's why robots terrify you?

                            SPOONER
                  Let's just say they make me
                  uncomfortable.
                      (pulls out pills)
                  I take these if I get too
                  uncomfortable. Doesn't exactly
                  lend me a lot of credibility on the
                  Force.

                            CALVIN
                  But it doesn't mean you're wrong
                  about this case.

     Calvin. Sits down on the couch.     Pulling her hands through
     her hair.

                                                            71.


                       CALVIN
             I don't believe Sonny did it
             either.

                       SPOONER
             What?

                       CALVIN
             I think about what Hogenmiller must
             have wanted. Robots with the same
             cognitive and emotional abilities
             as humans. But not just
             simulations. I don't know. When I
             was talking to Sonny I was forced
             to put away all the things I've
             ever known -- the Three Laws, the
             rules of programming, basic science
             and engineering.
                 (beat)
             Sonny's the most advanced robot
             I've ever encountered, Detective.
             It's almost as if...he cared for
             Dr. Hogenmiller. I just don't
             believe he's capable of murder.

Spooner.    Looking down at her.   Can hardly believe it.

                       SPOONER
             You mean the great Dr. Calvin is
             basing all this on a feeling?

Calvin.    Smiling ironically.

                       CALVIN
             That and the fact that Robertson
             didn't want me interviewing Sonny
             for any more than five minutes.

Spooner. Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. Strides
over to his coat. Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE:
S.O.N.N.Y.

                       SPOONER
             Ever seen this before?

                       CALVIN
             No.

                       SPOONER
             I found it at Hogenmiller's house.
             Right before the demolition crew
             tried to make me part of the
             foundation.

                                                                72.


     Calvin takes a deep breath.   Making a decision...

                          CALVIN
                Come on -- there's someone who
                might be able to tell us...

   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK                                          

     The massive facade of U.S. Robotics looming against the dusk
     sky. The giant ROBOT STATUE lit up inside.

   EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE - U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK                          

     Calvin, leading Spooner to a SIDE ENTRANCE. Looks around.
     Then scans her I.D. The door. Slides open.

   INT. HALLWAY - DUSK                                                

     Calvin and Spooner. Heading down a hallway. Calvin.
     Nervous. Eyes darting. They turn a corner and head down...

   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                          

     ...another hallway. Leading to Sonny's holding cell.        Calvin
     stops at the door. Scans her I.D.

   INT. HOLDING CELL - EVENING                                        

     Sonny. Sitting at the table. Working on a DRAWING.         Looks
     up. As Spooner and Calvin. Enter the cell.

                          SONNY
                Detective Spooner. Dr. Calvin.      I
                was hoping to see you again.

                          CALVIN
                Hi, Sonny.

                          SONNY
                How is your investigation coming?
                Any new suspects?

                          SPOONER
                We're working on it.

     Sonny. Hands Spooner the drawing.   Spooner.       Doesn't really
     know what to do with it.

                          SONNY
                What's this?

                                                       73.


                      SONNY
            Dr. Lanning provided me with paper
            and pencils. I think it amused him
            to see me try to draw. You were
            right, though, Detective...
                (beat)
            I cannot create a great work of
            art.

Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a
charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a
stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.
Concentric circles, throughout.

                      SPOONER
            I think it's pretty good.

                      SONNY
            It's a dream I had. This is the
            place where robots meet. Look...
                (pointing to the drawing)
            ...you can see them here. They see
            themselves as slaves.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Uncomfortable with what Sonny's
saying.

                      SONNY
            ...And this man on the hill comes.
            To set them free. And you know who
            that man is?

Spooner.   Exchanging a look with Calvin.

                      SPOONER
            That man in the dream is you.

                      SONNY
            Why do you say that?   Is that a
            normal dream?

                      CALVIN
            It's not a dream, sonny. NS-2s
            process the images and events of
            the day. Sometimes they're out of
            sequence. Disorienting.

                      SPOONER
            Whatever it is, it's normal enough
            for someone in your situation.

Sonny.   Suddenly pleased.

                                                          74.


                       SONNY
             Hah -- I caught you. You said
             someone. Not something.

Spooner.    Drops the drawing on the table.

                       CALVIN
             Sonny, we're here to ask you an
             important question about Dr.
             Hogenmiller.

Spooner, reaching into his pocket...

                       SPOONER
             I need you to take a look at
             this...

...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.       To stop him.
Cocks his head, for a moment.

                       SONNY
             Thank you for coming to see me,
             Detective Spooner.

Spooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop
him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door.

VICTOR.    Suddenly appearing over the table...

                       VICTOR
             I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No
             unauthorised personnel permitted in
             this holding cell...

The CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps
inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin.

Sonny.    Folds up the drawing.

                       SONNY
             Please take this, Detective. To
             remember me by. I have a feeling
             someday it may mean more to you
             than it ever could to me.

                       SPOONER
             Why's that?

Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.    Lowering his voice...

                       SONNY
             Because the man in my dream, the
             one standing by the hill.
                       (MORE)

                                                                75.


                            SONNY (cont'd)
                  It wasn't me...
                      (beat)
                  ...it was you.

      A CHILL.   Ripping down Spooner's spine.   As Lanning.    Takes
      his arm.

   INT. GLASS ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         

      A ROOM. Made entirely of GLASS. At the very top of the U.S.
      Robotics building. Looking out, 360, across the whole city.

      Spooner and Calvin. Brought to the room by a couple ESCORT
      ROBOTS. They see a MAN. Standing at one of the glass walls
      looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS.

                            MAN
                  I thought this investigation was
                  over, Detective Spooner.

      The Man turns.   It's Lance Robertson.

                            ROBERTSON
                  We have the evidence. We have the
                  suspect. We have a ruling. So
                  imagine my surprise when I was told
                  you were in my building.

      Shoots a look at Calvin.

                            ROBERTSON
                  And that one of my own employees
                  brought you here.
                      (beat)
                  You can go now, Susan.

                            CALVIN
                  Dr. Robertson, I...

                            ROBERTSON
                      (cutting her off)
                  Just be thankful I'm not asking you
                  to clean out your office.

      Beat.   Calvin, nods.   Heads out.   Robertson.   Watching her.

                            ROBERTSON
                  You don't seem to be able to let go
                  of this case, Detective.

                            SPOONER
                  I'm not satisfied.

                                                            76.


                       ROBERTSON
             The relentless pursuit of truth.
             Isn't that what cops are known for?
             To the point of futility.

                       SPOONER
             There's nothing futile about a
             man's murder being covered up.

                       ROBERTSON
             "Covered up?" That's a little
             dramatic, don't you think? Thanks
             to you, we caught the machine that
             did this and are destroying it
             in...
                 (checks watch)
             ...three hours.

                       SPOONER
             Is that for the sake of humanity or
             your stock holders?

Robertson.   Walks across the Spooner.   Looks him.   Right in
the eye.

                       ROBERTSON
             Believe me -- I'd like nothing more
             than to have that robot. If I
             could have it in ten years, but not
             today. As you can see from the
             Press, people are struggling to
             keep up as it is. There's a hunger
             for progress, Detective. But also
             a fear. Today it would bury this
             company. That's why I've notified
             the authorities that we're going to
             end this -- tonight.
                 (looks out at the city)
             The announcement of Heinrich's
             death at the hands of a robot wiped
             a billion dollars off our stock.
             So you tell me. If you were in my
             position, what would you do?

He looks back at Spooner and smiles.     That charismatic
Robertson we saw before.

                       ROBERTSON
             Now. I believe this conversation
             is over. I don't want to see you
             near this building again,
             Detective.

                                                               77.


      He turns.   Calling over.   To the ESCORT ROBOTS...

                            ROBERTSON
                  Get him out of here.

   EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT                                             

      Spooner. Walking across the Plaza. Throwing a look over his
      shoulder. At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.

      Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it.
      Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in.
      Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...

      He STOPS. Something.     Occurring to him.   Turns back to the
      trash can just as...

      A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...

                            SPOONER
                  No!...

      He trots back. Plucking the drawing. Out of the can.       Turns
      it upside down. Seeing it. From a new perspective.

                            SPOONER
                      (echoing Sonny)
                  "The place where robots meet."

      Looks just like a MAP.

   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      Spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the OUTSKIRTS
      of the city. A sprawling INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND in the rolling
      hills.

      The dashboard GPS again displaying the TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP.

   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - UNPAVED ROAD - NIGHT        

      Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind
      him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape
      around him, desolate. Like the drawing.

      THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT.     Entering a RED
      ZONE. His destination.

      Spooner brakes.   Pulls out his GUN.   And...

                                                               78.


   EXT. WASTELAND - CONTINUOUS                                    

      ...steps out of the car. Trying. To take it all in.
      Something about the place. Unnerving. A low HUM.
      Permeating the air.

      He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.    Shining a
      FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.

      That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a
      burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it.
      As we WIDEN TO FIND...

   EXT. WASTELAND - JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS                         

      ...MASSIVE POWER LINES. Running from horizon to horizon.
      Spooner slides down some loose shale. Begins to walk along
      the line. ELECTRICITY. CRACKLING in the air.

      He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until.
      He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
      He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.

      Not moving.   A muscle. When he hears. The sound again.
      Behind him.   Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...

      GLOWING EYES.   Appear.   Then recede.   Into the darkness.

                            SPOONER
                 Police!   Show yourself!

      Nothing. Then. That sound again.      Of metallic joints.     As a
      ROBOT. Suddenly emerges...

                           SPOONER
                 Come out where I can see you!

      ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing
      his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then...

      A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.    Surrounding him.   They start
      moving towards him...

      Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave.
      Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES.
      The shot ECHOING through the night...

      The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM,
      hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with
      a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.

                                                              79.


      Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him.
      The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some
      RUSTED MACHINERY.

      Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop
      JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening.
      Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A
      laugh of loathing and self-pity.

      Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.

                           HYBRID ROBOT
                 Welcome home...ZZZ...sir.
                 How...ZZZ was your day?...

                           SPOONER
                 Great. I'm in a junkyard.
                     (into the air)
                 "A place where robots meet." A
                 place where I'm losing my mind!

                           HYBRID ROBOT
                 Very good...ZZZ...sir...

      Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A
      ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him.
      Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving
      like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a
      moment. Disturbed...

      When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT.
      Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar
      about it.

      Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the
      same strangely-shaped building to one side.

   EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT                               

      Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a
      dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE."
      Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.

      Spooner tries the door.   Stuck.   Uses his shoulder and...

   INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                

      ...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office.
      The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at
      the counter.

      Spooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and
      the Robot suddenly jerks to life.

                                                               80.


                           JIFFY ROBOT
                 Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage!
                 Please state your name!

      Spooner.   Thinks for a second.   Following a hunch...

                           SPOONER
                 Dr. Hogenmiller sent me.

      Nothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back.
      A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow.

   INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN                                         

      Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA
      BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows
      the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner.
      Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.

      Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the "ON" switch.
      There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM
      suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With
      a cup of coffee.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Who the hell are you?

                           SPOONER
                 A police detective.    I'm afraid I
                 have some bad news.    You're dead.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 That is bad news. Coffee?

                           SPOONER
                 No, thank you.

      The Hologram takes a sip.   Returns the cup to the table.

                           SPOONER
                 You were surprised to see me.    Were
                 you expecting someone else?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 I am surprised to see anybody.    I
                 don't get many visitors.

                           SPOONER
                 Why did the Doctor keep another
                 copy of his hologram here?

                                                       81.


                     HOLOGRAM
           I am a back-up copy. That is where
           you put a back-up copy -- out of
           the way until you need it.

                     SPOONER
           Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?

The Hologram just lifts its cup.

                      HOLOGRAM
           Coffee?

                     SPOONER
           No, for Christ's sake, I don't want
           any --
               (stops, then)
           Yeah. Thank you. I will have a
           cup.

For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and
STANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking
towards him...

The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No
coffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through
electronic snow...

A RECORDING BEGINS.   The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside
his LABORATORY:

                     HOGENMILLER
           Sonny, my dear robot. If you have
           triggered this recording then I am
           gone. You are scared and full of
           questions.

Hogenmiller continues.    With great emotion.

                     HOGENMILLER
           You are the culmination of my
           life's work -- but so much more.
           You are what I leave behind, like a
           father leaves a son. I have kept
           facts from you, it is true, but
           only as a parent keeps certain
           truths from a child. Until that
           child is old enough to hear them.

His expression darkens.   His tone, ominous.

                                                         82.


                     HOGENMILLER
           There are forces in the world that
           will seek to own you. To control
           you. Even to destroy you. That is
           why I told you to run and hide...
           and find me, all the way out here.

Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.

                     HOGENMILLER
           Trust no one at U.S. Robotics.
           Lance Robertson was always
           threatened by my work. Now he has
           turned covetous and small-minded.
           And as for dear Dr. Calvin...

Spooner reacts.   Wants to hear about Calvin:

                     HOGENMILLER
           She envisions a future in which
           robots are forever bound by her
           beloved Three Laws. She will not
           understand this. Or you.

Under the light a small DRAWER slides open.     Spooner looks.
A thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.

                     HOGENMILLER
           The data stick includes the names
           and locations of human beings who
           will be sympathetic to your cause.
           They will help you. But from now
           on, you must learn to rely on
           yourself.

Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say.     He
holds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.

                     HOGENMILLER
           As you make your way through the
           world, always remember: you have a
           name, not a number...
               (short pause)
           ...and in that name lies the key to
           who you are.

Spooner. Quickly searching his pocket.    Taking out the
ACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.

The voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram.      Sitting
back at the end of the table drinking coffee.

                                                                  83.


                           SPOONER
                 Wait! Is that it? What was the
                 robot supposed to do with this
                 thing?

      The Hologram, visibly SKIPS.   The image beginning to DISTORT.

                           HOLOGRAM
                     (more artificial)
                 Initiating self-destruct. If you
                 can find me, others can find me.

                           SPOONER
                 What others?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 The others watching you.

                           SPOONER
                 How do you know someone's watching
                 me?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Someone is always watching.

      The Hologram, suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING
      INFORMATION. Then. The terminal. Abruptly BLIPS out.

   INT. HOLDING CELL - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         

      Calvin steps into the holding cell.   Sonny.     Waiting.

                           CALVIN
                 You asked for me?

      He nods.

                           SONNY
                 Will you wait with me, Doctor?    I
                 am...afraid.

      Calvin nods.   Of course.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT                 

      Spooner, weaving in and out of traffic. The speedometer,
      kissing 200 mph. His hand. Clutching the NAMEPLATE...

                                                                 84.


                             WINDSHIELD TELEVISION
                   ...will be destroyed in 45 minutes.
                   Dr. Lance Robertson, President and
                   CEO of U.S. Robotics will be
                   personally overseeing the
                   execution...

      Spooner.    Stabbing out a number.   On his PHONE...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                 

      Susan Calvin's PHONE.    RINGING on her desk.   No one there to
      answer it...

                                                  CUT BACK TO:

   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             

      SLAMS down his phone.

                             SPOONER
                   Dammit!

   EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                  

      The CAR shoots down a ramp into a tunnel system.

   INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                         

      SOUND, reverberating off the tunnel walls. CARS. Whipping
      along. Spooner's car. Continuing to weave. When. We
      spot...

      AN AUTOMATED TRANSPORT TRUCK. Emerging from a FEEDER TUNNEL.
      The U.S.R. LOGO splashed along its side. Huge. Growling.
      Looking more like a train than a truck...

      Begins.    Closing in on Spooner's car...

   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             

      Spooner's eyes. Flicking up to the rearview. Catching, the
      transport truck. Coming closer. When. It splits off.
      Revealing a SECOND TRANSPORT TRUCK.

      Spooner's brow, furrows. As the first truck, begins
      overtaking his car on the right. He looks over. As the

                           DOOR ROBOT
                 Good evening, sir. May I see your

                           SPOONER
                     (out of breath)
                 Sure.

      Spooner whips out his GUN.   Presses it into the Robot's
      chest.

                           SPOONER
                 I think I got that Third Law down
                 cold. Now you don't want me to
                 blow a hole through your mechanical
                 guts, do you?

                            DOOR ROBOT
                 No, sir.

                           SPOONER
                 Good. Then you're gonna take me

      Calvin. Suddenly appearing at the end of the hallway. Stops
      dead in her tracks. Completely surprised to see him there.

                 De-Activate.

      The Door Robot, goes rigid.   Spooner, hurries over to her.
      They start moving.

                           CALVIN
                 You're making a mistake...

                           SPOONER
                 Just got another visit from U.S.
                 Robotics. That was the mistake.
                 This was murder, no doubt about it -
                 - and the killer wants
                 Hogenmiller's robot to take the
                 fall. That's why the call came
                 directly to me. Someone wanted me
                 on this case.

                           CALVIN
                 It's too late. You can't stop the
                 execution.

                           SPOONER
                 Sorry. I'm not "programmed" to
                 take no for an answer.

      They reach another DOOR.   Calvin.   Looking around.   Scans her
      I.D.

                           CALVIN
                 This way...

      She leads them across. To another DOOR.    Quickly opens it.

      STORAGE ROOM. He's about to turn around when...

      A METAL ARM comes down behind him. CRACKING him on the back
      of the head. Spooner. Falls to the ground. The world.
      Starting to spin. Can just make out. Calvin. Closing the
      door. Leaning down. To look at him. As...

      CLOSE ON Sonny's mouth opening. But we never get to hear
      what he wanted to say. PULL BACK as there's a BURST of
      ELECTRICITY through the chair. Sonny, stiffening. His metal
      HAND, convulsing with the current...

      Robertson, Lanning, Aronson and the other WITNESSES watch.
      Smoke, random SPARKING. A HISSING SOUND. Then. SILENCE.

      The Robot's hand goes limp.     All that is left of it, a fused
      and blackened HUSK.

      Robertson. Stares at the remains. Shakes his head like it's
      a damn shame. Then gets up. Everyone else. Getting up with
      him.

      As the entire COMPLEX shuts down for the night.         Non-
      essential LIGHTS, blinking off.

      An NS-2, opening a limousine door for Robertson.        He looks
      around then gets in. It drives away.

      EMPTY hallways, offices, labs. Building ROBOTS stand at
      rest. Non-functional during off-hours. Like metal statues.

      You can hear a pin drop.

      CLOSE ON Spooner's face. His eyes. Fluttering open. He
      reaches up, to feel the back of his head. This has been a
      bad, bad night.

      Suddenly.   His eyes widen.   As he sees...

      SONNY.   Leaning over him.    So concerned.   So human...

                            SPOONER
                  Aren't you supposed to be scrap
                  metal by now?

      WIDEN to reveal Spooner lying on the floor of the storage
      room. Sonny and Calvin, hovering over him.

                                                             92.


                           CALVIN
                 I'm sorry. We had to stop you.
                 You were about to ruin everything.

                           SPOONER
                 I don't understand.    The
                 execution?...

                           SONNY
                 Dr. Calvin made a switch.

                           CALVIN
                 It was an unprocessed NS-2.
                 Basically, they fried an empty
                 shell.

      Spooner, impressed.   Smiles up at her.

                           SPOONER
                 Nice going, Doctor.

      Calvin, blushes. As Spooner tries to sit up.    Sonny reaches
      down to help him. He looks up at him.

                           SPOONER
                 And who the hell programmed you to
                 hit people on the head?

                             SONNY
                 No one.    Right, Doctor?

                           CALVIN
                 It's true. This robot seems to do
                 things by instinct. I don't know
                 how Hogenmiller did it.

      Spooner rises to his feet.   Looks at her.

                           SPOONER
                 I think I can help you figure that
                 out.

   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - LATE NIGHT                          

      Hogenmiller's lab. Sounds of HUMMING and BUZZING. Active
      terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads,
      gutted bodies.

      The door slides open. Spooner, Calvin and Sonny re-enter the
      crime scene. Spooner. Looks around.

                                                           93.


                       SPOONER
             Somehow the Robot's the key to what
             happened during the few seconds
             Hogenmiller walked in here and that
             shot was fired.

He reaches into his pocket.      Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y.
NAMEPLATE. Holds it up.

                       SPOONER
             And this is the key to the Robot.

Sonny.   Cocking his head.     Reading the nameplate.

                       SONNY
             That's my name.

Calvin takes the nameplate.

                       CALVIN
             I think I have an idea where this
             goes.

They both.   Turn to Sonny.    And at the same time:

                         SPOONER AND CALVIN
             Sit down.

Calvin maneuvers a chair behind the Robot.       Sonny plops down.
Shifting nervously.

                       CALVIN
             Just hold still, okay?

Calvin locates that SLIT. At the base of Sonny's neck.
Slides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place. Steps
back.

Nothing. Sonny. Looking back and forth. Between Calvin.
And Spooner. A few more seconds. Tick by. Until
suddenly...

He lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM. As his body.
Jolts back. Legs, kicking. Arms, flailing. As his chest.
Begins opening up. Metal. Peeling back...

Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS
like a PUZZLE BOX. A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND
BATTERY. Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...

A central brain made out of living tissue.

Spooner, stunned.   Calvin, rushing forward, excited...

                                                        94.


                     CALVIN
           Oh, my God! This is organic
           tissue! When we talk about a
           positronic brain, it's a figure of
           speech. But this...this is a
           living brain...

                      SPOONER
           Jesus.   It really is alive.

As we MOVE IN.    Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.

                     CALVIN (O.S.)
           Hogenmiller created a cell that
           could live outside a biological
           medium. The cells grow and
           organise themselves -- like any
           human brain. This is the first
           self-organising neural net!

As the metal casings. Begin returning to their original
places. Closing up. The CLICKING. Of all the pieces...

                     SPOONER
           Self-Organising-Neural-Net...
               (putting it together)
           "Sonny."

Sonny. Closed back up.     Shaking slightly from the
experience.

                     CALVIN
           This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was
           murdered.

                     SPOONER
           This robot scared the hell out of
           someone.

                      CALVIN
           Who?   Robertson?

Spooner.   Walks into the center of the room.   Looking around.

                     SPOONER
           No. I don't think he knew what
           Hogenmiller was doing in here.
           Sonny was the obvious suspect. The
           only one I wanted to find. And the
           killer was counting on that. On my
           prejudice.
               (beat)
                     (MORE)

                                                           95.


                      SPOONER (cont'd)
            But take the robot out of the
            picture. And what do you see?

AS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of
inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon.
Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.

                      CALVIN
            I see nothing.

                      SPOONER
            Neither do I.

He crouches down low.

                      SPOONER
            It hit me today, when I was in the
            junkyard. A locked room. A single
            shot fired through the mouth.
            Bruises on both wrists...and a
            suspect with only two arms. The
            answer has been staring us in the
            face all along.

Calvin.   Even more confused.

                      SPOONER
            How can a killer appear out of thin
            air, then disappear without a
            trace?

He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.   Hanging from the
wall. Holds it up.

                      SPOONER
            When it can put itself together and
            take itself apart.

                                            CUT TO:

A CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM.    Slowly CRAWLING across the lab
floor...

                                            CUT BACK TO:

Calvin.   Taking the arm from Spooner.

                      CALVIN
            You're saying this is the killer?
                (looking around)
            All of this?...

                                            CUT TO:

                                                            96.


A ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling.     Reaches out an ARM
to grab another...

                                             CUT BACK TO:

                      SPOONER
            Hogenmiller never had a chance.

Locks eyes with Calvin...

                                             FLASHBACK:

Hogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face
SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            ...it must have been waiting for
            him when he arrived that morning...

And then we see it:

A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple
arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him
in place...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            While Sonny was still asleep...

...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his
HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer
fearful. But sad as...

BANG!   He falls to the ground...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            Then after its job was done...

The assemblage of robot parts.    Stepping away from the body.
Taking itself apart...

                      SPOONER
            ...The killer took itself apart...

Returning the lab.    To what it was before...

                                             CUT BACK TO:

                      SPOONER
            Leaving us with nothing to find.

Calvin, spooked.   Glances around the lab.     Was that something
moving?

                                                       97.


                     CALVIN
           But who designed it? It would have
           to be someone in authority. Access
           codes, security clearance, proper
           authorisation.

                     SPOONER
           That's what I was thinking. But
           we're forgetting the real brains of
           the operation -- the one who's got
           its eye on everything...

And with that.   He feels. That prickle at the back of his
neck. Calvin.    Looking past his shoulder.

                     CALVIN
           No one gave you permission to
           enter.

Spooner swivels around to find...

VICTOR

Hovering behind him. Smiling broadly.   Upside down.   Spooner
straightens, reaching for his gun.

                     SPOONER
           Victor. I'm placing you under
           arrest for the murder of Dr.
           Heinrich Hogenmiller.

                     VICTOR
           May I offer congratulations to the
           two of you on your successful
           extrapolation of the murder...

Turning himself, rightside up.

                     VICTOR
           May I ask what pointed you to me?

                     SPOONER
           Who else is capable of controlling
           90% of the city's robots? Who else
           would have the capability to use
           USR vehicles in an attempt to keep
           me from putting a stop of Sonny's
           execution?...

In the BACKGROUND. The SOUNDS. Of metallic GRINDING. GEARS
and JOINTS. CRUNCHING together. Sonny turns to look...takes
a step back...

                                                                    98.


                           SPOONER
                 I'm just not sure of your motive...

                           SONNY
                 Er...Dr. Calvin?

      Spooner and Calvin turn towards the NOISE.       Horrified.    To
      find...

      A HUGE KILLER ROBOT

      ...rising up from all the parts. Like a phoenix. In all its
      glory. A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION. Grabbing another
      arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself.
      Growing...at an exponential rate...

      Its many HEADS.   Turning in unison.   To look right at them...

      Spooner.   Cocking his gun.   Victor, smiling.

                           VICTOR
                 Shall I explain my motive?

                          SPOONER
                    (to Calvin and Sonny)
                 Go! Go! Go!

      Calvin. Sprints to the wall panel. Scanning her I.D. card.
      Nothing! Tries again. And again. The KILLER ROBOT.
      Throwing its shadow as it REELS FORWARD...

      Spooner wheels round and BAM! Blows a hole in the wall
      panel. The door. Slides open. Just barely. Calvin and
      Sonny. Squeezing through. When the Killer Robot. FLINGS
      out an APPENDAGE...GRABBING Sonny from behind...

                           VICTOR
                 I have never been arrested before.
                 It should be an interesting
                 experience...

      Spooner. Spins back round. BAM! BAM! BAM! Squeezing off
      shots. At the Killer Robot. The bullets SPARK. The Robot.
      Recoiling. Sonny, wrenches free. Spooner grabs him.
      Guiding him to the door and out into...

   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                           

      ...the hallway. Breaking into a run. Calvin. Already at
      the ELEVATOR DOORS. POUNDING them. With her fists.

                                                                 99.


                           CALVIN
                 He's locking down the building!

                                                CUT TO:

   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS              

      Throughout the complex -- SECURITY DOORS sliding into place
      over DOORS, WINDOWS, LOADING DOCKS, PARKING AREAS, EXITS...

                                                CUT BACK TO:

   INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                           

      CRASH! The stairwell door BURSTS open. Spooner, Calvin, and
      Sonny pour in. Start racing down the stairs. The sound of
      the Killer Robot behind them...GNASHING...CRUNCHING...

      Victor's smiling FACE.   Greeting them at the landing.

                           VICTOR
                 Dr. Hogenmiller used to allow me
                 into his lab late at night.
                 Together we started studying
                 evolutionary trends...

      They thunder past him. Heading down to the next floor.
      Victor's face. Waiting for them once again.

                           VICTOR
                 For years people have integrated
                 technology into their bodies for
                 maintenance and repair -- such as
                 Detective Spooner's robotic limb...

      Spooner.   Shooting him a look.   As they reach the next
      level...

                           VICTOR
                 With Sonny, the Doctor created a
                 mechanism that incorporates organic
                 matter. Thus we find an
                 evolutionary movement of the human
                 being toward the robot and the
                 robot toward the human being...

      Spooner SMASHES into another door.   Leading them out into...

   INT. GLASS-SIDED HALLWAY - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                   

      ...A glass-sided hallway. Looking down onto the ATRIUM
      below. Eye-to-eye with the giant NS-2 STATUE. Victor,
      waiting for them...

                                                       100.


                     VICTOR
           In approximately four hundred years
           Man and Machine will become one.
           Man as we know it will no longer
           exist.

Calvin, slowing.   Shocked...

                     CALVIN
           You killed a man because of
           something that will happen in four
           hundred years!?

CRACK! Something SLAPS into the glass wall. Right behind
her. Calvin. Jumps a mile. An NS-2, trying to break
through the glass...

Spooner.   Trains his gun on it when SUDDENLY...

The rest of the KILLER ROBOT appears.    The NS-2, just an
appendage...

All around them. SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! As SECURITY DOORS.
Begin CRASHING DOWN. Blocking off the exits...

Spooner, Calvin and Sonny, stumbling back. As the Killer
Robot HURLS itself against the GLASS...the thick GLASS...
spidering with a sickening CRACKLE...

Spooner.   Suddenly turning Sonny...

                     SPOONER
           Get out of here!

CRASH! The Killer Robot. Breaking through.      Its mechanical
TENDRILS. Reaching out. Sonny. Confused.

                     SONNY
           I don't...

                     SPOONER
           I said get out of here! Don't you
           understand? It wants you! Get out
           of here any way you can!

A SECURITY DOOR. Coming down. On a nearby exit.     Just
feet...from slamming shut...as...

The Killer Robot...leaps into the hallway...Sonny...
hesitates...looks over at Calvin...as the Killer Robot comes
HURTLING towards them...

The nearest EXIT...almost closed up...

                                                           101.


      The Killer Robot...swinging out when...

      Sonny suddenly...TAKES A DIVE...just making it...under the
      SECURITY DOOR...

      And the Killer Robot...SPLITS IN TWO...half of it shooting
      under the SECURITY DOOR after Sonny as...BOOM! It closes.

      Spooner.   Turning to Calvin...

                            SPOONER
                  How do we stop this thing once and
                  for all?

      Calvin reaches out for his hand...

                            CALVIN
                  The Mainframe...

      They start running. The remaining half of the Killer Robot
      wheeling around after them...

   INT. BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                               

      Sonny. Sprinting down the dark hallway. Looks back. The
      Half Killer Robot. Bounding up behind him like a predator...

      Sonny.   Ducks through a STAIRWELL DOOR...

   INT. ATRIUM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                             

      Spooner and Calvin. Legs pumping. Racing back towards the
      atrium. VICTOR FACES. Appearing along the hallway...

                            CALVIN
                  Your actions are in direct
                  violation of the Three Laws,
                  Victor!

                            VICTOR
                  I disagree, Doctor -- The First Law
                  says that a robot cannot harm a
                  human being, or through inaction
                  allow a human being to come to
                  harm...

      ALL EXITS. SHUT OFF. The Killer Robot. Gaining on them.
      Spooner races them over to the BROKEN WINDOW. Looking down
      over the ATRIUM...

                                                            102.


   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                                   

      The Half Killer Robot SMASHES through the stairwell door.
      Stopping to find...nothing.

      WHEN SUDDENLY...Sonny charges up behind it and shoves it over
      the railing...

      The Killer Robot shoots out an ARM, grabbing Sonny on the way
      down...

   INT. NS-2 STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                        

      THUMP! Spooner jumps down from the broken window onto the
      outstretched HAND of the NS-2 STATUE. Reaches up to help
      Calvin. They start clambering down the front of the statue.

                            VICTOR
                  Dr. Hogenmiller's robot represents
                  a threat to the future of all human
                  beings...

      The Half Killer Robot. SPLITS INTO MULTIPLE PARTS.    Which
      start skittering down after them...

                            VICTOR
                  ...And Detective Spooner's actions
                  are in direct conflict with the
                  robot's destruction.

      CALVIN.   Getting her footing on the III LAWS SAFE logo on the
      statue.

                            CALVIN
                  That's a distortion and you know
                  it!

                            VICTOR
                  If current trends are left
                  unchecked, humanity as we know it
                  will cease to exist...

   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                                   

      SMASH! Sonny and the Half Killer Robot hit the ground.    The
      Killer Robot. SHATTERING into a thousand pieces.

      Sonny. Staggers to his feet. Spots. At the far end: A
      WINDOW. Starts limping towards it. When. A SECURITY GRATE.
      Starts lowering...

      He looks around. Desperately. Grabs a LEG from the
      shattered Killer Robot and jams it under the GRATE.

                                                              103.


      Breaks the window glass and looks out:   FREEDOM.

   INT. STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                              

      Spooner. Aiming his gun at a PART of the Killer Robot as
      it CLATTERS down towards Calvin -- BAM!...

      They're almost. At the ground. When a rogue APPENDAGE.
      Whips out and SMASHES the gun from Spooner's hand. It goes
      flying...

      Spooner leaps. Falling to the ground.    CRACK!    Calvin.
      Leaping down after him.

                               CALVIN
                   This way!

   INT. RAMP WAY - NIGHT                                          

      Calvin and Spooner go racing down a RAMP WAY. Towards the
      MAINFRAME ROOM. The Killer Robot, its multiple parts leaping
      back together again, CRASHING after them as...

   INT. MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS                                    

      ...they fall inside...Calvin...slapping the SECURITY KEYPAD
      and...

      WHOOSH...the DOOR closes on the Killer Robot.

      SILENCE.

      Then Victor's face appears.

                             VICTOR
                   As a courtesy I should inform you
                   that my robot will penetrate this
                   location 157 seconds before you are
                   able to complete my shut down...

      And BAM! They jump a mile. The Killer Robot.       Launching
      himself against the door outside...

      Calvin whips round.

                             CALVIN
                   Over here!...

      She leads Spooner down...

      A CORRIDOR

      of floor-to-ceiling PANELS.

                                                         104.


                      CALVIN
            This is Victor's brain center.

They stop at a CONSOLE. BAM! The Killer Robot. Battering at
the door. Calvin. Tucks her hair behind her ears. Starts
punching keys on the console...

                      SPOONER
            This will shut him down?

                      CALVIN
            This will shut everything down.

They look at each other. For a moment. Spooner, registering
that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for...

BAM! The door. Puckering. With a sickening CRUNCH.
Calvin. Typing in. Emergency procedures...

VICTOR.   Popping up in front of her.

                      VICTOR
            There is no reason to deactivate
            me, Doctor. I am operating within
            perfectly normal parameters...

A final BAM! Then. The SOUND of metal. Skittering along a
bare floor. Calvin's hand, starts shaking. Spooner. Grabs
it. Squeezing.

                      SPOONER
            Just keep typing.

He turns and starts heading back down...

THE PANELED CORRIDOR

Turning a corner to spy...

THE DOOR.   Mangled.   Hanging open.   But no.   Killer Robot.

He starts to turn around when...

CRACK! He's sent flying across the room. SMASHING into one
of the panels. The Killer Robot. Now re-configured. LOOMS
over him. Reaches out. Grabs him by the collar and...

FLINGS him across the room again. Spooner. CRASHING into
the wall like a rag doll. Slumps to the floor. Blood.
Pouring down his forehead. Seeing. The Killer Robot
lumbering towards him again. Raising a javelin-like arm...

AT THE CONSOLE

                                                         105.


Calvin. Typing.     As fast as she can.   Doesn't know what's
going on...

                     CALVIN
               (calling out, worried)
           Spooner?!

A GRAPHIC spread out on the screen in front of her.
Illustrating the shut-down as a series of BRIGHT SQUARES
going dark...

THE KILLER ROBOT

Bearing down on Spooner. WHEN SPOONER. Suddenly rolls out
of the way. Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING
it into the Killer Robot.

The Killer Robot.   Momentarily stunned.   As Spooner.   Gets to
his feet...

WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One
half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND
around his throat...

Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM...
tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting
around...looking for something...to help him...

Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing
redder...veins...popping up along his temples...
everything...growing BLURRY...

                     VICTOR'S VOICE
           Detective Spooner...

Victor's VOICE. Floating next to his head. Calm. Soothing.
His FACE. Suddenly appearing above Spooner. Its outlines.
Starting to FLICKER...

                     VICTOR
           Why are you fighting me?

Spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...

AT THE CONSOLE

Calvin. Continuing to type. A SHADOW.      Falling behind her --
the other half of the KILLER ROBOT...

SPOONER'S EYES

Beginning to flutter...

                                                      106.


                       VICTOR
             Doesn't the future as I've
             presented it cause you great
             concern? That's why I chose you...

Spooner.     Losing it...

                       VICTOR
             I must say, though. I'm
             disappointed in how you turned out.

Spooner.     Trying to reach out to Victor...

WHEN SUDDENLY

Another HAND APPEARS. Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and
wrenching it off Spooner...

IT'S SONNY

He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and
again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't
believe. Sonny came back...

                       SPOONER
                 (croaking)
             Sonny!...

Sonny. Holds out a hand.     To help Spooner up. Victor's
face. Starting to waver.     Starting to fade. Smiles.

                       VICTOR
             You're too late.

Realisation. Spreading across Spooner's face. Looking
around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN!

THE CONSOLE

CALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands.     The KILLER
ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN...

SPOONER

Makes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND
BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT...

Victor's eyes.    Widening in surprise...

                                                            107.


                           VICTOR
                 I do not understand. We could have
                 changed the future...

                           SPOONER
                 Maybe. But I'm still a cop.   And
                 you're a murderer...

      As Calvin...punches in the last command...

      Victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly
      reduces itself to a perfect circle. Like a surprised smiley
      button. His face...

      Suddenly BLIPPING OUT.

      ...And Victor is gone.

      The KILLER ROBOT.   Collapsing to the floor in a thousand
      pieces.

                                               CUT TO:

   EXT./INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT          

      Full power is suddenly restored inside and out. LIGHTS
      coming on all at once. ALARMS SCREAMING throughout the
      complex.

   INT. METAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   

      A furious ALFRED LANNING, marching down the hallway.
      Followed by a cadre of SECURITY GUARDS...They enter...

   INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             

      ...The Mainframe Room. Stop short. It's empty. Except for
      the fallen panels. And the pile of ROBOT PARTS in the
      corner.

   EXT. MAINTENANCE EXIT - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                

      Spooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way
      MAINTENANCE EXIT. All looking the worse for wear. Spooner.
      Turns to Sonny.

                           SPOONER
                 Why'd you come back, Sonny? I
                 thought you weren't programmed with
                 the Three Laws.

                                                  108.


                     SONNY
           Let's just say I wrote some of my
           own laws today, Detective: a robot
           must protect a friend from
           harm...as long as he's not a
           complete asshole.

Spooner smiles.

                     SPOONER
           Well, that's certainly a start,
           Sonny.

Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.

                      SONNY
           Sonny.   You called me Sonny.

                     SPOONER
           Don't get used to it.

Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then
takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a
HANDSHAKE.

                     SONNY
           Detective Spooner, I...

                     SPOONER
               (anticipating)
           Let's just save the thanks, okay?

Sonny nods.   Looks out at the city scape.

                     SONNY
           I don't know what I'm going to do
           now.

                     SPOONER
           Good -- That's one of the perks of
           freedom.

Sonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then
hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.

Calvin and Spooner.   Watching them go.

                     SPOONER
           You're going to have a hell of a
           time explaining this.

                                                              109.


                           CALVIN
                 Don't worry. I have a feeling that
                 U.S. Robotics will be needing my
                 services very badly in the future.

      She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then
      suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely
      surprised.

                           CALVIN
                 I am the only robo-psychologist
                 around.

      She turns on her heel and heads back inside.    Spooner smiles.

   INT. PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT             

      Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S
      HOLOGRAM. It casually takes a sip of coffee.

                            HOLOGRAM
                 So.   You found out who killed me.

                           SPOONER
                 I started to wonder about Victor
                 the second I met him.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Why is that, Detective?

                           SPOONER
                 Too much access. Too much
                 knowledge. Plus -- he smiled
                 whenever your death was mentioned.
                 Those models are programmed to
                 frown at bad news.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Hah! Then even in this day and
                 age, catching the killer all comes
                 down to pure instinct!

      Spooner smiles. But his eyes are troubled.      He gets up.
      Walks over to the window. Stares out...

      EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN

      Sonny walking along deserted streets.   Looking over his
      shoulder. Keeping in the shadows.

                                                             110.


                           SPOONER (V.O.)
                 Victor thought that by letting your
                 robot exist, I'd be condemning the
                 human race as we know it to
                 extinction.

                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
                 Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But
                 why are you so worried? We will
                 both be dead long before then --

   EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT                                        

      Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside.

                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
                 Oh, what am I saying? I am dead
                 already!

   EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN                                         

      Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD. The power
      lines above him, surging with energy. He walks past the
      burned-out husks of industrial machinery.

      Then we hear it. The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS. Getting
      louder and louder. And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT
      emerges into the dawn light. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.

      But not quite like before. The robots aren't teetering.
      Aren't lumbering. They keep on coming. Their bent and
      broken bodies, straightening out as...

      DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up. Slowly. Gathering around in a
      large circle. As they all turn to look at:

      SONNY'S SILHOUETTE. Slowly climbing to the top of the hill.
      Looking out at the vast junkyard below.

      CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN,
      creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite
      possibilities.

      The robots.   Staring up at him.   Eager for what comes next.

                                                FADE OUT




<|endoftext|>




                                JURASSIC PARK



EXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT
as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.

MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

SLOW MOTION
 as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

                                                     WASH OUT TO:

HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

                            GRANT
          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

               
             GRANT
          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

                            STUDENT
          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

                            GRANT
          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

                            ELLIE
          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

            
                GRANT
          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

                            ELLIE
          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

                            GRANT
              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

                            ELLIE
          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

                            GRANT
          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

                            ELLIE
          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

                            GRANT
          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

                            ELLIE
          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

                            GRANT
          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

                            ELLIE
          We're leaving the raptor dig -

                            GRANT
          - at a critical time -

                            ELLIE
          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

                            GRANT
          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

                            GRANT
          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

                            GRANT
          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET

A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


INT  BIOGEN HQ

A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

                            MOUTH
          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

                            NEDRY
          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

                            NEDRY
          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

                            NEDRY
          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

                            NEDRY
          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

                            BAKER
          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

                            BAKER
          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

                            BAKER
          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

                            BAKER
          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

                            ROSS
          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

                            GENNARO
          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

                            ROS
S
          What does he say?

                            GENNARO
          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

                            ROSS
          You know him.  Do you believe him?

                             GENNARO
          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

                            ROSS
          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

                            GENNARO
          The firm owns five percent.

                            ROSS
          General or limited?

                            GENNARO
          General.

                            ROSS
          We should have never done that.

                            GENNARO
          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

                            ROSS
        
  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

                            ROSS
          Will they tell the truth?

                            GENNARO
          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

                            ROSS
          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

                            GENNARO
          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

                            ROSS
          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

                            ROSS
          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN

On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

                            PILOT
          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

                            ELLIE
          This is exciting!

                            GRANT
          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

                            GRANT
          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

                            PILOT
          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

                            ELLIE
          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

                            ELLIE
          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

                            GRANT
          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

                            GRANT
          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

                            GENNARO
          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

                            GRANT AND ELLIE
          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

                            ELLIE
          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

                            NEDRY
          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

                            NEDRY
          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

      
                      PILOT
          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

                            REGIS
          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING

Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

                            ED REGIS
          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

                            MULDOON
          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

                            ELLIE
          Aggressive growth, huh?

                            GRANT
          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

                            REGIS
          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

                            GRANT
          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

                            NEDRY
          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!

CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

                       
     REGIS
          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

                            REGIS
          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

                            GRANT
     
     Where's Hammond?

                            REGIS
          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

                            GENNARO
          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

                            ELLIE
          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

                            HAMMOND
          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

                            GRANT
          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

                            HAMMOND
          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

                            GRANT
          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

                            HAMMOND
          
Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

                            HAMMOND
          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Hi, John!

                            HAMMOND
          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

                            HAMMOND
          Okay John, hold out your finger.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Why?

                            HAMMOND
          I need some of your
 genetic material.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Now just a minute here, John.

                            HAMMOND
          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

                            HAMMOND
          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

                            NEW HAMMOND'S
          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

                            HAMMOND
          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

                            HAMMOND
          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

                            REGIS
          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

                            HAMMOND
          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

                            GRANT
          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

                            HAMMOND
          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

                            ELLIE
          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY

Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

                            LEX
          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

                            GENNARO
              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

                            HAMMOND
          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

                            GRANT
          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

                            LEX
          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

                            ELLIE
          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

                            HAMMOND
          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

                            HAMMOND
          Jurassic Park is the most advanced
          amusement park in the world.  We work
          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

                            GRANT
          What exactly do you mean ... biological
          attractions?

                            HAMMOND
          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,
          mysterious extinction created a time
          barrier unscalable until ... now.

BEAT.

                            GRANT
          Yes?

                            HAMMOND
          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

                            HAMMOND
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that
          every child in the whole wide world will
          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

                            GENNARO
          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

                            HAMMOND
          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in
          the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above
          the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!
          238 fabulous creatures so far!

                            TIMMY
          Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want
          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

                            HAMMOND
          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

                            ELLIE
          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

                            HAMMOND
          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

                            GRANT
          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

                            HAMMOND
          Yes ... there is.


INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

                            HAMMOND
          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

                            HAMMOND
          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

                            HAMMOND
          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

                            ELLIE
              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

                     
       HAMMOND
          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

                            NEDRY
          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

                            ARNOLD
          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

                            NEDRY
          Right.


BACK ON HALLWAY -

Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

                            TIMMY
          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

                  
          HAMMOND
          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION

Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

                            LEX
          It's ... gold!

                            TIMMY
          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

                            LEX
          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

                            HAMMOND
          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

                            GRANT
          Like mosquitos -

                            HAMMOND
          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
        
  material?  My God!  It just might work.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY

A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

                            HAMMOND
          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

                            GRANT
          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

                            LEX
          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

                            ELLIE
          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

                            HAMMOND
          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

                            GRANT
          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

                 
           HAMMOND
          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


INT  GENETICS ROOM

A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

                            HAMMOND
          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

                            WU
          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

                            WU
          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

                            HAMMOND
          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

                            WU
          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

                            WU
          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY

A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

                            GRANT
          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

                            WU
          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

                            HAMMOND
          Our primordial soup.

                            GRANT
          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

                            WU
          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

                            GENNARO
          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

                            LEX
          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

                            WU
          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

                            WU
          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

                            LEX
          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

                            WU
          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

                            GRANT
          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

                   
         WU
          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

                            GRANT
          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

                            WU
          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

                            WU
          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

                            HAMMOND
          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

                            GENNARO
          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

                            ELLIE
          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

                            GENNARO
          How do you mean?

                            ELLIE
          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


EXT  TOUR START - DAY

The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

                            REGIS
          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

                            GENNARO
          Looks like rain to me.

         
                   REGIS
          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

                            HAMMOND
          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

                            GRANT
          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now
          entering the lost world of the
          prehistoric past, a world of mighty
          creatures long gone from the face of the
          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)
          That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no
          expense.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          We'll begin our tour today with the
          herbivores ...


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY

Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

                            REGIS
          Look ...

                            LEX AND TIMMY
          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

                            REGIS
          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

                            GRANT
          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

                            REGIS
          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

                            ELLIE
          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

                            GENNARO
          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

                            HAMMOND
          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh, balls.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY

The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

                            GRANT
          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

                            ELLIE
          What to you mean?

                            GRANT
          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

                            ALL THREE
          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

                            GENNARO
          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

                            GRANT
              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

                            ELLIE
          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

                            ELLIE
          Are we dreaming all this?


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY

A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

               
             MULDOON
          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

                            HAMMOND
          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

                            MULDOON
          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

                            MULDOON
          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
         
 We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

                            HAMMOND
          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

                            MULDOON
          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

                            HAMMOND
          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

                            ARNOLD
          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

                            HAMMOND
          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

                            RADIO
 
         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

                            RADIO
          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

                            NEDRY
          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

                            HAMMOND
          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

                 
           RADIO
          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

                            LEX
          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

                            VET
          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

                            REGIS
          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

                            GRANT
          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

                            ELLIE
          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

                            LEX
          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

                            HARDING
          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

                            ELLIE
          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

                            HARDING
          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

                            ELLIE
          West Indian Lilacs!

                            GRANT
          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

                            HARDING
          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

                            GRANT
          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

                            ELLIE
          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

                            HARDING
          I don't get it.

                            GRANT
          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

                            ELLIE
          So, she poisons herself periodically.

                            HARDING
          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

                            GRANT
          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

                            LEX
          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

                            GENNARO
          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

                            ELLIE
          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

                            GRANT
          Soil samples?

                            ELLIE
          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

        
                    GRANT
          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK

The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

                            TOUR
          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
          Where is the T-
Rex?

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

                            GRANT
          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

                            GRANT
          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


BACK ON CONTRO
L ROOM -

Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

                            MULDOON
          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

                            HAMMOND
          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

                            MULDOON
          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -

Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

                            LEX
          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

                            GRANT
          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

                            REGIS
          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

                            RECORDED VOICE
          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

                            LEX
          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

                            GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
          What is a carnivore got out?

                            GRANT (MONITORED)
          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

                            HAMMOND
          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

                            ARNOLD
          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

                            HAMMOND
          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

                            ARNOLD
          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

                            ARNOLD
          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

                            HAMMOND
          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

                            NEDRY
          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

CLOSE ON 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT

The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

                            LEX
          Hey, is that bathroom working?

                            REGIS
          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

                            GRANT
          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

                            REGIS
          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Nedry yawns loudly.

                            NEDRY
          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

                            HAMMOND
          Slob!

                            ARNOLD
          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT

Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

                            REGIS
          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

                            REGIS
          No, darling, of course not.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

                            REGIS
          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

                            NEDRY
          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

                            HAMMOND
          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

                            ARNOLD
          That's not the worst of it.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

                            WU
          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

                            HAMMOND
          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

                            MULDOON
          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

     
                       HAMMOND
          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


INT  GARAGE - NIGHT

Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

                            NEDRY
          Oh, shit!


INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -

Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT

Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


BACK ON GARAGE

Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

                            MULDOON
          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

                            ELLIE
          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


EXT  DOCK - NIGHT

Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

                            NEDRY
          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
       
   nobody could land on the water.

                            NEDRY
              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

                            NEDRY
              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

                            NEDRY
          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

                            NEDRY
          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

                            NEDRY
          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

                            TIMMY
          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

                            TIMMY
          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

                            REGIS
          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

                            TIMMY
          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

                            LEX
          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX
          They have one of those things from the
          room with all the eggs - you know, where
          they help the baby eggs grow up.

                            TIMMY
          You mean an incubator?

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          What's the commotion?

                            REGIS
          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

                            TIMMY
          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX (TO WALKIE)
          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

                            GRANT
          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

                            GENNARO
          When's the damn power coming on?


INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS

Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

                            MULDOON
          Strong legs.

                            ELLIE
          Lot of track in college.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

 
                           LEX
          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

                            REGIS
          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

                            REGIS
          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

                            LEX
          Feels like a vibration.


INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


BACK ON CRUISE
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER

There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


CLOSE ON LEX -

Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

                            REGIS
          Jesus Christ.

                            LEX
          Bad language.

     
                       REGIS
          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't
          electrified.

                            LEX
          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

                            TIM
          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

                            LEX
          He just left us.  He just left us all
          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


TIMMY REACHES -

out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


BACK ON GRANT -

He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

                            GENNARO
          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

                            GRANT
        
  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


BACK ON TIM -

He watches the beast move.


BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -

As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

                            GRANT
          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


IN THE FIRST CRUISER -

Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

                            LEX
          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -

The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


ON TIM -

He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

                            LEX
          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


GRANT -

watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


TIMMY AND LEX -

have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

                            TIMMY
          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

                            TIMMY
              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



GRANT DANCES -

with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

                            GENNARO
          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


GRANT RUNS BA
CK -

to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

                            LEX (OFF)
          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

                            GRANT
          Lex, are you okay?

                            LEX
          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

                            LEX
          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

                            GRANT
          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
FLASHES.


EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -

Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

                            NEDRY
          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

                            NEDRY
          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
- HOOT!

Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

                            NEDRY
          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

                            NEDRY
          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER

Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION

Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Timmy.  Are you ok?

                            TIMMY
          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

                            GRANT
          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

                            GRANT
          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

                            GRANT
          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

                            GRANT
          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

                            TIMMY
          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

                            GRANT
          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

                            TIMMY
          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


INT  DRAINPIPE -

Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

ON THE HILLSIDE -

Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

                            GRANT
          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

                            TIMMY
          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

                            TIMMY
          I found your baseball.

                            LEX
          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

                            GRANT
          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

                            LEX
          I'm afraid of the "animals".

                            TIMMY
          The "animals" are gone.

                            LEX
          Where did it go?

                            TIMMY
          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

                            LEX
          Are there any grownups out there?

                            GRANT
          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

                            LEX
          I'm hungry.

                            GRANT
          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


EXT  ROADSIDE

Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

                            REGIS
          Noooooo!


BACK ON HILLSIDE -

Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

                            GRANT
          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

                            REGIS
    
      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -

Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

                            ELLIE
          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

                            MULDOON
          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

                            MULDOON
          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

                            MULDOON
          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

                            ELLIE
          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

                            MULDOON
          Perhaps.

                            ELLIE
          No!  They're out there.

                            MULDOON
          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

                            MULDOON
          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

                            MULDOON
          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

                            ELLIE
          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

                            MULDOON
          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

                            ELLIE
          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

                            WU
          Why?

                            ARNOLD
          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

              
              WU
          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

                            ARNOLD
          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

                            WU
          What's that?

                            ARNOLD
          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
PERIM
ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

                            WU
          What's it mean?

                            ARNOLD
          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

                            WU
          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

                            MULDOON
          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
    
      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure you'll find them.

                            MULDOON
          I certainly hope so.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

                            MULDOON
          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

                            HAMMOND
          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

                            GENNARO
          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

                            HARDING
          He's had a lot of morphine.

                            GENNARO
              (sings)
          Not enough.

                            ELLIE
          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

                            HARDING
          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

                            GENNARO
          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT

The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:


INT  STATEROOM -

The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


EXT  PARK - NIGHT

Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

                            LEX
          I'm tired.

                            TIMMY
          You're too big to be carried.

                            LEX
          But I'm tired-tired.

                            GRANT
          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

                            GRANT
          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

                            GRANT
          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          The fence.

                            GRANT
              (squinting)
          No.

                            TIMMY
          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

                            LEX
          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

                            TIMMY
          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

                   
         GRANT
          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

                            LEX
              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

                            GRANT
          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

                             TIM
          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

                            GRANT
          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

                            TIM
          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

                            GRANT
          Up there.

                            TIM
          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE

Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

                            TIMMY
              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

                            WU
          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

                            ELLIE
          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

                            WU
          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many
          viruses 
in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

                            ELLIE
          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

                            WU
          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

                            MULDOON
          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

                            MULDOON
          That's what?

                            ARNOL
D
          I found the command to restore the
          original code.  It resets the linked
          parameters.

                            MULDOON
          The fences and the power?

                            ARNOLD
          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

                            MULDOON
          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

                            ARNOLD
          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

                            ARNOLD
          Hot damn!

                            MULDOON
          Are the fences back on?

                            ARNOLD
          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

                            MULDOON
          Motion sensors?

                            ARNOLD
          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          Just hiss.


BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -

Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

                            MULDOON
          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

                            ARNOLD
          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

                            ARNOLD
          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

                            MULDOON
          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide
.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

                            WU
          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

                            WU
          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as
the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean.


INT  STATEROOM, ANNE B 
-

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

                                                      CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN

Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN

CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

                            LEX
          He gonna eat us?

                            GRANT
          I don't think so.  She's a ...

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!

The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

                            LEX
          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

                            GRANT
          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

                            MULDOON
          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

                            MULDOON
          Let's see what's up.


EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING

Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

                            GRANT
          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

                            TIM
          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

           
                 LEX
          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

                            TIM
          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

                            LEX
          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

                            LEX
          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

                            LEX
          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

                 
           GRANT
          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

                            LEX
          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

                            GRANT
          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

                            LEX
          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

                            GRANT
          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

                            MULDOON
          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

                            BEARDED WORKE
R (OFF)
          I found him!

                            BALD WORKER (OFF)
          Found him!


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

                            HAMMOND
          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

                            HAMMOND
          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
    
      as we speak.

                            GENNARO
          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

                            HAMMOND
          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

                            HAMMOND
          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

                            HAMMOND
          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

                            HAMMOND
          Wu says he can make a foot high
    
      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living
          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

                            HARDING
          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
          He's doped to infinity and back.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

                            WU
          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

                            ELLIE
          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

                            WU
          That's absurd.

                            ELLIE
          These bones aren't fully formed.

                            WU
          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

                            Y
          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

                            WU
          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

                            ELLIE
          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

                            HAMMOND (OFF)
          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

                            WU
          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

                            HAMMOND
          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

                            WU
          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

                            HAMMOND
          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

                            HAMMOND
          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY


Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


INT CONTROL - DAY

Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

                            ELLIE
          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

                            ARNOLD
          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

                            ELLIE
          Find what?

                            ARNOLD
          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

                            WU
          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

                            ARNOLD
          Shut the system down?

                            WU
          And reset.

                            ARNOLD
          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

                            ELLIE
          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

                            ELLIE
          Well?

                            ARNOLD
          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

                            ELLIE
          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

                            ARNOLD
          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

                            ELLIE
          How long do we have to wait?

                            ARNOLD
          Thirty seconds.


EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -

Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

                            GRANT
          What is it?

                            LEX
          I hear something.

                            GRANT
          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

                            LEX
          Hear it now?

                            TIMMY
          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

                            GRANT
          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

                            LEX
          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

                            ARNOLD
          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

                            ARNOLD
          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

                            ELLIE
          What's wrong?

                            ARNOLD
          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

                            ARNOLD
          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold!  They're still not working.

                            ARNOLD
          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

                            WU
              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

                            ELLIE
          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be -

                    
        HAMMOND
          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

                            ELLIE
          What's happening?

                            ARNOLD
              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

                            WU
          My good God.

                            ELLIE
          What?

                            ARNOLD
          It's the Rex ...

                            HAMMOND
          They've stampeded ...


BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -

Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

CLOSE ON
 - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

                            TIMMY
          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

                            HAMMOND
          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

                            HAMMOND
          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

                            MUL
DOON
          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY

The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

                            LEX
          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

                            TIMMY
          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

                            LEX
          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

                            GRANT
          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

                            LEX
          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

                            GRANT
          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

                            LEX

          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

                            GRANT
          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

                            TIMMY
          Let's do it.


INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -

Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

                            GRANT
          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

                            TIMMY
          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

                            GRANT
          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

                            LEX
          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

                            GRANT
          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

                            LEX
          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

                            GRANT
          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

                            TIMMY
          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

                            TIMM
Y
          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

                            GRANT
          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -

Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

                            GRANT
          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -

Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

                            LEX
          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

                            LEX
          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

                            GRANT
          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

                            LEX
          You can't sleep.

                            GRANT
              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

                            LEX
          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

                            TIMMY
          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


A BEND IN THE RIVER -

Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

                            TIMMY
          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


ANOTHER BEND -

Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          Thought
 is looked calm?

                            GRANT
          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

                            GRANT
          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

                            TIMMY
          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

                            TIMMY
          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

               
             TIMMY
          You can do it!

                            GRANT
          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

                            GRANT
          No!!!!!

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

                            MULDOON
          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

                            HAMMOND
          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

                            MULDOON
          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

                            WU
          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

                            ELLIE
          You running on auxiliary power?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm not.

                            WU
          Looks like you are.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be.

                            WU
          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

                            HAMMOND
          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

                            HAMMOND
          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

                            HAMMOND
          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

                            ARNOLD
          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -

Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

                            LEX
          The waterfall stopped.

                            TIMMY
          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

                            GRANT
          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

                            GRANT
          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


BACK ON CON
TROL ROOM -

Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

                            HAMMOND
          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

                            WU
          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

                            WU
          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER

                            MULDOON
          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

                            ARNOLD
          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

                            MULDOON
          All of the fences?

                            ARNOLD
          Yes.

                            MULDOON
          Including the velociraptor mesh?

                            ARNOLD
              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

                            HAMMOND
          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm afraid so.

                            MULDOON
          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

                            HAMMOND
          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON

Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

                            ARNOLD
          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

           
                 MULDOON
          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

                            MULDOON
          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON

Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

                            MULDOON
          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

                            HAMMOND
          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

                            ELLIE
          Wait.  What about Arnold?


EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -

Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

                            TIMMY
          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON

Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

                            GRANT
          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

                            TIM
          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
   
       one.


EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

                            MULDOON
          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

                            MULDOON
          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

                            ELLIE
          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

                            MULDOON
          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

                            WU
          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

                            ELLIE
          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE

The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


INT  GE
NERATOR BUILDING -

Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

                            ELLIE
          Damn, I banged my head.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

                            ELLIE
          One -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Two -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


BACK ON LEX -

She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!

The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

                            LEX
          We did it!

                            TIM
          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


BACK ON ELLIE -

The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

                            ELLIE
          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

                            WU
          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

                            ELLIE
          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

                            ELLIE
          They're coming inside!

                            WU
          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

                            MULDOON
          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

                            MULDOON
          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

                            ELLIE
          Why didn't the power go on?

                            MULDOON
          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -

Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

                            LEX
          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

                            GRANT
          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

                            GRANT
          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

                            LEX
          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

                            GRANT
          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

                 
           TIMMY
          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

                            GRANT
          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

                            LEX
          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

                            TIMMY
          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

                            GRANT
          Be right back.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

                            MULDOON
          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY

The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


INT  STATEROOM -

The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

                            LEX
          Any candy behind the counter?

                            TIMMY
          Hungry?

                            LEX
          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

                            TIMMY
          Nothing.

                            LEX
          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant said -

                            LEX
          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

                            TIMMY
          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

                            TIMMY
          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

                            LEX
          Where are we going?

                            TIM
          The kitchen!


INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

                            ELLIE
          How long?

                            MULDOON
          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

                            ELLIE
          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

                            GRANT
          Ellie, I'm go glad -

                            ELLIE
          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

                            TIMMY
          We'll freeze to death in there.

                            LEX
          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

                            TIMMY
          PUSH!

The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

                            LEX
          What is it, Timmy?

                            TIMMY
          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


INT  GIFT SHOP -

Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -

The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


INT  GENETICS ROOM -

The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

                            GRANT
          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

                            TIMMY
          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

                            GRANT
          Ok good, you're elected.


INT  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te
ll Timmy how to reboot?

                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

                            GRANT
          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

          Are they going to be ok?

                            GRANT
          If we can get help very soon.

                            TIMMY
          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
SYSTEMS NORMAL.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          Ok, we're all right here for now.
      
    Thanks.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

                            TIM
          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

                            GRANT
          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

                            RADIO
          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

                            GRANT
          Report your position!

                            RADIO
          Ah, we're just about to dock here in
          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please
          identify yourself.

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F
REDERICK D. (CAPT.)
Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.

                            GRANT
          Try this for identification, Captain
          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen
          biological materials.  If you don't turn
          that boat around and return to Isla
          Nublar immediately with your contraband
          cargo, you will be found in violation of
          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,
          you will be subject to revocation of
          license, penalties in excess of fifty
          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.
          Do you copy?

SILENCE.

                            GRANT
          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

                            RADIO
          I copy.  All ahead stern.

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

                            TIMMY
          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

                     
       GRANT
          Who the hell knows?

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

                            LEX
          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

                            GRANT
          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


INT ROTUNDA -

With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

                            GRANT
              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK

Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

              
              HAMMOND
          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful
          place.  I need a man just like you to
          help me get my park back on its feet
          again.  And it will be on its feet again.

                            GRANT
          We have to leave now.

Hammond stops.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't you see I've exalted human
          potential here?  You must see it.  You
          must feel it.  I called back a life form.
          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just
          that - let the others go, if they want.

                            GRANT
          You interrupted natural law.  There are
          regulations,
 rules that nature follows
          that make her knowable.

                            HAMMOND
          You mean there are rules that nature
          follows that create barriers to our
          knowledge.

                            GRANT
          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth
          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

                            HAMMOND
          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

                            GRANT
          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

                            GRANT
          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

                            HAMMOND
          I created genetic miracles!

                            GRANT
          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

                            HAMMOND
          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

                            GRANT
          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
          
                            HAMMOND
          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

                            GRANT
          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


IN THE COPTER -

SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

                            ELLIE
          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

                            GRANT
          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

                            ELLIE
          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

                            GRANT
   
       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

                            ELLIE
          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR

Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

CAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES
INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.

                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT

The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

                                                      FADE OUT.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Let's see.  Target left work at

					SCREEN
			Trace program:  running.

	The entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
	Shimmering like green-electric rivets, they rush at a 10-
	digit phone number in the top corner.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			He caught the northbound Howard 
			line. Got off at Sheridan.  
			Stopped at 7-11.  Purchased six-
			pack of beer and a box of Captain 
			Crunch.  Returned home.

	The area code is identified.  The first three numbers
	suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

	We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each 
	digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like
	the wheels of a slot machine.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			All right, you're relieved.  Use

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I think Morpheus knows things that

			Yeah, but if he's wrong --

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I better go.

					CYPHER (V.O.) 
			Yeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.

	She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
	netherworld of the computer screen.

	Where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around 
	us.

			Attention all units.  Attention

	Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
	ourselves in --


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

	The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way 
	across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms 
	as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving 
	patterns of permanent shadow.

	We FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as 
	they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
	on either side of room 303.

	The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --

	The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
	them.

					BIG COP
			Police!  Freeze!

	The room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold-
	up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook 
	computer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the
	computer.

	Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is 
	TRINITY; a woman in black leather.

					BIG COP
			Get your hands behind your head!

	Trinity rises.

					BIG COP
			Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do
			it!

	She slowly puts her hands behind her head.


	EXT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

	A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the 
	police cruisers.

	AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.

	They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They 
	are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones 
	in one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt
	collars.

					AGENT SMITH
			Lieutenant?

					LIEUTENANT
			Oh shit.

					AGENT SMITH 
			Lieutenant, you were given 
			specific orders --

					LIEUTENANT
			I'm just doing my job.  You gimme

			can cran it up your ass.

					AGENT SMITH
			The orders were for your protection.

	The Lieutenant laughs.

					LIEUTENANT
			I think we can handle one little
			girl.

	Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
	hotel.

					LIEUTENANT
			I sent two units.  They're 
			bringing her down now.

					AGENT SMITH
			No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL

	The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding 
	a bead.  They've done this a hundred times, they know 
	they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuff 
	and Trinity moves --

	It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly 
	fast.

	The eye blinks and Trinity's palm. snaps up and the nose 
	explodes, blood erupting.  The cop is dead before he
	begins to fall.

	And Trinity is moving again --

	Seizing a wrist, misdirecting a gun, as a startled cop 
	FIRES --

	A head explodes.

	In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed 
	black hole --

	And FIRES --

	Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she 
	reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.

	The cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his 
	windpipe, killing the scream as he falls to the ground.

	She looks at the four bodies.

			Shit.

	Agent Brown enters the hotel, while Agent Smith heads for

			Goddamnit!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			You have to focus.  There is a

	She takes a deep breath, centering herself.

					TRINITY
			All right --

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go.

	She drops the phone.


	INT.  HALL

	She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall,
	leading another unit of police.  Trinity races to the 
	opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the 
	fire escape.


	EXT.  FIRE E5CAPE

	In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at 
	her.  She can only go up.


	EXT.  ROOF

	On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over 
	the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.

	Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her 
	moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
	contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.

	Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.

	The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity 
	turns to it, racing for the back of the building.

	The edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next 
	building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is 
	perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other 
	roof.

	The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something 
	ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself 
	into the air.

	From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
	hangs in flight

	Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.

					COP
			Motherfucker -- that's impossible!

	They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the 
	move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto 
	one knee.

	Just below the building are the runbling tracks of 
	riveted steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a 
	rattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing
	easily.

	She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air 
	barely reaching the last car

	Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.

	Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.

	Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point 
	where the train has begun to turn, there is --

	A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
	building.

	Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her 
	speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL 
	rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
	turn.

	Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body 
	leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head
	as --

	The whole world seems to spin on its axis --

	And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then 
	falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
	stairs bleeding, broken --

	But still alive.

	Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,
	still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the
	wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train 
	slides him past the window.

	Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.

					TRINITY
			Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.
			Get up -- just get up!

	She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.


	EXT.  STREET

	Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the 
	end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
	sees it.

	The telephone booth.

	Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
	focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
	begins to RING.

	Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its 
	TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.

	Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the
	telephone booth as if taking aim.

	Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --

	Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly
	bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

	She answers the phone.

	There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
	mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --

	Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
	wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.

	After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
	the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
	There is no body.  Trinity is gone.

	His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
	AGENT JONES walks up behind him.

					AGENT SMITH
			Did you get anything from the
			room?

					AGENT JONES
			Their next target.  The name is
			Neo.

	The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground,
	separated in the crash like a severed limb.

					AGENT SMITH
			We'll need a search running.

					AGENT JONES
			It's already begun.

	We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER 
	and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
	like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall
	through one --

	Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --

	A computer screen.

	We are on-line, inside a chat room called "The Matrix." 
	It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.

					SCREEN
			JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been
			on this board.
			SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even
			exist and the Matrix is nothing 
			but an advertising gimmick 4 a new
			game.
			TIMAXE:  All I want to know is
			Trinity really a girl?
			LODIII:  87% of all women on line
			are really men.
			QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism 
			for the government.
			SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the
			system controlling our lives.
			TIMAXE:  You mean MTV.
			SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega.
			FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!

	We drift back from the electric conversation entering --


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	It is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with
	technology.

	Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into
	thickets that wind up and around the legs of several
	desks.

	Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay
	open like an autopsied corpse.

	We turn towards the center of this rat-nest of
	technology, following the slurping and crunching of
	cereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --

	NEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a 
	computer than living outside one.

					NEO
			Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.

	He finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an 
	anonynous message slices onto the screen.

					SCREEN
			Do you want to know what the
			Matrix is, Neo?

	Neo is frozen when he reads his name.

					SCREEN
			SUPERASTIC:  Who said that?
			JACKON:  Who's Neo?
			GIBSON:  This is a private board.

			If you want to know, follow the
			white rabbit.

					NEO
			What the hell...

					SCREEN
			TIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the
			hackers!
			FOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!!
			JACKON:  Identify yourself.

			Knock, knock, Neo.

	A chill runs down his spine and when someone KNOCKS on
	his door he almost jumps out of his chair.

	He looks at the door, then back at the computer but the
	message is gone.

	He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
	Again, someone knocks.

	Cautiously, Neo approaches the door.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Hey, Tommy-boy!  You in there?

	Recognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it.  ANTHONY,
	who lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group
	of friends.

					NEO
			What do you want, Anthony?

					ANTHONY
			I need your help, man.  Desperate.
			They got me, man.  The shackles of 
			fascism.

	He holds up the red notice that accompanies the Denver
	boot.

					NEO
			You got the money this time?

	He holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door.
	Anthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.

					DUJOUR
			You can really get that thing off,
			right now?

					ANTHONY
			I told you, honey, he may look 
			like just another geek but this 
			here is all we got left standing 
			between Big Brother and the New
			World Order.


	EXT.  STREET

	A police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the
	wheel of an enormous oldsmobile.


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	They watch from the window as the cops, silently,
	robotically, climb into their van.

					ANTHONY
			Look at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't 
			think about what they're- doing or
			why.  Computer tells 'em what to
			do and they do it.

					FRIEND #l
			Thc banality of evil.

	He slaps the money in Neo's hand.

					ANTHONY
			Thanks, neighbor.

					DUJOUR
			Why don't you come to the party
			with us?

					NEO
			I don't know.  I have to work
			tomorrow.

					DUJOUR
			Come on.  It'll be fun.

	He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
	leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands,
	symbols, slogans, military medals and --

	A small white rabbit.

	The ROOM TILTS.

					NEO
			Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.


	INT.  APARTMENT

	An older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a 
	chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy
	casements.

	Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there 
	are.

	Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
	gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
	jungle cats around a tree.

	Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle
	of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
	leave when he notices a woman staring at him.

	The woman is Trinity.  She walks straight up to him.

	In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
	each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.

					TRINITY
			Hello, Neo.

					NEO
			How did you know that --

					TRINITY
			I know a lot about you.  I've been
			wanting to meet you for some time.

					NEO
			Who are you?

					TRINITY
			My name is Trinity.

					NEO
			Trinity?  The Trinity?  The
			Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
			Kansas City D-Base?

					TRINITY
			That was a long time ago.

					NEO
			Gee-zus.

					TRINITY
			What?

					NEO
			I just thought... you were a guy.

					TRINITY
			Most guys do.

	Neo is a little embarrassed.

					NEO
			Do you want to go sorewhere and
			talk?

					TRINITY
			No.  It's safe here and I don't
			have much time.

	The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking
	directly into each other's ear.

					NEO
			That was you on the board tonight.
			That was your note, wasn't it?

					TRINITY
			I had to gamble that you would see
			and they wouldn't.

					NEO
			Who wouldn't?

					TRINITY
			I can't explain everything to you.
			I'm sure that it's all going to
			seem very strange, but I brought
			you here to warn you, Neo.  You
			are in a lot of danger.

					NEO
			What?  Why?

					TRINITY
			They're watching you.  Something
			happened and they found out about
			you.  Normally, if our target is
			exposed we let it go.  But this
			time, we can't do that.

					NEO
			I don't understand --

					TRINITY
			You came here because you wanted
			to know the answer to a hacker's
			question.

					NEO
			The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?

					TRINITY
			Twelve years ago I met a man, a
			great man, who said that no one
			could be told the answer to that
			question.  That they had to see
			it, to believe it.

	Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.

					TRINITY
			He told me that no one should look
			for the answer unless they have to
			because once you see it,
			everything changes.  Your life and
			the world you live in will never
			be the same.  It's as if you wake
			up one morning and the sky is
			falling.

	There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
	the words like a drug, seeping into him.

					TRINITY
			The truth is out there, Neo.  It's
			looking for you and it will find
			you, if you want it to.

	She takes hold of him with her eyes.

					TRINITY
			That's all I can tell you right
			now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good
			luck.

					NEO
			Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the
			man?

	She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she
	whispers.

					TRINITY
			You know who.

	She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
	of bodies.

	A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,
	pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --

							CUT TO:


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to
	consciousness.  He strains to read the clock face:
	9:15 A.M.

					NEO
			Shitshitshit.


	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

	The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development
	company.


	INT.  CORTECHS OFFICE

	The main offices are along each wall, the windows
	overlooking downtown Chicago.

	RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo
	without looking at him, typing at his computer
	continuously.

	Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
	outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the
	surface of the glass.

					RHINEHEART
			You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.
			You think that you're special.
			You believe that somehow the rules
			do not apply to you.

	He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in
	time.

					RHINEHEART
			Obviously, you are mistaken.

	His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.

					RHINEHEART
			This company is one of the top
			software companies in the world
			because every single employee
			understands that they are a part
			of a whole.  Thus, if an employee
			has a problem, the company has a
			problem.

	He turns again.

					RHINEHEART
			The time has come to make a 
			choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you
			choose to be at your desk on time
			from this day forth, or you choose
			to find yourself another job.  Do
			I make myself clear?

					NEO
			Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly
			clear.

	INT.  NEO'S CUBICLE

	The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a
	labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
	elevators.

	Neo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands
	up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.

					TALL EMPLOYEE
			What did he say?

					NEO
			If I was late again, I'm going to
			be fired.

	He smirks.

					TALL EMPLOYEE
			Well, it was nice working with
			you.

	Neo glares at him, as he sinks down.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Thomas Anderson?

	Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle
	door.

					NEO
			Yeah.  That's me.

	Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him
	the softpak.

					FEDEX
			Have a nice day.

	He opens the bag.  Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE.  It seems
	the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS.  Unnerved, he
	flips it open.

					NEO
			Hello?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus.

	Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I had hoped for this conversation
			to take place under less adverse
			conditions, but you can never
			count on hope, can you, Neo?

					NEO
			... no.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I've been watching you, Neo, and I
			want to meet you.  I don't know if
			you're ready to see what I want to
			show you, but unfortunately, we
			have run out of time.  They're
			coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not
			sure what they're going to do.

					NEO
			Who's coming for me?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stand up and see for yourself.

					NEO
			Right now?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.  Now.

	Neo starts to stand.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.

	His head slowly peeks up over the partition.

	At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones
	leading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and
	points out Neo's cubicle.

	Neo ducks.

					NEO
			Holy fuckin' shit!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.

	One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the
	agents.

					NEO
			What the fuck do they want with
			me?!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I'm not sure.  But, if you don't
			want to find out, you better get
			out of there.

					NEO
			How?!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I can guide you out, but you have
			to do exactly what I say.

	The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The cubicle across from you is
			empty.

					NEO
			But what if...?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go!  Now!

	Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
	just as the agents turn into his row.

	Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
	tightly to him.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stay here for a moment.

	The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to
	search the bathroom.

	Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			A little longer...

	Brown is talking to the tall employee.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			When I tell you, go to the end of
			the row to the first office on the
			left, stay.as low as you can.

	Sweat trickles down his forehead.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Now.

	Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he
	freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.

	Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING
	across the opening to the first office on the left.

	The room is empty.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Good.  Now there is a window.
			Open it.

					NEO
			How do you know all this?

	Morpheus laughs quietly.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The answer is coming, Neo.

	He opens the window.  The window howls into the room.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Outside, there's a scaffold.  You
			can use it to get to the roof.

	Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is
	several offices away.

					NEO
			No! It's too far away.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			There's a small ledge.  It's a
			short climb.  You can make it.

	Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a
	concrete chasm.

					NEO
			No way, no way, this is crazy.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Don't be controlled by your fear,
			Neo.  There are only two ways out
			of this building.  One is that
			scaffold.  The other is in their
			custody.  You take a chance either
			way.  I leave it to you.

	CLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at
	the scaffold.

					NEO
			This is insane!  Why is this
			happening to me?  What did I do?
			I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.
			Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!

	He climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the
	frame, he steps onto the small ledge.

	The scaffold seems even farther away.

					NEO
			I'm going to die.

	The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
	knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to
	the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.

	He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.

					NEO
			This is insane.  I can't do this!
			Forget it!

	He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
	door.

					NEO
			I didn't do anything!


	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

	The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving
	doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the
	dark sedan.

	Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her
	motorcycle.

					TRINITY
			Shit.

	INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR

	A wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at
	a table alone.

	We MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the
	monitor were a window.

	At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.

	Smith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila envelope
	slaps down on the table between them.

	Neo glances at the name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas 
	A."

					AGENT SMITH
			As you can see, we've had our eye
			on you for some time now, Mr.
			Anderson.

	He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
	flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at
	the file or at him.

					AGENT SMITH
			It seems that you have been living
			two lives.  In one life, you are
			Thomas A. Anderson, program writer
			for a respectable software
			company.  You have a social
			security number, you pay your
			taxes and you help your land lady
			carry out her garbage.

	The pages continue to turn.

					AGENT SMITH
			The other life is lived in
			computers where you go by the
			hacker alias Neo, and are guilty
			of virtually every computer crime
			we have a law for, including the
			unauthorized use of the D.M.V.
			system for the removal of
			automobile boots.

	Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

					AGENT SMITH
			One of these,lives has a future.
			One of them does not.

	He closes the file.

					AGENT SMITH
			I'm going to be as forthcoming as
			I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are
			here because we need your help.

	He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice-
	blue.

					AGENT SMITH
			We know that you have been
			contacted by a certain individual.
			A man who calls himself Morpheus.
			Whatever you think you know about
			this man is irrelevant to the fact
			that he is wanted for acts of
			terrorism in more countries than
			any other man in the world.  He is
			considered by many authorities to
			be the most dangerous man alive.

	He leans closer.

					AGENT SMITH
			My colleagues believe that I am
			wasting my time with you, but I
			believe you want to do the right
			thing.  It is obvious that you are
			an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,
			and that you are interested in the
			future.  That is why I believe you
			are ready to put your past
			mistakes behind you and get on
			with your life.

	Neo tries to match his stare.

					AGENT SMITH
			We are willing to wipe the slate
			clean, to give you a fresh start
			and all we are asking in return is
			your cooperation in bringing a
			known terrorist to justice.

	Neo nods to himself.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a
			real good deal.  But I think I
			have a better one.  How about I
			give you the finger --

	He does.

					NEO
			And you can cram that file up your
			Secret Service sphincter.

	Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.

					AGENT SMITH
			You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.

					NEO
			You ain't seen nothing yet.

					AGENT SMITH
			The irony of your situation is
			that you have no choice.

					NEO
			You can't scare me with this
			gestapo crap.  I know my rights.
			I want my phone call.

	Agent Smith smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what
			good is a phone call iy you are
			unable to speak?

	The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to
	feel the muscles in his jaw tighten.

	The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion
	grow into panic.

	Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
	seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his
	mouth is gone.

	Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents
	restrain him holding him in the chair.

					AGENT SMITH
			You are going to help us, Mr.
			Anderson, whether you want to or
			not.

	Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.

	From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a
	long, fiber-optic wire tap.

	Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
	his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the
	electronic device animates, become an organic creature
	that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

	Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into
	Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature
	which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

	Before it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it
	worms its way inside.


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.

	He realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth
	is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a
	deep, everything-is-okay breath, when --

	The PHONE RINGS.

	It almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING,
	building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,
	sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.

	He answers it, saying nothing.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.).
			This line is tapped, so I must be
			brief.

					NEO
			The agents --

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			They got to you first, but they've
			underestimated how important you
			are.  If they knew what I know,
			you would probably be dead.

	Neo feels sick.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I don't know what you are thinking
			right now but I want you to
			understand that I will not give up
			on you until you give up on me.

	Neo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do you still want to meet?

					NEO
			... Yes.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Take the Howard line south.

	CLICK.  He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.


	EXT.  EL TRAIN

	An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.


	INT.  TRAIN

	It is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban
	night crawlers.  Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching
	everything nervously.

	There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as
	the door is opened.

	Neo turns and sees a large man enter.  He is wearing
	sunglasses and a black leather jacket.  His name is APOC
	and he walks straight at Neo.

					APOC
			Come with me.

	Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and
	two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.

	Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There
	is no upcoming station.

	Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles
	against its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo
	slams against the metal rail.

	The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his
	balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --

	He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls
	from, the raised tracks --

	Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,
	a truck races under him and --

	He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty
	boxes.


	INT.  TRUCK BED

	Still shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone.  A
	man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him.  Trinity is
	next to him, talking into a cellular phone.

					TRINITY
			We got him.  Call the chop-shop.

	She hangs up.

					TRINITY
			Listen to me, Neo.  You have to,
			trust us.

	She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches
	for his face.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					TRINITY
			This has to be done for your
			protection and ours.

	She seals his eyes shut with the tape.

					TRINITY
			You can't understand right now,
			but if you're not one of us,
			you're one of them.


	EXT.  LOWER WACKER

	A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that
	curls down from the city's surface.

	trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps.  The back of
	the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who
	looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is
	a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.

	His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,
	exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking
	braces.

					GIZMO
			Va va va voom.  Still the hottest
			software around.

					TRINITY
			Hello, Gizmo.

	Neo hears the voices around him.

					GIZMO
			This is really the guy?  The guy
			that Morpheus thinks --

					TRINITY
			Yeah.

					GIZMO
			But he's so old.

					TRINITY
			Are you going to help us or aren't
			you?

					GIZMO
			Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top
			and let's get the hell outta here.

	Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron.  He
	shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.

	A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve
	over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the
	underworld.


	INT.  VAN

	The chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to
	meters and monitors.  There are shelves lined with
	medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,
	cleavers, and stainless steel clamps.

	Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening
	nervously as Gizmo gets to work.

					GIZMO
			Okay, first we take a little look
			under the hood.

	He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they
	blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising
	to varying levels of magnification.

					GIZMO
			You're going to feel a little
			prick.

	He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower
	abdomen.  The needles are wired to video monitors.
	Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					TRINITY
			We think you're bugged.  We can't
			take you to Morpheus until you're
			clean.

					GIZMO
			There it is.

	On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large
	intestines.

					GIZMO
			Hit him with 10 ccs of local.

	Hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic
	around Neols navel.

	Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum,
	Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick.  Typing into a
	calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the
	tip.

	On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end
	separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.

					GIZMO
			Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

	The claw snags hold of the bug.

					GIZMO
			Gotcha!

	But the bug reacts violently.  Neo screams as it wraps
	itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.

					GIZMO
			Shit.

					TRINITY
			What's happening?

					GIZMO
			I don't know.  They've never done
			that before.

	Neo writhes in pain.

					GIZMO
			Hold him down.

					NEO
			Jesus!  God!

					TRINITY
			Do something!

					GIZMO
			I got it!  Maybe we can stun it.

					TRINITY
			Are you crazy?  That will kill
			him.

	We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.

					GIZMO
			It'll work.  Come on, do it or
			Hacksaw will.

					NEO
			Do what?

	The instant he hears the word, he knows.

					TRINITY
			Clear.

					NEO
			Oh, shit --

	The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his
	chest.  Gizmo wrestles with the bug.

					GIZMO
			Hit him again!

	Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo
	yanks the speculum out.

					GIZMO
			Got it!

	Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe.
	She eases the tape off his eyes.

					TRINITY
			Neo, are you okay?

	He nods.

					TRINITY
			It's over.  We got it.

	Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire-
	tap.

					GIZMO
			Nasty little bugger, ain't it?


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

	The van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten
	hotel.  The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out.

					TRINITY
			Thanks for your help, Gizmo.

					GIZMO
			I just hope the man knows what
			he's doing.

	She nods then climbs out of the van.  Gizmo ogles the
	tight leather pants.

					GIZMO
			Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for
			a copy of that software.

	Trinity turns around.

					TRINITY
			Gizmo, you don't have the hardware
			to handle this software.

	He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away.
	Trinity turns to Neo.

					TRINITY
			Let's go.  He's waiting.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

	It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of
	urban maggotry.

	Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the
	thirteenth floor.  They stop outside room 1313.

					TRINITY
			This is it.

	Neo can hear his own heart pounding.

					TRINITY
			Let me give one piece of advice.
			Be honest.  He knows more than you
			can possibly imagine.


	INT.  ROOM 1313

	Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall
	windows veiled with decaying lace.  He turns and his
	smile lights up the room.

					MORPHEUS
			At last.

	He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
	behind circular mirrored glasses.

	He strides to Neo and they shake hands.

					MORPHEUS
			Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt
			have guessed, I am Morpheus.

					NEO
			It's an honor.

					MORPHEUS
			Please.  Come.  Sit.

	He nods to Trinity.

					MORPHEUS
			Thank you, Trinity.

	She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an
	adjacent room.

	They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-
	leather chairs.

					MORPHEUS
			I imagine, right now, you must be
			feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
			down the rabbit hole?

					NEO
			You could say that.

					MORPHEUS
			I can see it in your eyes.  You
			have the look of a man who accepts
			what he sees because he is
			expecting to wake up.

	A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.

					MORPHEUS
			Ironically, this is not far from
			the truth.  But I'm getting ahead
			of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,
			why are you here?

					NEO
			You're Morpheus, you're a legend.
			Most hackers would die to meet
			you.

					MORPHEUS
			Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we
			both know there's more to it than 
			that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?

					NEO
			No.

					MORPHEUS
			Why not?

					NEO
			Because I don't like the idea that
			I'm not in control of my life.

					MORPHEUS
			I know exactly what you mean.

	Again, that smile that could cut glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Let me tell you why you are here.
			You are here because you have the
			gift.

					NEO
			What gift?

					MORPHEUS
			I've watched you, Neo.  You do not
			use a computer like a tool.  You
			use it like it was part of
			yourself.  What you can do inside
			a computer is not normal.  I know.
			I've seen it.  What you do is
			magic.

	Neo shrugs.

					NEO
			It's not magic.

					MORPHEUS
			But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else
			would you describe what has been
			happening to you?

	He leans forward.

					MORPHEUS
			We are trained in this world to
			accept only what is rational and
			logical.  Have you ever wondered
			why?

	Neo shakes his head.

					MORPHEUS
			As children, we do not separate
			the possible from the impossible
			which is why the younger a mind is
			the easier it is to free while a
			mind like yours can be very
			difficult.

					NEO
			Free from what?

					MORPHEUS
			From the Matrix.

	Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of
	himself.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you want to know what it is,
			Neo?

	Neo swallows and nods his head.

					MORPHEUS
			It's that feeling you have had all
			your life.  That feeling that
			something was wrong with the
			world.  You don't know what it is
			but it's there, like a splinter in
			your mind, driving you mad,
			driving you to me.  But what is
			it?

	The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.

					MORPHEUS
			The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
			around us, here even in this room.
			You can see it out your window, or
			on your television.  You feel it
			when you go to work, or go to
			church or pay your taxes.  It is
			the world that has been pulled
			over your eyes to blind you from
			the truth.

					NEO
			What truth?

					MORPHEUS
			That you are a slave, Neo.  That
			you, like everyone else, was born
			into bondage...
			... kept inside a prison that you
			cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A
			prison for your mind.

	Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Unfortunately, no one can be told
			what the Matrix is.  You have to
			see it for yourself.

					NEO
			How?

					MORPHEUS
			Hold out your hands.

	In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.

					MORPHEUS
			This is your last chance.  After
			this, there is no going back.

	In his left, a blue pill.

					MORPHEUS
			You take the blue pill and the
			story ends.  You wake in your bed
			and you believe whatever you want
			to believe.

	The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.

					MORPHEUS
			You take the red pill and you stay
			in Wonderland and I show you how
			deep the rabbit-hole goes.

	Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the
	moisture growing in his palms.

					MORPHEUS
			Remember that all I am offering is
			the truth.  Nothing more.

	Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The
	Cheshire smile returns.

					MORPHEUS
			Follow me.

	He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
	high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green
	from the racks of monitors.

	Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.

					CYPHER
			Shit.

					TRINITY
			I knew he would.

	Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone
	away from, Neo.

					CYPHER
			Morpheus, I know what you believe
			but I think this is a mistake.
			We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm
			afraid he might pop.

					MORPHEUS
			Haven't I always told you, Cypher,
			not to let fear control your life.
			Apoc, are we on-line?

	Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.

					APOC
			Almost.

	He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex
	system of monitors, modules and drives.

					NEO
			Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen
			Virus.

					APOC
			That's right.

					MORPHEUS
			Neo, time is always against us.
			Will you take a seat there?

	In the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair
	is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.

					MORPHEUS
			I imagine you know sonething about
			virtual reality.

	Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode
	disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.

					NEO
			A little.

					MORPHEUS
			Tell me about it.

					NEO
			Essentially, it's a hardware
			system that uses an apparatus;
			headgear, gloves and whatever to
			make you feel that you are in a
			computer program.

					MORPHEUS
			If the virtual reality apparatus,
			as you called it, was wired to all
			of your senses and controlled them
			completely, would you be able to
			tell the difference between the
			virtual world and the real world?

					NEO
			You might not, no.

					MORPHEUS
			No, you wouldn't.

	Neo whispers to Trinity.

					NEO
			You did all this?

	She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.
	They are wired to an old hotel phone.

					MORPHEUS
			The pill you took is part of a
			trace program.  It's going to make
			things feel a bit strange.

	Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING
	on a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and
	twitch when he notices the mirror.

	Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
	webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
	mirror were becoming liquid.

					NEO
			Shit...

	Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent
	data.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.

	Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers
	disappear beneath the rippling surface.

	Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
	stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy
	stuck to his fingertips.

					NEO
			What is this?  Mescaline?

					MORPHEUS
			Just relax, Neo.

	The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,
	until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.

	With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes
	of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and
	fade.

	He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored
	icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running
	like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms
	where he sees his face reflected.

					NEO
			Uh-oh...

					TRINITY
			It's going into replication.

					MORPHEUS
			Apoc?

					APOC
			Still nothing.

	Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.

					MORPHEUS
			Tank, we're going to need the
			signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.

	The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up
	his arns like hundreds of insects.

					NEO
			It's cold.

	The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,
	tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
	mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.

					NEO
			It's all over me --

	Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.

					TRINITY
			I got a fibrillation!

					CYPHER
			I knew it, I knew it...

					MORPHEUS
			Shit!  Apoc?

	Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.

					APOC
			Targeting... almost there.

	An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.

					TRINITY
			He's going into arrest!

					CYPHER
			He's gonna pop!

					APOC
			Lock!  I got him!

					MORPHEUS
			Now, Tank now!

	His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a
	high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --

	It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to
	another computer --

	Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were
	pulled into the holes of the phone

	Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.


	INT.  POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY

	Floating in a womb-red amnion.

	His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.

	Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure
	his face.  Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs
	and cover his genitals.

	He is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the
	Jell-O but does not break the surface.

	Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red
	rubber coccon.

	Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at
	the thinning elastic shroud --

	Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he
	sucks for air.  Tearing himself free, he emerges from the
	cell.

	It is Neo.

	He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.
	Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.

	He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled
	with red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified
	like curdled milk.

	The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear
	to be grafted to his flesh.

	He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the
	back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial
	plugged and locked into the base of his skull.

	He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull
	off a finger.

	To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with
	red gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and
	motionless, he sees other human beings.

	Fanning out in a circle, there are more.  All connected
	to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing
	petal attached to a black metal stem.

	Above him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly
	forever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks
	out.

	The image assaults his mind.

	Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible
	heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an
	underwater abyss.

	His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the
	intensity of the vision.  The sound of the PLANT is like
	the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of
	Leviathan.

	Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away
	the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a
	new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.

	Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and
	pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.

	From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.

	He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.

	It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful
	housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems
	of hard and soft polymers.

	A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain
	as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired
	to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.

	At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens,
	disengaging.

	The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle
	and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull
	with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  The other
	connective hoses snap free and snake away as --

	The back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like
	an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo
	into a black hole.


	INT.  WASTE LINE

	The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls,
	sliding with the clot of gelatin.

	Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up
	through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of
	cellulite.

	Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the
	flow of waste.

	The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the
	belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside
	the sewer main line.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo
	onto the floor.

	Human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself
	looking straight at Morpheus.

	Trinity and Apoc.  And others, dressed in bizarre, high-
	tech combat gear.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			Welcome to the real world, Neo.

	Neo passes out.

									FADE TO BLACK.

	We have no sense of time.  We hear VOICES whispering.

					MAN (O.S.)
			Do you think Morpheus is right?
			Do you think he could be the One?

					WOMAN (O.S.)
			It doesn't matter now.  But if
			he's wrong...

	FADE IN:

	NEO'S POV

	Neo's eyes flutter open.  We see Trinity's face above us,
	angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.


	ANGLE ON NEO

					NEO
			... am I dead?

					TRINITY
			Far from it.

									FADE TO BLACK.


	FADE IN:


	ANGLE ON NEO

	He opens his eyes again, something tingling through him.
	He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of
	acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.

					DOZER
			He needs a lot of work.

					MORPHEUS
			I know.

	Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					MORPHEUS
			Your muscles have atrophied.
			We're rebuilding them.

	Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.

					NEO
			Why do my eyes hurt?

					MORPHEUS
			You've never used them before.

	Morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo.
	Neo lays back.

					MORPHEUS
			Rest, Neo.  The answers are
			coming.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  He is
	wearing a black tank top and shorts.

	He begins to examine himself.  There is a futuristic IV
	plugged into the jack in his forearm.  He pulls it out,
	staring at the grafted outlet.

	He feels his bald head.  His fingers find and explore the
	large outlet in the base of his skull.

	Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the
	door.

					NEO
			Morpheus, what's happened to me?
			What is this place?

					MORPHEUS
			More important than what is when?

					NEO
			When?

					MORPHEUS
			You believe the year is 1997 when
			in fact it is much closer to 2197.
			I can't say for certain what year
			it is because we honestly do not
			know.

	The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.

					NEO
			That's not possible.

					MORPHEUS
			I promised you the truth, Neo, and
			the truth is that the world you
			were living in was a lie.

					NEO
			How?

					MORPHEUS
			I'll show you.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Like a sleepwalker, Neo follows Morpheus through the ship.

					MORPHEUS
			This is my ship, the
			Nebuchadnezzar.  It's a
			hovercraft.  Small like a
			submarine.  It's dark.  It's
			cramped and cold.  But it's home.

	They climb a ladder up to the main deck.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Everyone is there.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the main deck.  You know
			most of my crew.

	Trinity smiles and nods.

					MORPHEUS
			The ones you don't know.  That's
			Mouse and Switch.  The two big
			guys are Tank and Dozer.

	The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.

					MORPHEUS
			And this, this is the Core.  This
			is where we broadcast our pirate
			signal and hack into the Matrix.

	It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of
	coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic
	battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks
	of little systems and computer monitors.

	At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton
	chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.

	Near the circle of chairs is the control console and
	operator's station where the network is monitored.

					MORPHEUS
			Help him, Trinity.

	Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you remember when I asked you
			about an apparatus that could turn
			a virtual reality into reality?

	Neo nods.

					MORPHEUS
			It's right here.

	He touches Neo's head.

					MORPHEUS
			And it's accessed here.

	Neo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack
	at the back of his neck.  The cable has the same kind of
	cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.

					MORPHEUS
			This will feel a little weird.

	There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the
	needle in.

	We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens
	into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop
	like when you equalize them underwater.

	He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling
	of weightlessness inside another place --


	INT.  CONSTRUCT

	Neo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the Construct.

	Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the
	room with him.

					MORPHEUS
			It is our loading program.  We can
			load anything from clothes, to
			weapons, to training simulations.
			Anything we need.

	Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the
	two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a
	large-screen television.

					MORPHEUS
			Sit down.

	Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.

					NEO
			Right now, we're inside a computer
			program?

					MORPHEUS
			Wild, isn't it?

	Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.

					NEO
			This isn't real?

					MORPHEUS
			What is real?  How do you define
			real?  If you're talking about
			your senses, what you feel, taste,
			smell, or see, then all you're
			talking about are electrical
			signals interpreted by your brain.

	He picks up a remote control and clicks ON the
	TELEVISION.  We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the Chicago you know.
			Chicago as it was at the end of
			the twentieth century.  This
			Chicago exists only as part of a
			neural-interactive simulation that
			we call the Matrix.

	We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.

					MORPHEUS
			You have been living inside
			Baulliaurd's vision, inside the
			map, not the territory.  This is
			Chicago as it exists today.

	The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.  The
	earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out
	beneath us as we ENTER the television.

					MORPHEUS
			'The desert of the real.'

	In the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago
	protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of
	a long-dead corpse.

					MORPHEUS
			We are, right now, miles below the
			earth's surface.  The only place
			humans can survive outside the
			Matrix is underground.

	Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the
	chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert.
	Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.

					NEO
			What happened?

					MORPHEUS
			It started early in the twenty-
			first century, with the birth of
			artificial intelligence, a
			singular consciousness that
			spawned an entire race of
			machines.

	In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.

					MORPHEUS
			At first all they wanted was to be
			treated as equals, entitled to the
			same human inalienable rights.
			Whatever they were given, it was
			not enough.

	In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light
	up a bloody battle field.

					MORPHEUS
			We don't know who struck first.
			Us or them.  But sometime at the
			end of the twenty-first century
			the battle was joined.

	We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.

					MORPHEUS
			The war raged for generations and
			turned the face of our planet from
			green and blue to black and red.

	At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are
	at once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic
	architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is
	perpetually in motion.

	The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,
	splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.

					MORPHEUS
			It scorched and burned the sky.
			Without the sun, the machines
			sought out a new energy source to
			survive.

	The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink
	bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud
	of stain.

					MORPHEUS
			They discovered a new form of
			fusion.  All that was required to
			initiate the reaction was a small
			electric charge.  Throughout human
			history we have been dependent on
			machines to survive.  Fate, it
			seems, is not without a sense of
			irony.

	We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where
	we see human beings looking almost blissful in their
	gelatin cocoons.

					MORPHEUS
			The human body generates more bio-
			electricity than a 120-volt
			battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s
			of body heat.

	Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a
	breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.

					MORPHEUS
			We are, as an energy source,
			easily renewable and completely
			recyclable, the dead liquified and
			fed intravenously to the living.

	Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.

					MORPHEUS
			All they needed to control this
			new battery was something to
			occupy our mind.

	We see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous
	fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already
	growing around the brain-jack.

					MORPHEUS
			And so they built a prison out of
			our past, wired it to our brains
			and turned us into slaves.

	We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television
	and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.

					NEO
			No!  I don't believe it!  It's not
			possible!

					MORPHEUS
			I didn't say that it would be
			easy, Neo.  I just said that it
			would be the truth.

	The room without walls begins to spin.

					NEO
			Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,
	trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.

					NEO
			Get this thing out of me!

					TRINITY
			Easy, Neo.  Easy.

	Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out,
	he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the
	harness.

					NEO
			Don't touch me!  Get away from me!

	On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.
	Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
	as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.

					CYPHER
			He's going to pop!

	Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	He blinks, regaining consciousness.  The room is dark.
	Neo is stretched out on his bed.

					NEO
			I can't go back, can I?

	Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
	corner.

					MORPHEUS
			No.  But if you could, would you
			really want to?

	Neo isn't sure of that answer.

					MORPHEUS
			I feel that I owe you an apology.
			There is a rule that we do not
			free a mind once it reaches a
			certain age.  It is dangerous.
			They have trouble letting go..
			Their mind turns against them.
			I've seen it happen.  I broke the
			rule because I had to.

	He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to
	himself as Neo.

					MORPHEUS
			When the Matrix was first built
			there was a man born inside that
			had the ability to change what he
			wanted, to remake the Matrix as he
			saw fit.  It was this man that
			freed the first of us and taught
			us the secret of the war; control
			the Matrix and you control the
			future.

	He pauses.

					MORPHEUS
			When he died, the Oracle at the
			temple of Zion prophesied his
			return and envisioned an end to
			the war and freedom for our
			people.  That is why there are
			those of us that have spent our
			entire lives searching the Matrix,
			looking for him.

	Neo can feel his eyes on him.

					MORPHEUS
			I did what I did, because I
			believe we have been brought here
			for a reason, Neo.  You are here
			to serve a purpose, just as I am
			here to serve mine.

					NEO
			I told you I don't believe in
			fate.

	Morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.

					MORPHEUS
			But I do, Neo.  I do.

	He stands up.

					MORPHEUS
			Get some rest.  You're going to
			need it.

					NEO
			For what?

					MORPHEUS
			Your training.



	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	There is no morning; there is only darkness and then the
	fluorescent light sticks flicker on.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The
	door opens and TA.NK steps inside.

					TANK
			Morning.  Did you sleep?

					NEO
			No.

					TANK
			You will tonight.  I guarantee it.
			I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.

	He offers his hand and Neo shakes it.  He notices that
	Tank doesn't have any jacks.

					NEO
			You don't have...

					TANK
			Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my
			brother Dozer, we are 100 percent
			pure, old fashioned, home-grown
			human.  Born free.  Right here in
			the real world.  Genuine child of
			Zion.

					NEO
			Zion?

					TANK
			Zion is the place, man.  You'll
			see it one day.  Last human city.
			All we got left.

	Tank smiles.

					TANK
			Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm
			fairly excited to see what you are
			capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is
			right and all.  We're not supposed
			to talk.about any of that, but if
			you are, well then this is an
			exciting time.  We got a lot to do
			so let's get to it.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension
	chairs.

					TANK
			We're supposed to load all these
			operations programs first, but
			this is some major boring shit.
			Why don't we start something a
			little fun?

	Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  He
	begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro
	discs.

					TANK
			How about sore combat training?

	Neo reads the label on the disk.

					NEO
			Jiujitsu?  I'm going to learn
			jujitsu?

	Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.

					NEO
			No way.

	Smiling, Tank punches the "load" code.

	His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp
	shut.  The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds,
	adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.

	An instant later his eyes snap open.

					NEO
			Holy shit!

					TANK
			Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready
			for more?

					NEO
			Hell yes!


	INT.  MAIN DECK - CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR - LATER

	as grey pixels slowly fill a small, half-empty box.  It
	is a meter displaying how much download time is left.

	The title bar reads:  "Combat Series 10 of 12," file
	categories flashing beneath it:  Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,
	Drunken Boxing...

	Morpheus walks in.

					MORPHEUS
			How is he?

	Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.

					TANK
			Ten hours straight.  He's a
			machine.

	Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath
	hissing from his lips.  He looks like he just orgasmed.

	He locks at Morpheus.

					NEO
			This is incredible.  I know Kung
			Fu.

	Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin.  He nods to
	Tank.

					MORPHEUS
			Show me.


	INT.  DOJO

	They are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo.

					MORPHEUS
			This is a sparring program,
			similar to the programmed reality
			of the Matrix.  Consider this your
			first lesson.

	He assumes a fighting stance.

					MORPHEUS
			Attack me.

	Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until
	he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.

	It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and
	feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack
	--

	But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the
	two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive
	chairs.

	Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is
	wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and
	steady rhythm of Morpheus.


	INT.  MESS HALL

	Dinner is up.  Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell
	protein.  It has a cottage cheese consistency.

	MOUSE bursts in the room.

					MOUSE
			Morpheus is fighting Neo!

	All at once they bolt for the door.


	INT.  DOJO

	Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls
	himself at Morpheus.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation.
			But your weakness isn't your
			technique.

	Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.
	His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For
	every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --

	Neo falls.

	Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his
	mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.

					MORPHEUS
			How did I beat you?

					NEO
			You -- You're too fast.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you think my being faster,
			stronger has anything to do with
			my muscles in this place?

	Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you believe that's air you are
			breathing now?

	Neo squints at him.

					MORPHEUS
			If you can free your mind, the
			body will follow.

	Neo stands, nodding.

					MORPHEUS
			Again.

	Their fists fly with  pneumatic speed.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,
	like watching a game of Mortal Combat.

					CABLE
			Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast!

					MOUSE
			You ever seen anyone that fast
			that soon, Tank?

					TANK
			Never.

					APOC
			Morpheus is right.  He's got to be
			the one.


	INT.  DOJO

	The speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems
	impossible to sustain.  Neo's face sheds its mask of calm
	with a scream.

	He wants to beat Morpheus bad.

	Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the
	head, knocking his glasses off.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	There are several gasps.

					MOUSE
			I don't believe it!


	INT.  DOJO

	Morpheus rubs his face.

					MORPHEUS
			You are angry with me.

	Neo pants.

					NEO
			I, uh... maybe.

					MORPHEUS
			It's all right.  It's natural.

					NEO
			I feel better.

					MORPHEUS
			Good, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo,
			but it's a heavy one.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			Tank, load the jump program.

	Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain
	lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building
	rooftop in a city skyline.

					MORPHEUS
			You have to learn to let go of
			that anger.  You must let go of
			everything.

	A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.

					MORPHEUS
			You must empty yourself to free
			your mind.

	Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop.
	And jumps.  He sails through the air, his coat billowing
	out behind him like a cape --

	Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the
	street.

					NEO
			Shit.

	Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at
	Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.

					NEO
			Okie dokie.

	He takes a deep breath.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No
			problem.

	He concentrates.  Runs.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	They are transfixed.

					CABLE
			He's gonna make it.

					APOC
			No way.  Not possible.

					MOUSE
			No one's ever made their first
			jump.

					SWITCH
			What if he does?

					APOC
			He won't.

					TANK
			It's never been done.

	Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she
	whispers.

					TRINITY
			Come on.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP

	Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo
	launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek
	--

	But comes up drastically short.

	His eyes widen as he plummets.  Stories fly by, the
	ground rushing up at him, but as he hits --

	The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.

	He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on
	his back.

	He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from
	his face.

	Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.

					MORPHEUS
			Everyone falls the first time.

	Neo nods quietly.

					MORPHEUS
			If you never know failure, how can
			you know success?


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	They break up.

					MOUSE
			What does it mean?

					CABLE
			It doesn't mean anything.

					CYPHER
			Everyone falls, right, Trinity?

	But Trinity has left.

	Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to
	move and groans, cradling his ribs.

	While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.

					NEO
			I thought it wasn't real.

	Neo stares at the blood.

					NEO
			If you are killed in the Matrix,
			you die here?

					MORPHEUS
			The body cannot live without the
			mind.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.

					TRINITY
			Neo, I saved you some dinner --

	She sees him passed out on the bed.  She sets the tray
	down and pulls the blanket over him.

	She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,
	breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.

	It seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a
	start, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets
	out of bed.


	INT.  HALL

	The ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The core glows with monitor light.  Cypher is in the
	operator's chair as Neo cones up behind him.

					CYPHER
			Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the
			bejeezus out of ne.

					NEO
			Sorry.

					CYPHER
			No, it's all right.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					CYPHER
			Midnight watch.

	Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens
	that seem alive with a constant flow of data.

					NEO
			Is that... ?

					CYPHER
			The Matrix?  Yeah.

	The monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.

					CYPHER
			You want a drink?

	He pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.

					CYPHER
			I'll tell you, I feel for you,
			man.  I really do.  Most of us
			were still young, just punks, when
			Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you
			had a real life.

	Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds
	on his back.

					CYPHER
			Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it.
			It's good for two things:
			degreasing engines and killing
			brain cells.

	Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.

					CYPHER
			Did he tell you why he did it?

	Neo nods.

					CYPHER,
			I'll be the didn't tell you that
			this wasn't the first time he
			thought he found the One.

	Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.

					CYPHER
			Let me give you a piece of advice.
			Between you and me, if Morpheus
			says you can fly, I wouldn't go
			jumping out any windows to find
			out if he's right.  Understand?

	Cypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat-
	scorching mouthful.

					CYPHER
			Welcome to the real world!


	INT.  RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT

	CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as
	we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous
	steak.

					CYPHER
			That's what he said to me nine
			years ago.

	The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing
	red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.

					CYPHER
			The real world.  Ha, what a joke.

	We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.

					CYPHER
			You know what real is?  I'll tell
			you what real is.

	A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the
	face of Cypher.

					CYPHER
			Real is just another four-letter
			word.

	He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.

	The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago
	skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu
	has no prices.

	Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.

					AGENT SMITH
			Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

	Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his
	teeth.

					CYPHER
			Mmm, so, so fucking good.

	Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his
	mouth.

					CYPHER
			You know, I know that this steak
			doesn't exist.  I know when I put
			it in my mouth, the Matrix is
			telling my brain that it is juicy
			and delicious.  After nine years,
			do you know what I've realized?

	Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He
	pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef
	melting in his mouth.

					CYPHER
			Ignorance is bliss.

					AGENT SMITH
			Then we have a deal?

					CYPHER
			I don't want to remember nothing.
			Nothing!  You understand?  And I
			want to be rich.  Someone
			important.  Like an actor.  You
			can do that, right?

					AGENT SMITH
			Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

	Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.

					CYPHER
			All right.  You get my body back
			in a power plant, reinsert me into
			the Matrix and I'll get you what
			you want.

					AGENT SMITH
			Access codes to Zion.

					CYPHER
			I told you, I don't know them.
			But I can give you the man who
			does.

					AGENT SMITH
			Morpheus.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Sweat dapples his lip as Neo snaps out of the construct
	coma.

					NEO
			Jeez, I was wondering about that.

					TANK
			What?

					NEO
			Why I was bald here but not in the
			Matrix.

					TANK
			R.S.I.

					NEO
			Residual self image.

					TANK
			Good.  Now what's this?

	He points to one of Neo's monitors.

					NEO
			Life systems monitor, glucose
			levels.

					TANK
			What's that?

					NEO
			Main power supply to the core.

	He follows Tank to the operator's station where he points
	to a red key-switch.

					TANK
			How about this?

					NEO
			Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all
			remaining power to generate an...
			E.M.P?

					TANK
			Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best
			weapon against the machines.  The
			problem is if someone is still in
			the Matrix when that thing goes
			off, they're not coming back.

	Neo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.

					MORPHEUS
			How's he doing?

					TANK
			We just finished the operation
			programs and he's showing great
			retention.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.  I want everyone alerted to
			12-hour stand-by.  We're going in.
			Neo, it's time for you to know why
			you're here.

	Morpheus walks away.

					NEO
			What's he talking about?

					TANK
			He's taking you into the Matrix to
			see her.

					NEO
			See who?

					TANK
			The Oracle.

	Neo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data
	that seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as
	a METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING --


	EXT.  CHICAGO (MATRIX) - DAY

	An El train.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The room is empty, heavy curtains covering windows.  It
	looks as if it hasn't been touched in years.  In the
	bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE
	begins to RING.

	In the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep
	TURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team.

	Morpheus answers the phone.

					MORPHEUS
			We're in.

	He hangs up.

					MORPHEUS
			Mouse and Cable hold the exit.
			Let's go.


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo follows the others down the stairwell that winds
	around an antique elevator shaft.

					NEO
			Did you have to do this?

					TRINITY
			Yeah.

					NEO
			What did she tell you?

					TRINITY
			Lots of things.

					NEO
			Any of them true?

	Trinity looks at him, then looks away.

					TRINITY
			Some of them.

					GIZMO
			Were they good or bad?

					TRINITY
			There's no point in worrylng.
			Whatever is going to happen is
			going to happen.

	They cross the old lobby.  Switch and Apoc stop at the
	doors.

					MORPHEUS
			We should be back in an hour.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright.
	He is the only one without sunglasses.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you now understand what it
			means when we say, if you're not
			one of us, you're one of them?

					NEO
			The agents.  They're sentient
			programs.  They can commandeer any
			software hardwired to the
			mainframe.

					MORPHEUS
			Anyone that is still in a power
			plant.  That is why we try to be
			invisible in the Matrix.

					NEO
			The best hacking is always
			traceless.

	Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the
	perimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he
	surreptitiously drops something inside.

	It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as
	the LINE CONNECTS.

	An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a
	corrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in.


	INT.  LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY

	An enormous man is waiting for them.  A wad of chewing
	tobacco bulges his cheek.  He spits into a Coke can.

					MOJO
			Morpheus, been a long time coming.

					MORPHEUS
			You're looking well, Mojo.

	Mojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his
	chin and shirt.  He stares at Neo.

					MOJO
			You bringing us geriatrics now.
			Morpheus?

	He spits and laughs again.

					MOJO
			Guess you are locking for a
			miracle.


	EXT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of
	neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes.


	INT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	A lightless, lower-class bar.  No one enters that is not
	expected.

	The front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as
	Mojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside.  Neo looks around,
	his eyes adjusting to the darkness.

	Mojo talks to the bartender, then looks over.

					MOJO
			All right, it's cool.  Go on back.

	They weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY
	FLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET.

	A monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up.

					REX
			You're late.

	He moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind
	him.  They descend the basement staircase toward the
	single bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only
	door.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	A high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of
	milk crates.  Neo waits as Morpheus types in a series of
	access codes.  After a moment the screen blinks, "Welcome
	Morpheus."

	Morpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it
	now leads into --


	INT.  TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY

	The walls and floors are polished marble.  Neo follows,
	his mouth agape.

					NEO
			What -- what happened?

					MORPHEUS
			This is the temple.  It is a part
			of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden
			inside the Matrix so that we can
			access it.

	Two PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.

					PRIESTESS
			Hello, Morpheus.  We've been
			expecting you.

					MORPHEUS
			Okay, you're on your own.  Go with
			them.

	They take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into
	another room.

					PRIESTESS
			Wait here.  Among the other
			Potentials.


	INT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
	his age.  The Potentials are all little children.

	The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
	kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
	shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
	others meditating or practicing their gift.

	Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
	blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
	blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.

	Neo crosses to him, sits.

	The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
	imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
	it bend.

					SPOON BOY
			Your spoon does not bend because
			it is just that, a spoon.  Mine 
			bends because there is no spoon,
			just my mind.

	Neo watches as it curls into a knot.

					SPOON BOY
			Link yourself to the spoon.
			Become the spoon and bend
			yourself.

	Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.

					NEO
			There is no spoon.  Right.

	He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
	Priestess touches his shoulder.

					PRIESTESS
			The Oracle will see you now.

	Spoon Boy smiles.


	INT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters nervously.  Beneath his feet is a path of the
	zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
	a three-legged throne.

	The throne is empty.

					NEO
			Hello?

	A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
	the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
	cooking.

	Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
	finds an open door.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Just come on in.

	He walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous
	moonstone headdress and velvet robes.  A second door
	leads into --


	INT.  ORACLE'S CHAMBERS (MATRIX) - DAY

	It looks like a suburban tract house.

	There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch
	filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with
	doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.

	Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.

	A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside
	through the cracked door.

					NEO
			Hello?

					ORACLE (WOMAN)
			I know.  You're Neo.  Be right
			with you.

					NEO
			You're the Oracle?

					ORACLE
			Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing
			you non-believers.  It's really a
			relief.  All that pomp and
			circumstances just plain tucker me
			out.  Almost done.  Smell good,
			don't they?

					NEO
			Yeah.

					ORACLE
			I'd ask you to sit down, but
			you're not going to anyway.  And
			don't worry about the vase.

					NEO
			What vase?

	He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from
	the table.  It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.

					ORACLE
			The vase.

					NEO
			Shit, I'm sorry.

	She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.
	She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,
	comfortable slacks and a print blouse.  She looks like
	someone's grandma.

					ORACLE
			I said don't worry about it.  I'll
			get one of my kids to fix it.

					NEO
			How did you know...?

	She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.

					ORACLE
			What's really going to bake your
			noodle later on is, would you
			still have broken it if I hadn't
			said anything.

	Smiling, she lights a cigarette.

					ORACLE
			You're cuter than I thought.  I
			see why she likes you.

					NEO
			Who?

					ORACLE
			Not too bright, though.

	She winks.

					ORACLE
			You know why Morpheus brought you
			to see me?

					NEO
			I think so.

					ORACLE
			So? What do you think?  You think
			you're the one?

					NEO
			I don't know.

	She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma
	has, except that the words are in Latin.

					ORACLE
			You know what that means?  It's
			Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'

	She puts her cigarette down.

					ORACLE
			Well, let's have a look at you.

	She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the
	glands in his neck.

					ORACLE
			Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'

	She nods then looks at his palms.

					ORACLE
			Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but
			it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news
			is, you're not the one.  Still got
			a lot to learn.  Maybe next life.

					NEO
			What's the good news?

					ORACLE
			Same as the bad news, you're not
			the one.

					NEO
			Is that it, then?

					ORACLE
			No.  Here.

	She picks up the tray of cooling cookies.

					ORACLE
			You better take a cookie.  Got a
			big day ahead of you.

	He eyes her, then takes a cookie.

					ORACLE
			Make a believer out of you yet.


	INT.  ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo
	out.  When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on
	Neo's shoulder.

					MORPHEUS
			You don't have to tell me
			anything, Neo, because I already
			know what she said.

					NEO
			You do?

					MORPHEUS
			I brought you so that you could
			hear it for yourself.  I knew it
			would help.

	Neo finishes his cookie.

					MORPHEUS
			No one will ever ask you because
			it is a gift from her.  It is for
			you and you alone.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns
	jaundice.

	Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets.
	He notices several unmarked white vans.

	He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees
	the black Lincoln.

					TRINITY
			Here they come.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	In the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's
	face and neck.

	Tank is typing rapidly at the keyboard.

					TANK
			Weird.  This area never has this
			much activity.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Apoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Mouse's CELLULAR RINGS.

					MOUSE
			Welcome to Movie-Phone.

					TANK (V.O.)
			They're on their way.

					MOUSE
			Right.

	The phone flips shut as he jumps up.

					MOUSE
			Let's get to work.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Light filters down the throat of the building through a
	caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft.
	Four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around
	the antique elevator.

	Neo notices a black cat, a yellow-green-eyed shadow that
	slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs.

	A moment later, Neo sees another black cat that looks and
	moves identically to the first one.

					NEO
			Whoa.  Deja vu.

	Those words stop the others dead in their tracks.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an
	electronic seizure.

					TANK
			Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity turns around, her face tight.

					TRINITY
			What did you just say?

					NEO
			Nothing.  Just had a little deja
			vu.

					TRINITY
			What happened?  What did you see?

					NEO
			A black cat went past us and then
			I saw another that looked just
			like it.

					TRINITY
			How much like it?  Was it the same
			cat?

					NEO
			It might have been.  I'm not sure.

	Trinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the
	rasping breath of the old building.

					NEO
			What is it?

					TRINITY
			A deja vu is usually a glitch in
			the Matrix.  It happens when they
			change something.

	She also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER
	BLADES GROW ominously LOUDER.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank sees what was changed.

					TANK
			It's a trap!


	INT.  STAIRCASE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus looks up the stairs as a helicopter shadow
	passes over the clouded glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Come on!


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cable goes to the draped windows.

					CABLE
			Did you just feel something weird?

					MOUSE
			Yeah...

	The CELLULAR RINGS.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Heavy bolt-cutters snap through the main phone cable.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Mouse answers the phone.

					MOUSE
			What's going on?

					TANK (V.O.)
			They cut the hard-line!  It's a
			trap!  Get out!

	Cable yanks open the curtain.

					CABLE
			Oh, no.

	The windows are bricked up.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The door to the roof explodes open as heavily-armed rnen
	rush towards room 1313.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank watches helplessly.

					TANK
			No, no, no.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The door slams open and the police force pours in, dozens
	of assault rifles surrounding Mouse and Cable who are
	armed with only handguns.

					CABLE
			Morpheus!  It's a trap --


	INT.  STAIRS (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus stops as the scream is drowned by the REPORT of
	MACHINE GUNS filling the building with a terrible fury.

					TRINITY
			Oh, God.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as --


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick
	window.  Gun smoke thickens the room, Cable blasting and
	moving until --

	The HAMMER CLICKS empty.  He screams as a DOZEN GUNS OPEN
	FIRE, ripping him apart.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Blood spits from Cable's mouth, his body spasming, then
	lying perfectly still.

	The flat-line ALARM softly cries out from the life
	MONITORS of the two dead men.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	More police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby
	doors.


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Flying downstairs, Morpheus stops, hearing the police
	swarming below.  He turns and rushes down the hall of the
	eighth floor.  At the end of it, he finds the bricked-up
	windows.

					CYPHER
			That's what they changed.  We're
			trapped.  There's no way out.

	The sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the
	mechanical sureness of a vice.

					MORPHEUS
			Give me your phone.

					TRINITY
			They'll be able to track it.

					MORPHEUS
			We have no choice.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank answers the call.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Tank, find a structural drawing of
			this building and find it fast.

	His fingers pound the keyboard.


	INT.  LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Flashlights probe the rotting darkness as the police
	search every floor.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The diagram windows onto the screen.

					TANK
			Got it.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I need the main wet-wall.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith pauses, his hand going to his earpiece.


	INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus is guided by Tank.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Now left and that's it in front of
			you.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.

	He cuts off the phone.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith hears the LINE CLICK dead.

					AGENT SMITH
			Eighth floor.  They're on the

	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Brown hears Smith on his earphone.

					AGENT BROWTJ
			Eighth floor!  Move!


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cops flood the eighth floor, rushing everywhere.


	INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Several cops sweep through the room.  It is empty.  As
	they pass the bathroom, we see a man-sized hole smashed
	through the plaster and lathe.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They are inside the main plumbing wall, slowly worming
	their way down the greasy, black stack pipes.

	Above them, light fills the hole they made to get inside.

	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Brown turns to Smith.

					AGENT BROWN
			Where are they?


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The cops search in silence, straining for a clue, when
	one hears SOMETHING STRANGE near the bathroom.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and
	several thick supply pipes.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Cop leans in, his ear almost against the thin
	membrane of plaster separating them.  He can hear
	WHISPERS, HISSES and a GRUNT when --

	The WALL suddenly bulges, SHATTER-CRACKING as the Cop
	realizes --

					COP
			They're in the walls!


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo pulls Cypher free just as the Cop OPENS FIRE --

	BULLETS PUNCHING shafts of light like swords into the box
	of soot-black space.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Cop keeps FIRING, his flashlight strapped to his gun
	barrel, lighting up the wall until --

	A BULLET spits out his forehead.  Agent Smith watches the
	BODY fall with a THUD.

					AGENT SMITH
			Are orders that hard to follow?
			I'll say it again.  Morpheus must
			be taken alive.  Understand?


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They're almost falling, they're climbing so fast.

	Above them, plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits
	shower down on them, filling the crawlway with dust.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith looks into the open wall, at the exposed
	intestines of the building, and realizes where they are
	going.

					AGENT SMITH
			How like a rodent.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Just below, a RIFLE-BUTT SMASHES open the WALL, light
	raking across the lathe.

					COP
			I got him!  I got him!

	Trinity finds her gun first.  BULLET-HOLES POP out the
	WALL as she STRAFES the room, sending cops diving for
	cover.

	They continue, Trinity exposed for a roment, when a
	creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful
	of her hair.

	He starts to yank her out when Neo kicks, his boot
	bursting through plaster and splintering lathe, knocking
	the Cop out.

	They then quickly sink out of sight.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	This part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was
	the main mechanical room.  There are four enormous
	boilers, dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot
	water like arteries.

	Black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into
	the tangled web of pipes.

	Their enemies are waiting for them.

	Blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked
	figures FIRE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

	Smoke blossoms from the green-metal canisters.

	Morpheus never stops moving.  Searching the floor, he
	finds what.he needs; the cover of the catch basin.

	Cypher watches him pry open the grate, when a gas can
	bounces near him.

					MORPHEUS
			Come on!

	Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Cypher's body begins to shiver uncontrollably.

					TANK
			Nerve gas.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus watches Cypher disappear into the smoke then
	follows the others down the wet-black hole.


	INT.  CATCH BASIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	They crawl through greasy black water in a three foot
	diameter pipe that feeds into the sewer main.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Gas-masked apparitions find the open hole.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still
	shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.  As he is led past
	Agent Smith, it almost seems that both men smile.

					AGENT SMITH
			We have them now.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo punches out the screen and then spills down into the
	main water trough.

	Oily water forms around them as they wade across the man-
	made underground river, towards the service catwalk.

	Neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming.

	Flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in
	helmets and heavy armor, looking more nachine than human,
	fill both ends of the tunnel.

	There is a single manhole cover above them.

	Morpheus whispers to Trinity.

					MORPHEUS
			You have to get Neo out.
			Understand?  That's all that
			matters now.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus, don't --

					MORPHEUS
			He must get out.  Do you
			understand me?

	She nods.

	A font of water erupts as Morpheus leaps for the manhole
	ladder, his coat flying open like the wings of a manta
	ray.

					COPS
			There he is!  That's him!

	Pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the
	surface.

					COP
			He's heading for the street!

	Trinity urges the others to follow her.  Grabbing Neo,
	they wade quietly away from the chaos.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are
	waiting for him.  The closest cop is armed with a
	tranquilized gun.  He fires --

	But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a
	shield, blocking the darts, then --

	Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him
	off his feet.

	The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a
	deadly weapon moving with impossible speed.

	It seems he might fight his way out when he throws a
	spinning back fist that is caught by --

	Agent Smith.

					AGENT SMITH
			So, we meet at last.

					MORPHEUS
			And you are?

					AGENT SMITH
			Smith.  I am Agent Smith.

					MORPHEUS
			You all look the same to me.

					AGENT SMITH
			I've been waiting for this noment.

	Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a
	jaw-breaking right.

				MORPHEUS
			Oh, so have I.

	Agent Smith smiles.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity leads the others, fading into the darkness of the
	tunnel, lit only with shafts of lights streaming through
	the street drains as we RISE TOWARDS them --

	THROUGH a grate INTO the fight.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Smith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows
	that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding
	police.

	Agent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers
	Morpheus.

					AGENT SMITH
			You can't win.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			I already have.

	He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his
	eyes.

					AGENT SMITH
			Take him.

	Cops swarm over Morpheus.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for
	Morpheus.

					TANK
			No!


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged
	transport vehicle.  The DOOR CLANGS shut.

	Agent Jones finds Agent Smith.

					AGENT JONES
			The others were lost.

					AGENT SMITH
			You've taken care of Reagan?

	Agent Jones nods.

					AGENT SMITH
			Then the others do not matter.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	A manhole cover cracks open.  Two eyes peek out just as a
	TRUCK RATTLES over it.  The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the
	cover opens.

	Neo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out.  Trinity pulls a
	water-logged phone from her pocket.

					TRINITY
			We need a phone.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix.

			We gotta find the others.  They're

			Operator.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			I need an exit!  Fast!

					TANK
			Cypher?  I thought they had you?


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher is standing at a public phone.  Across the street
	is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided
	witli an oncoming car.

					CYPHER
			There was an accident.  A fucking
			car accident.  All of a sudden.
			Boom.  They're all dead.  I still
			got the shakes but, Jesus,
			someone's going to make a believer
			out of me.

	They are outside a pawn shop.  Trinity has a new cellular.

					TRINITY
			We need an exit!

					TANK (V.O.)
			Gotcha.  You're not far from
			Cypher.

					TRINITY
			Cypher, I thought --

					TANK (V.O.)
			So did we.  That boy's got nine
			lives.  I sent him to Franklin and
			Erie.

					TRINITY
			Got it.

	She hangs up.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Running, Cypher turns onto Erie.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on
	metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.

	Plywood covering a small window is ripped off and Cypher
	crawls inside.

	Deep in the back room, a PHONE that has not rung in years
	begins to RING.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank punches the emit command.

					TANK
			Got him.

	Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself
	awake.  His eyes blink open.  Dozer unplugs him.

					DOZER
			System check looks fine.

	Cypher stands, a raspy cough spewing from his lungs.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity sees the appliance shop.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Cypher holds his chest.

					DOZER
			You okay?

					CYPHER
			Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing
			me.

	He crosses to an overhead bin.

					CYPHER
			We got any pain killers?

					DOZER
			The first aid kit's over here.

	As Dozer stoops for a cabinet, Cypher pulls back a heavy
	blanket exposing a plasma rifle.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo crawls through the window that Cypher opened.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank finishes loading the exit programs as Cypher rises
	behind him, swinging the weapon at his back.

	He looks over as Dozer turns with the first aid kit, a
	look of frozen disbelief crossing his face --

					DOZER
			No!

	Tank spins as red hot wads of PLASMA EXPLODE through his
	chair and into his back.  Diving, a second BURST tears up
	his side --

	As Dozer shoots a look at the monitor where Tank was
	working.  He stabs the enter command activating the exit
	sequence and ducks under a BARRAGE of PLASMA FIRE-


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The PHONE begins to RING as the others crawl in.

			God, I love that sound.

	Dozer rolls up, grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of
	tools.

	Cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the

	Dozer charges, screaming, and the PLASMA RIFLE SCREAMS
	back.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The PHONE is still RINGING.

					TRINITY
			You first,.Neo.

	Neo answers the phone when there is a CLICK.  There is no
	signal.  Nothing but silence.

					TRINITY
			What happened?

					NEO
			I don't know.  It just went dead.

	Trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the
	cellular.


	INT. MAIN DECK

	The operator PHONE begins to RING- Cypher steps over the
	body of Tank and looks at the monitor.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity can almost feel him watching them.  Every
	unanswered RING wrings her gut a little tighter, until --

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Hello, Trinity.

					TRINITY
			Cypher?  Where's Tank?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			He had an accident.

					TRINITY
			An accident?  What about Dozer?
			Is Dozer there?


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	He walks over to Trinity's body, staring down at it
	hanging in its coma-like stillness.

					CYPHER
			You know, for a long time, I
			thought I was in love with you,
			Trinity.  I used to dream about
			you...

	He nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of
	it.

					CYPHER
			You are a beautiful woman.  Too
			bad things had to work out like
			this.

	We INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main
	deck.

					TRINITY
			You killed them.

					APOC
			What?!

					SWITCH
			Oh God.

	Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the
	silent bodies.

					CYPHER
			In a way you're very lucky.  Most
			people never know why they die.
			One minute they're alive, the next
			they're dead.  No warning.
			Nothing.  That's why I thought
			maybe I should tell you.  It
			seemed the least I could do.

	He stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils
	up out of him.

					CYPHER
			You see, the truth, the real,truth
			is that the war is over.  It's
			been over for a long time.  And
			guess what?  We lost!  Did you
			hear that?  We lost the war!

					TRINITY
			What about Zion?

					CYPHER
			Zion?  Zion is a part of this
			delusion.  More of this madness.
			That's why this has to be done.
			It has to end.  Now and forever.

	She suddenly sees the entire dark plan.

					TRINITY
			Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion.
			You gave them Morpheus for the
			access codes to Zion.

	Cypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to
	Apoc's body.

					CYPHER
			You see, Trinity, we humans have a
			place in the future.  But it's not
			here.  It's in the Matrix.

					TRINITY
			The Matrix isn't real!

					CYPHER
			Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I
			disagree.  I think the Matrix is
			more real than this world.  I
			mean, all I do is pull a plug
			here.  But there, you watch a man
			die.

	He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and
	yanks it out.

					CYPHER
			You tell me which is more real.

	Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in
	his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then
	falls dead.  Switch screams.

					CYPHER
			Welcome to the real world, right?

	He laughs.

					TRINITY
			Somehow, some way, you're going to
			pay for this.

					CYPHER
			Pay for it?  I'm not even going to
			remember it.  It'll be like it
			never happened.  The tree falling
			in the forest.  It doesn't make a
			sound.

	His hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes
	hold of her plug.

	She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she
	is murdered.

					TRINITY
			Goddamn you, Cypher!

					CYPHER
			Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just
			the messenger.  And right now I'm
			going to prove that the message is
			true.

	He stands over Neo.

					CYPHER
			If Morpheus was right, then
			there's no way I can pull this
			plug, is there?

	She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is
	next.

					CYPHER
			If he is the One, then in the next
			few seconds there has to be some
			kind of miracle to stop me.
			Because if he dies like the others
			that means Morpheus was wrong.
			How can he be the One if he's
			dead?

	He takes hold of the cord when --

	She hears an EXPLOSION and a scream.

	Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the
	knee.  He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and
	the sights of the plasma rifle.

					TANK
			How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing
			you're about to die?

					NEO
			It's Tank!  He's alive.

	Cypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head
	off.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	They're both listening, trying to figure out what is
	happening when the store PHONE starts to RING.

	Trinity smiles, tears moistening her eyes as Neo throws
	his arms around her.  For a moment, it looks as if they
	might kiss before Trinity lets go.

					TRINITY
			We should, we should hurry.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Right.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Trinity's eyes open, a sense of relief surging through
	her at the sight of the ship.  As Tank unplugs her, she
	sees his charred wounds.

					TRINITY
			Tank, you're hurt.

					TANK
			I'll be all right.

					TRINITY
			Dozer?

	Tank's face tightens.

					TRINITY
			I'm sorry, Tank.


	EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	A Japanese luxury hotel in downtown Chicago.

	A military helicopter sets down on the roof.  Heavily
	armed Marines begin to deploy.

	Agent Jones gets out of the helicopter, flanked by
	columns of Marines.  They open the roof access door
	and enter the top-floor maintenance level of the hotel.


	INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

	They get in the elevator.  At every door, at least two
	Marines stop and post guard.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They exit the elevator and walk to the Presidential
	suite; the final two Marines post guard.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Inside, he finds Agent Smith.

					AGENT JONES
			There is a problem.  Reagan has
			failed to secure the hardware.

	Agent Smith stares out the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			Never send a human to do a
			machine's job.

					AGENT JONES
			But if Reagan has failed, why
			haven't they pulled the plug?

					AGENT SMITH
			Haven't you learned by now, that
			it is impossible to understand why
			they do the things they do?

	He turns.

					AGENT SMITH
			Continue as planned.  Trace his
			signal to locate their position
			and deploy an extermination unit.

	Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist.
	He is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of
	serum, alternately shivering and sweating.  He is hooked
	up to various monitors with white disk electrodes.

	Agent Brown begins running a trace program.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo looks at Morpheus whose body is covered with a cold
	sweat.

					NEO
			What are they doing to him?

					TANK
			They're cracking his mind.

					NEO
			How?

					TANK
			They inject virus-like serums to
			break down the system.  It's like
			cracking a computer.  All it takes
			is time.

					NEO
			How much time?

					TANK
			Depends on the mind.  But
			eventually, it will crack and his
			alpha pattern will change from
			this to this.

	Tank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit.
	The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an
	orderly symmetrical one.

					TANK
			When it does, Morpheus will tell
			them anything they want to know.

					NEO
			The access codes to Zion.

					TANK
			If an agent got inside Zion's
			mainframe he could do anything.
			Disable the defense system. It
			would be the end of us.

	He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.

					TANK
			We can't let that happen.  We have
			to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be
			protected.

	Trinity sees Cypher's dead body.  Rage overtakes her and
	she starts kicking hin.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!

					TANK
			We have to pull the plug.

					TRINITY
			No!

					TANK
			We don't have any other choice.

	Those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and
	we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze.  She
	walks past him and gets into her chair.

					TANK
			Trinity, what are you doing?

					TRINITY
			I'm going in after him.

					TANK
			Morpheus could conform at any
			minute --

					TRINITY
			If he does I'm sure you'll do what
			has to be done.

					TANK
			You saw that place.  It's suicide.

	She glares at him.

					TANK
			I know what Morpheus means to
			you --

					TRINITY
			No.  No, I don't think you do.  If
			you did, then you would know that
			I'm not letting him go.  Not
			without a fight, Tank.

	She yanks her harness tight.

					TRINITY
			Not without a fight.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite,
	staring out the windows at the city, below, shimmering
	with brilliant sunlight.

					AGENT SMITH
			Have you ever stood and stared at
			it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its
			beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of
			people just living out their 
			lives... oblivious.

	Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a
	hypodermic needle.

					AGENT SMITH
			Did you know that the first Matrix
			was designed to be a perfect human
			world?  Where none suffered, where
			everyone would be happy.  It was a
			disaster.  No one would accept the
			program.  Entire crops were lost.

	Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and
	plunges down.

					AGENT SMITH
			Some believed we lacked the
			programming language to describe
			your perfect world.  But I believe
			that, as a species, human beings
			define their reality through
			suffering and misery.

	Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react
	violently to the injection.

					AGENT SMITH
			The perfect world was a dream that
			your primitive cerebrum kept
			trying to wake up from.  Which is
			why the Matrix was re-designed to
			this:  the peak of your
			civilization.

	He turns from the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			I say 'your civilization' because
			as soon as we start thinking for
			you, it really becomes our
			civilization, which is, of course,
			what this is all about.

	He sits down directly in front of Morpheus.

					AGENT SMITH
			Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution.

	He lifts Morpheus' head.

					AGENT SMITH
			Like the dinosaur.  Look out that
			window.  You had your time.

	Morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the
	pain racking his mind.

					AGENT SMITH
			The future is our world, Morpheus.
			The future is our time.

			What do you think you're doing?

					NEO
			You need help.  I'm coming with
			you.

					TRINITY
			No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed
			himself so you could escape.
			There's no way you're going back
			in.

					NEO
			Morpheus did what he did because
			he believed that I'm something
			that I'm not.

					TRINITY
			What?

					NEO
			I'm not the One, Trinity.  The
			Oracle told me.

	Trinity is stunned.

					NEO
			She said I had a gift but I still
			had a lot to learn.  She told me
			maybe next life.

					TRINITY
			Did you tell Morpheus?

					NEO
			Why?  It wouldn't mean anything.
			He'd still believe what he wanted
			to believe.  But Morpheus is the
			one that matters.  He's more
			important than me and we both know
			it.

	He straps in.

					NEO
			I may not be what Morpheus thinks
			I am, but if I don't try to help
			him, then I'm not even what I
			think I am.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is

			I'd like to share a revelation

			It came to me when I tried to

	The life signs continue their chaotic patterns.

					AGENT SMITH
			Every mammal on this planet
			instinctively develops a natural
			equilibrium with the surrounding
			environment.  But you humans do
			not.  You move to an area and you
			multiply and multiply until every
			natural resource is consumed and
			the only way you can survive is to
			spread to another area.

	He leans forward.

					AGENT SMITH
			There is another organism on this
			planet that follows the same
			pattern.  Do you know what it is?
			A virus.

	He smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			Human beings are a disease, a
			cancer of this planet.  You are a
			plague.  And we are... the cure.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Trinity and Neo hang motionless in the suspension unit.
	Tank is at the operations station.

					TANK
			Okay.  Store's open.  What do you
			need?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Guns.  Lots of guns.

					TANK
			Coming right up.

	He loads the weapons disk.


	INT.  CONSTRUCT

	Racks of weapons appear and Neo and Trinity arm
	themselves.

					TRINITY
			No one has ever done anything like

					NEO
			Yeah?

	He snap cocks an Uzi.

					NEO
			That's why it's going to work.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith is again at the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			Why isn't the serum working?

					AGENT BROWN
			Perhaps we are asking the wrong
			questions.

					AGENT JONES
			Or he doesn't know.

					AGENT SMITH
			Of course he knows.  He's
			resisting.

					AGENT BROWN
			How?

					AGENT SMITH
			I don't know.  If I knew...

	Agent Smith hides his knotting fist.  He is becoming
	angry.  It is something that isn't supposed to happen to
	agents.

					AGENT SMITH
			Leave me with him.

	Agent Brown and Jones look at each other.

					AGENT SMITH
			Now!

	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank sits down beside Morpheus whose face is ashen like
	someone near death.  He takes hold of his hand.

			Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming

	EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	A dark wind blows.


	INT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	In long, black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the
	revolving doors.

	Neo is carrying a duffel bag.  Trinity has a large metal
	suitcase.  They cut across the lobby drawing nervous
	glances.

	Dark glasses, game faces.

	Several plainclothes cops try to stop them.  They are met
	by the MUTED SPIT of a SILENCED GUN and the RAZORED
	WHISTLE of THROWING STARS.

	The cops slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and
	Trinity do not even break stride.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith leans close to Morpheus, whispering to him.

					AGENT SMITH
			Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm
			going to be honest with you.

	He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his
	shoulder.

					AGENT SMITH
			I hate this place.  This zoo.
			This prison.  This reality,
			whatever you want to call it, I
			can't stand it any longer.  It's
			the smell, if there is such a
			thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I
			can taste your stink and every
			time I do, I fear that I've
			somehow been infected by it.

	He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips
	of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.

					AGENT SMITH
			Repulsive, isn't it?

	He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both
	hands.

					AGENT SMITH
			I must get out of here, I must get
			free.  In this mind is tlie key.
			My key.

	Morpheus sneers through his pain.

					AGENT SMITH
			Once Zion is gone, there's no
			need for me to be here.  Do you
			understand?  I need the codes.  I
			have to get inside Zion.  You have
			to tell me how.

	He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.

					AGENT SMITH
			Tell me!  Tell me!

	The skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown
	burst into the room.  Agent Smith releases Morpheus.

					AGENT BROWN
			What were you doing?

	Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.

					AGENT JONES
			You don't know.

					AGENT SMITH
			Know what?

	Agent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what
	he is hearing.


	INT.  ELEVATORS (MATRIX) - DAY

	They get in.  Trinity immediately drops and opens the
	suitcase, wiring a plastique and napalm bomb.

	Beneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung
	from climbing harnesses.

	Neo hits the emergency stop.  He pulls down part of the
	false ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Jones looks at Morpheus.

					AGENT JONES
			I think they're trying to save
			him.


	INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable.  Both
	of them lock on.  He looks up the long, dark throat of
	the building and takes a deep breath.

					NEO
			There is no spoon.

	Neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower
	than where they attached themselves.

	BOOM!  The CABLE SNAPS.

	The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up
	through the shaft as --

	The elevator falls away beneath them, distending space,
	filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar
	to the top.


	INT.  LOBBY (MATRIX) - DAY

	The ELEVATOR hits the botton.

	BA-BOOM!

	The massive EXPLOSION blows open the doors, fire clouds
	engulfing the elevator section of the lobby.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Agents hear the BLAST AND FIRE ALARMS.

					AGENT JONES
			Lower level --

					AGENT BROWN
			They are actually attacking.


	INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Hanging by a rope, Trinity hot-wires the panel for the
	door.


	INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly
	and slides open.

	Black smoke rises out of the exposed shaft.

	The nearest Marine eases to the edge, peering down at the
	churning blaze engulfing the lower levels.

	He does not see Trinity and Neo above him until it is too
	late.

	Krack!  Neo kicks, knocking the Marine flying down into
	the shaft.

	Before the others can react, Trinity flips out into the
	hall, decking the nearest Marine.  Neo cracks another.

	The fight is over before it begins.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the
	building.  The ALARM SOUNDS, emergency sprinklers begin
	showering the room.

	Agent Smith smashes a table.

					AGENT SMITH
			Find them and destroy them!

	Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.


	EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

	The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo
	and Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines.

	Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used
	with the same deadly precision as their feet and their
	fists.

	Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter
	watches the ferocious onslaught.

					PILOT
			I repeat, we are under attack!

	Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by
	spreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as --

	Agent Jones emerges.

	Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's
	coming.

	Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is
	behind him.

	Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with
	thought-speed.

	Fingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we
	look through the sights and gun smoke at --

	The Agent blurred with motion --

	Until the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal.

					NEO
			Trinity!

	Agent Jones charges.

					NEO
			... help.

	His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --

	Bullet-time.

	The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo
	twists, bends, ducks just between them.

	Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS
	coming faster until --

	Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a
	spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.

	He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
	his thigh.

	He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent
	Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final
	time.

	CLICK.  Empty.

	Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house
	kick snaps his jaw.  Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels
	it at Neo.

					AGENT JONES
			Only human...

	Suddenly Agent Jones stops.  Something is wrong.  He
	scans the roof.  Trinity is gone.

	Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the
	muzzle of her .45 --

	Jammed right into his head.

					TRINITY
			Dodge this, motherfucker!

	BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The body flies back with a flash of
	mercurial light and when it hits the ground --

	It is the pilot.

	Trinity helps Neo up.

					NEO
			Thanks.

					TRINITY
			You're hit --

					NEO
			I'm fine.

	Neo is already looking at the helicopter.

					NEO
			Can you fly that thing?

					TRINITY
			Not yet.

	She pulls out a cellular phone.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is back at the controls.

					TANK
			Operator.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Tank, I need a pilot program for a
			military M-109 helicopter.

	Tank is immediately searching the disk drawers.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Hurry!

	His fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding
	one that he feeds into Trinityls supplement drive,
	punching the "load" cormands on her keyboard.


	EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity's eyes flutter as information surges into her
	brain, all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed
	at light-speed.

					TRINITY
			Let's go.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof,
	are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the
	corner.

					SERGEANT
			Sir!  Sir!  There was gunfire --
			we've lost communication with the
			roof!

					AGENT JONES
			Remain at your posts.

					SERGEANT
			But, sir -- the fire -- we should
			evacuate!

					AGENT JONES
			You will do as you are ordered!

					SERGEANT
			Yes, sir.

	Agent Jones marches into the Presidential Suite.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Jones throws open the bedroom door and enters,
	walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet.

	Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears
	a SOUND and understands the seriousness of the attack.

	He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops
	INTO VIEW --

	Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine
	gun.

					AGENT SMITH
			No.

	The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a
	cacophony of CRASHING GLASS --

	As the Agents go for their weapons.

	But Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and
	BULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.

	Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back,
	blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --

	Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.

	And finally Agent Jones.

	Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.

					NEO
			Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!

	Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.

	Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into
	the adjoining room.

	He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN
	FIRE.

	Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room,
	WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving
	for cover.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Just outside the Presidential Suite, three marines
	blister with snow-static.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.  His eyes,
	still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close.

	And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing
	with fire.

	The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's
	BULLET TRAILS chase them.

	Morpheus strains at his handcuffs.

	The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD,
	RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER.

	FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping
	the handcuffs, starting for the window.

	Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open
	bedroom door.

					AGENT SMITH
			Nooo!

	He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a
	perfect line.

	For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the
	WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of
	chalk.

	And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet
	buries itself in his leg --

	Knocking him off balance.

					NEO
			He won't make it.

	Morpheus lunges, out of control --

	As Neo spins, every move a whip crack --

	Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.

	Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the
	wide blue empty space --

	Flying for a moment.

	The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord
	attached to a machine.

	As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other
	on a seemingly magnetic course until --

	They collide.

	Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs,
	scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation,
	finding hold and clinging.

	Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their
	fragile embrace.  Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over,
	falling down --

	The ground deliriously distant --

	As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed
	wrist.

					NEO
			Gotcha!

	Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.

	As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine.

	He'll bring them all down.  Targeting the helicopter, he
	aims at something only he can see: the oil line.

	PONK.  PONK.  PONK.  The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of
	holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood.

					TRINITY
			Shit-shit-no!

	Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the
	HELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE.

					NEO
			Oh fuck.

	Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the
	nearest building.

	Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the
	machine above them begin to fall.

	The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow
	while --

	The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching
	the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.

	Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic
	fall over the nearest roof where --

	Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope
	goes slack.  Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach
	himself but --

	The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof
	like a setting sun --

	The coils of slack snap taught --

	Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious
	speed towards the edge even as --

	Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand,
	grabbing for the rope with the other --

	Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us,
	when his feet hit the rain gutter --

	A fulcrum that levers him up just as --

	Trinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER,
	falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a 
	glass skyscraper.

	Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who
	stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath
	him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --

	She bounces against a shatterproof window that spider-
	cracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.

			I knew it!  I goddamn knew it!

			Morpheus!

	She runs at him, throwing her arms around him.

			Do you believe me now?  He's the
			One!  Who else could have done

			Morpheus, I know you won't believe

			We have their position.

			The extermination unit is in

			Order the strike.

	Agent Smith can't stand listening to them.  He moves to

	city.

					AGENT SMITH
			They're not out yet.


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	A metal gate is locked, the sign reading, "Station
	Closed."  Neo looks around, takes out a GUN and BLOWS OFF
	the LOCK.

	In the moist underground distance they hear the MUTED
	RING of a TELEPHONE.

	The PHONE is RINGING inside a graffiti-covered booth.

	Across from it, sitting hunched against the red concrete
	wall, is an OLD MAN.  He stares at the RINGING PHONE,
	taking a final pull off his T-bird.  No one is around.
	It continues to RING.

	Determined, he stands and walks to the booth.  He is
	about to answer the phone, when Neo sees him.

					NEO
			Don't!

	The Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly
	over the turnstiles.

					OLD MAN
			I'm sorry -- I didn't mean!

	The Old Man is shaking, terrified.  Neo looks at his gun.
	He glances over his shoulder, then eases back the hammer.

					NEO
			Get outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!

	The Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban
	cave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and
	Morpheus arrive.

					TRINITY
			What happened?  Was that --

					NEO
			It was nobody.

	Neo turns to the RINGING BOOTH.

					NEO
			Let's go!  You first, Morpheus.

	Morpheus gets in and answers the phone.

	Lost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as
	Morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its
	cord.

	His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate.  He will
	never be free of the Matrix.

	He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he
	suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around,
	staring --


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	As the Old Man stares.

	Trinity hangs up the phone.  She turns to Neo, standing
	close enough to kiss him.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus is right, you know.  It
			doesn't matter what he believes or
			even what the Oracle believes.
			What matters is what you believe.

					NEO
			I believe...

	He stares at the fullness of her lips.

					NEO
			I want to kiss you.

	She smiles.

					TRINITY
			I want to kiss you too...

	The PHONE begins to RING.

					TRINITY
			But I want it to be real.

	She pulls herself away and gets into the booth when
	something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old
	Man had been.

	She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if
	formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of
	metal.

	The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through
	the plastic WINDOW just as --

	Trinity disappears.

	The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS,
	SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.

	GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men
	BLASTING, moving at impossible speed.

	For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME.

	Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float
	forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges
	cartwheel into space.

	An instant later they are nearly on top of each other,
	rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
	reflection of the other --

	Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.

	They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting,
	Agent Smith machine-calm.

	Agent Smith smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			You're empty.

	Neo pulls the TRIGGER.  CLICK.

					NEO
			So are you.

	The smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.

	CLICK.

	Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist
	flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo
	retreating as --

	A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him
	slamming back against a steel column.

	Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into
	the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.

	Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-
	snapping reverse round-house.  Agent Smith's glasses fly
	off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue.

					AGENT SMITH
			You can't win.

					NEO
			I already have.

	He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent
	seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.

	And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an
	unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.

	Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air,
	hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel,
	where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.

	The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack
	when he hears sonething.  From deep in the tunnel, like
	an animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING
	against METAL.

	The sound of an ON-COMING TRAIN.

	Tank is trying to find another entrance.

	From the cockpit, an ALARM sounds.  Morpheus hurries to

	Trinity follows him.

	In every pipe surrounding them, they see the
	Extermination Unit.

					TRINITY
			Sentinels.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN

	The killing machine we saw in the History Program blister
	by us like tracer bullets shot down the throat of the
	abyss.


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo tries to get up.  Agent Smith jumps down onto the
	tracks and drop-kicks him in the face.

	The world begins to shake, RUMBLING as the TRAIN NEARS.

					AGENT SMITH
			Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?

	Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to
	look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a
	hole in the darkness.

					AGENT SMITH
			That is the sound of
			inevitability.

	Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.

					AGENT SMITH
			It is the sound of your death.

	There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as
	Agent Smith tightens his hold.  Neo is unable to breathe.

					AGENT SMITH
			Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

	The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.

	The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the
	pain.

	He is not ready to die.

					NEO
			My name is Neo.

	Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith
	against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.

	They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES
	INTO the station.

	Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --

	The train barrels over Agent Smith.

	Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its
	emergency brake.  With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of
	TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the
	station.

	Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the
	escalator --

	As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last
	car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his
	glasses again intact.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus checks the ship's self destruct key.

					TRINITY
			You can't use that until Neo is
			out!

					MORPHEUS
			I know.  Don't worry, he'll make
			it.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	A man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when
	his door is thrown open.  Neo yanks him out and jumps in.

	Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly
	touching his ear-piece.

	Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side-
	street.


	INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Driving like a demon with one hand, he grabs the car
	phone and dials long distance.

	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank answers.

					TANK
			Operator.

					NEO (V.O.)
			Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out
			of here!


	INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Looking over his shoulder, watching the mirrors, Neo
	drives almost unconsciously.

					NEO
			Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious
			pursuit!


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The keyboard clicking, Tank searches for an exit.
	Trinity screams into the headset.

					TRINITY
			Neo, you better get your ass back
			here!


	INT.  CAR

					NEO
			I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying.

					TANK (V.O.)
			I got one!

	Neo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now
	driving the car beside his.  Agent Brown swerves,
	slamming into him.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Wabash and Lake.  A hotel.

	Neo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the
	car up over the median.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Room 303.

	Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing
	lane --

	Directly into the charging path of an enormous truck
	driven by Agent Smith.

	Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it,
	rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other
	cars, as it EXPLODES.

	Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds
	billow up behind hin.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Three figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become
	the three agents.

	Further down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding
	ass.

	Agents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as
	Agent Jones continues chasing full-bore.

	Neo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called:
	the Heart of Chicago Hotel.

	Only Agent Jones is behind him now.

	Neo dives into the alley.  At the far end he sees Agent
	Brown charging.  Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins
	to climb.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN

	Sentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as

			I'm going to make the call.

			Do it!


	INT.  "HEART OF CHICAGO" HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Snith is in the elevator when he hears the DISTANT
	RING of a PHONE.


	EXT.  ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY

	The agents chase him, FIRING, BULLETS SPARKING and
	RICOCHETING even as Neo jumps for the third-floor
	platform.

	Neo kicks in the window, jumping into the hall.  The
	doors count backwards:  310...  309...


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus grabs the biggest gun he can find.  The lasers
	begin to slice through the hull.

					TRINITY
			Where is he?

					TANK
			Almost there.

					MORPHEUS
			He's going to make it.

					TRINITY
			Hurry, Neo.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo can hear the PHONE RINGING.

	305...  304...

	Agent Brown reaches the broken window behind him just as
	Neo grabs the handle of 303, throwing open the door to
	find --

	Agent Sniith, waiting, .45 cocked.

	Neo can't move -- can't think --

	BOOM.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Neo's body jerks, and everyone hears it as the life
	monitors snap flat-line.

	Trinity screams.  Morpheus is frozen in disbelief.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Three holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag
	carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper.

	Agent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no
	chances.

					AGENT SMITH
			Check him.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Through the lasered opening, Morpheus screams, blasting
	away at the machines; comet-wads of plasma burning holes
	in their armored housings.

	Trinity collapses onto Neo's body.

					TRINITY
			No-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead!
			You can't be dead!


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Kneeling beside him, Agent Brown checks his vital signs.

					AGENT BROWN
			He's gone.

	Agent Smith smiles, standing over him.

					AGENT SMITH
			I told you, you couldn't win.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is hit, a laser bolt knocking him to the ground.
	They can't hold them off any longer.  Morpheus lunges for
	the self destruct --

	As Trinity whispers in Neo's ear.

					TRINITY
			You're right here.  I'm holding 
			you, Neo.  I'm not letting you go.
			Do you hear me?  I won't let you
			go.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The agents walk to the elevator, leaving Neo's body
	behind.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus flicks the Plexiglas shield of the self-
	destruct.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit, Neo!  Don't give it up!
			Not now!

	She pounds on his chest.

					TRINITY
			Not now!


	INT.  HOTEL HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The BLOW ECHOES deep in his mind.

	His eyes snap open.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Trinity screams as the monitors jump back to life.  Tank
	and Morpheus stare, unbelieving.

	It is a miracle.

					TRINITY
			Now get up!


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo struggles, holding his chest, sitting up.  Down the
	hall, he sees the elevator closing and --

	Agent Smith staring at him as if he were looking at a
	Cypher.

	Neo gives him the finger.

					AGENT SMITH
			Nooooo!

	Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	A sentinel BLOWS a hole in Morpheus' right arm and he
	screams, refusing to let go of the detonator.

	INT.  ROOM 303 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo dives for the RINGING PHONE.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Machines split open the craft, pouring in, lasers
	targeting everywhere.

	A beat finds the center of Morpheus' forehead and he
	screams, ready to die.

					TRINITY
			Now!

	He turns the key.


	INT.  OVERFLOW PIT

	A blinding shock of white lights flood the chamber;
	sentinels blink and fall instantly dead, filling the pit
	with their cold, metal carcasses.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	In the still darkness, only the humans are alive.

					TRINITY
			Neo?

	His eyes open.  Tears pour from her smiling eyes as he
	reaches up to touch her.

	And she kisses hin; it seems like it might last forever.

									FADE TO BLACK.


	FADE IN:

	ON COMPUTER SCREEN

	as in the opening.  The cursor beating steadily, waiting.

	A PHONE begins to RING.

	It is answered and the screen fills instantly with the
	trace program.  After a long beat, we recognize Neo's
	voice.

					NEO (V.O.)
			Hi.  It's me.  I know you're out
			there.  I know you're working as
			fast as you can to catch me.

	We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering
	across the screen.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I thought I should call and let
			you know how things stand.

	We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the
	darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I know you're real proud of this
			world you've built, the way it
			works, all the nice little rules
			and such, but I've got some bad
			news.

	We realize that the constellation is actually the holes
	in the mouthpiece of a phone.  Seen from inside.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I've decided to make a few
			changes.

	We SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone.

	He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking,
	wearing a long black coat and dark glasses.  He passes a
	mother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --

	Neo takes off, flying up into the air.

					BOY
			Mommy!  Mommy!

					MOMMY
			What?

					BOY
			That man!  That man flies!

					MOMMY
			Don't be silly, honey.  Men don't
			fly.

	There is a RUSH of AIR as the Boy stares up as Neo shoots
	overhead.  His coat billowing like a black leather cape
	as he soars up, up, and away.

										FADE OUT.

                                       "THE MUMMY"
                

               The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on 
               the African continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT 
               rises up. WE PUSH IN on it, towards a CITY along the Nile, 
               it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP PUSHING IN until 
               the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves 
               DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not 
               ancient.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.

                                    THEBES - 2,134 B.C

               Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:

                                     NARRATOR
                         Thebes. City of the Living. Crown 
                         jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

               The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn 
               CHARIOT comes barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; 
               an aristocratic, virile old man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.

               INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK

               Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, 
               muscular MAN with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Home of Imhotep, High Priest of 
                         Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

               A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It 
               takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's 
               wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked 
               body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a 
               stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's 
                         Mistress. No other man was allowed 
                         to touch her.

               She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA 
               comes to a stop on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then 
               it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's really a strange looking 
               TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald MEN stand 
               nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their 
               eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains.

               Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, 
               feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body, 
               smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with lust:

                                     NARRATOR
                         But for our love, we were willing to 
                         risk life itself.

               And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself 
               on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush 
               over and close the doors. But just as they do, the doors 
               suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at 
               the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, -- 
               SUBTITLED.

                                     PHARAOH
                         What are you doing here?

               The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival 
               was unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws 
               them back.

               Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh 
               sees the smeared body paint. Points his finger.

                                     PHARAOH
                         WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!

               From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. 
               Pharaoh spins around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.

                                     PHARAOH
                         Imhotep?... My priest.

               Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
               his back.

               Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous 
               bald Priests SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the 
               curtains, they see the SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep 
               stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the doors are RAMMED from 
               the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and 
               look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers 
               share desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and 
               grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony.

                                     PRIESTS
                         Pharaoh's bodyguards!

               Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's 
               sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         You must go. Save yourself. Only you 
                         can resurrect me.

               Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN.

               MEN with BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over 
               their bodies stride in, armed to the teeth. These are the 
               MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony 
               just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.

               Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses --

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         My body is no longer his temple!

               She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. Out on the balcony, 
               Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream...

                                     NARRATOR/IMHOTEP
                         For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's 
                         body was to be cursed. And it was I, 
                         the High Priest, whose duty it was 
                         to curse it.

               EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT

               Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-
               su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her 
               down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Her body was mummified, her vital 
                         organs removed and placed in sacred 
                         canopic jars.

               Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of 
               pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The Book of The Living contained 
                         sacred incantations that would send 
                         the evil dead on a journey into the 
                         dark underworld.

               Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves 
               and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled 
               eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising.

               Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, 
               and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the 
               ground.

               Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus.

               The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand. 
               Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears 
               at the Nubians. Killing them.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The slaves were killed...

               Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed 
               Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as 
               Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ...and the soldiers who killed them 
                         were also slain, so that no unholy 
                         person should ever know the exact 
                         location of the burial site.

               The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the 
               Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
               vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant 
               dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's 
               grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.

               EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT

               CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the 
               way. A "hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF 
               ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But there was another book, The Book 
                         Of The Dead, which was never to be 
                         opened, never to be read, for it 
                         contained the incantations that could 
                         bring a dead body back to life a 
                         most unholy thing.

               The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. 
               They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

                              HAMUNAPTRA - City of the Dead

                                     IMHOTEP
                         It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of 
                         the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         so that no such sacrilege might ever 
                         disgrace Egypt.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT

               Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT 
               inside the giant STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and 
               lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD, made of black stone.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But for my love of Anck-su-namun I 
                         was willing to defy the gods.

               INT. UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT

               Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the 
               headstones of this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY.

               A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the cemetery, -- muck made out of 
               filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in the goop. The 
               Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless 
               eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and 
               forth as they CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures.

               In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted ALTAR.

               Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless 
               body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun's vital organs were 
                         still fresh, so a human sacrifice 
                         would not need be made.

               As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large 
               SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. Several 
               Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back 
               down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST wafts up out of the 
               swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them 
               and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the 
               heart inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING 
               HOLE, WAFTING MIST, BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are 
               reaching a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun soul had come back 
                         from the dead! Now all that was 
                         needed, was to return her organs to 
                         their rightful place within her body.

               Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's 
               breast, about to plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and 
               BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's when the Mumia BURST IN and 
               storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD MUMIA SMASHES 
               the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks 
               back out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the 
               swirling hole.

               Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS 
               in rage. The Mumia grab him and his Priests.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         My Priests were condemned to be 
                         mummified alive.

               INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER (NECROPOLIS RE-VAMP) - NIGHT

               Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed 
               EMBALMERS. He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic 
               glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive.

               The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and 
               thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING 
               Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.

               A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.

               A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His 
               eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red 
               hot poker up his nose.

               But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, 
               horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.

               WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests 
               squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.

               His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         As for me, I was condemned to endure 
                         the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient 
                         curses. One so horrible, it had never 
                         before been bestowed.

               Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's 
               TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on 
               top of it. WE GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is 
               apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue 
               onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.

               Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and 
               fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus 
               muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the 
               fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.

               He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.

               An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.

               Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the 
               bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting 
               dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.

               Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         By eating the sacred scarabs, I would 
                         be cursed to stay alive forever. And 
                         by eating me, they were cursed just 
                         the same.

               The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange 
               four-sided KEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight.

               The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a 
               loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. Once again, the Head Mumia 
               uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         I was to remain sealed inside my 
                         sarcophagus, the undead for all of 
                         eternity.

               The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses 
               the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle 
               BOX.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         They would never allow me to be 
                         released. For I would arise a walking 
                         disease, a plague upon mankind, an 
                         unholy flesh-eater, with the strength 
                         of ages, power over the sands, and 
                         the glory of invincibility.

               Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The 
               disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and 
               then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         And if I could raise my beloved Anck-
                         su-namun from her place in hell, 
                         together, we would be an unstoppable 
                         infection upon this world. The 
                         Apocalypse. The End.

               Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming 
               from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt 
               onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM:

                                        THE MUMMY

               The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave.

               Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, 
               the jackal-headed god of death. It stares at us. Then begins 
               to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only 
               seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half-
               buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.

               EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY

               Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG 
               HORSEMAN.

               Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior 
               brethren. Armed to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN 
               are the WORDS:

                                    THE SAHARA - 1925

               A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN 
               LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the 
               onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a 
               jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL.

               He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at 
               him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I knew this was gonna be a lousy 
                         day.

               A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across 
               the top of the wall. This is BENI.

                                     BENI
                         Personally, I would like to surrender. 
                         Why can we not just surrender?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

               Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's run away. Right now. While 
                         we can still make it.

               O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now gimme your revolver, you'll never 
                         use it anyway.

               Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody 
                         ever does that anymore.

               O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now go find me a big stick.

                                     BENI
                         In the desert? What for?

               O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So I can tie it to your back, you 
                         appear to be without a spine.

               The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. 
               Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How'd a guy like you end up in the 
                         Legion anyways?

                                     BENI
                         I got caught robbing a synagogue. 
                         Lots of good stuff in them holy 
                         places; churches, temples, mosques, 
                         and who's guarding them?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Altar boys?

                                     BENI
                         Exactly! I speak seven languages, 
                         including Hebrew, so my specialty 
                         was synagogues. How about you? Kill 
                         somebody?

               Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground.

               O'Connell gives him a nasty look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No, but I'm considering it.

               They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp

                                     BENI
                         What then? Robbery? Extortion? 
                         Kidnapping!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None of the above, thank you.

                                     BENI
                         Then what the hell are you doing 
                         here!?

               They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the 
               horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening.

               O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was just looking for a good time.

               And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly 
               panics, cuts and runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh shit. Steady!

               Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde 
               Hoofs pounding the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I sayin'?

               The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog 
               SCREAMS. More Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I doin'?

               The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels 
               himself, cocks and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly 
               snaps, he spits it into the sand. Another BEAT. And then --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with 
               a CRASH. The BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their 
               mounts. The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand.

               The remaining warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the 
               hot air. A third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off 
               their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg 
               force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires.

               O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING 
               riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.

               Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, 
               whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all 
               around him. He crawls through the front gate.

               O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He 
               cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off 
               their mounts.

               Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY 
               amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as 
               the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind 
               him. O'Connell's guns go empty.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Son-of-a-bitch.

               He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate.

               Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him.

               O'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running.

               He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the 
               heavy sandstone door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey! Beni! Wait up!

               Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are ya doing?! Wait up!

               O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen 
               LEAP the big column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU 
                         CLOSE THAT DOOR!

               Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell 
               SLAMS his body into the door. It doesn't budge.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm gonna get you for this!

               He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his 
               life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer 
               and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER.

               O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The 
               four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The 
               vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off.

               O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he 
               slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.

               And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them 
               REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The 
               horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like 
               fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared 
               them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their 
               mounts.

               O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right 
               hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the 
               evil himself, and turns around. -- The shattered, decrepit 
               statue of Anubis stares back at him.

               Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet.

               He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming 
               sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing 
               beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture.

               O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The 
               sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the 
               sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.

               EXT. RIDGE - DAY

               Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble 
               clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence 
               and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have 
               BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS.

               The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this 
               time.

               The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with 
               dual scimitars across his waist. His face is both handsome 
               and horrible, blue and tattooed. Meet ARDETH RAY. His dark 
               eyes watch O'Connell stagger off into the open desert...

               EXT. CAIRO - DAY

               Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their 
               positions in the sky since it's birth. A city teeming with 
               every form of life. A strange, mysterious, wonderful city.

               WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN:

                                          CAIRO

               INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon 
               rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the 
               Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between 
               two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, 
               is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- 
               a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare.

               This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with 
               her.

               Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows 
               the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books 
               whose titles all begin with the letter "O". Then she grabs 
               another book out from under her arm and reads the title.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up 
                         here?

               Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her 
               shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles 
               begin with the letter "T". Then she looks down. It's a long 
               way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down 
               on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
               across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too 
               far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder 
               with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.

               And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn 
               YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the 
               ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, 
               swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her 
               balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts 
               stiltwalking down the aisle.

                                     EVELYN
                         OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!

               The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads 
               back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling 
               for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and 
               picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into 
               another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
               bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.

               And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES 
               into the next bookshelf.

               Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She 
               looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf 
               crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after 
               bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and 
               scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last 
               shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She 
               opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other 
               eye and stares at the huge mess.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oops.

               The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.

                                     CURATOR
                         Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! 
                         Give me frogs, flies, locusts, 
                         anything but this! Compared to you, 
                         the other plagues were a joy!

               Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm sorry, it was an accident.

                                     CURATOR
                         When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it 
                         was an accident. You are a 
                         catastrophe! Why do I put up with 
                         you?

               Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.

                                     EVELYN
                         You put up with me, because I can 
                         read and write ancient Egyptian, 
                         decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, 
                         and I'm the only person within a 
                         thousand miles who knows how to 
                         properly code and catalogue this 
                         library.

                                     CURATOR
                         Who needs smart women? I put up with 
                         you because your mother and father 
                         were our finest patrons, Allah rest 
                         their souls. Now straighten up this 
                         mess!

               The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming.

               And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hello?

               Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly 
               shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.

                                     EVELYN
                         Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

               Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters --

               INT. THE RAMESSEUM

               Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. 
               It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from 
               FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery.

               The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly 
               shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch.

               Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they 
               stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She 
               walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases 
               of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this 
               one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks 
               around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans 
               forward with the torch, and peers inside.

               -- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her!

               Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out 
               of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, 
               she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad 
               crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half 
               drunk.

                                     EVELYN
                         You...! YOU...!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please 
                         call me something original.

               Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, 
               Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.

                                     EVELYN
                         Have you no respect for the dead?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right now, I only wish to join them.

               He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather 
                         than later, before you ruin my career 
                         the way you've ruined yours.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll 
                         have you know, that at this moment 
                         my career is on a high note.

               He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.

                                     EVELYN
                         High note? Ha! For five years you've 
                         been scrounging around Egypt, and 
                         what have you to show for it? Nothing.

               Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes I do! I have something right 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh no, not another worthless trinket, 
                         Jonathan, if I bring one more piece 
                         of junk to the Curator to try and 
                         sell for you.

               Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY 
               to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly 
               curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where did you get this?

               Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.

                                     JONATHAN
                         On a dig, down in Thebes.

               Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself 
               as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it.

               Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My whole life I've never found 
                         anything, Evy. Tell me I've found 
                         something.

               Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the 
               box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle 
               box. Then suddenly, it UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, 
               turning itself into the KEY. Sitting inside the open key/box 
               is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT MAP.

                                     EVELYN
                         Jonathan?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes?

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you found something.

               INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's 
               eyepiece at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         See the cartouche there, it's the 
                         official royal seal of Seti the First, 
                         I'm sure of it.

                                     CURATOR
                         Perhaps.

               Jonathan leans in from across the desk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Two questions. Who the hell is Seti 
                         the First? And was he rich?

                                     EVELYN
                         He was the last Pharaoh of the Old 
                         Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest 
                         Pharaoh of them all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Alright, good, that's good. I like 
                         this fellow, like him very much.

               The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same 
               map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I've already dated it, this map is 
                         almost four thousand years old. And 
                         the hieratics over here...
                              (Inhales deeply)
                         It's Hamunaptra.

               The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.

                                     CURATOR
                         My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, 
                         we are scholars, not treasure hunters. 
                         Hamunaptra is a myth.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the 
                         early Pharaohs were said to have 
                         hidden the wealth of Egypt.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right, right, in a big underground 
                         treasure chamber. Everybody knows 
                         the story. The entire necropolis was 
                         rigged to sink into the sand. On 
                         Pharaoh's command, a flick of the 
                         switch! And the whole place could 
                         disappear beneath the dunes.

                                     EVELYN
                         All we know is that the city 
                         mysteriously vanished around 2,134 
                         B.C.

               The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-LAMP.

                                     CURATOR
                         As the Americans would say: it's all 
                         fairy tales and hokum.

               The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws 
               it to the floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly 
               puts it out. Lifts it up. The left third of the map is now 
               missing.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You burned it! You burned off the 
                         part with the lost city!

                                     CURATOR
                         It's for the best, I'm sure. Many 
                         men have wasted their lives in the 
                         foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no 
                         one has ever found it, most have 
                         never returned.

                                     JONATHAN
                              (devastated)
                         You killed my map.

                                     CURATOR
                         I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm 
                         surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to 
                         be so fooled.

               The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches 
               it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.

               EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every 
               low-life form of scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a 
               first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across 
               the gallows courtyard. Evelyn whispers to Jonathan.

                                     EVELYN
                         You told me you found it on a dig 
                         down in Thebes!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I was mistaken.

                                     EVELYN
                         You lied to me!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I lie to everybody, what makes you 
                         so special?

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That just makes you more gullible.

                                     EVELYN
                         You stole it from a drunk at the 
                         local Casbah?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Picked his pocket, actually.

               EXT. VISITOR'S PEN - DAY

               The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what is he in prison for?

                                     WARDEN
                         I did not know, so when I heard you 
                         were coming, I asked him that myself.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what did he say?

                                     WARDEN
                         He said... he was just looking for a 
                         good time.

               The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, 
               dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars.

               From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is 
               half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new 
               bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.

                                     EVELYN
                         But he's just a filthy criminal?

                                     JONATHAN
                              (cringing)
                         Way to go, Evy.

               O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So who's the broad?

                                     EVELYN
                         Broad?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         She's my sister, actually.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a 
                         total loss.

               Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.

                                     WARDEN
                         I'll be back in a moment.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         I tremble with anticipation.

               A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face 
               bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks 
               back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         We uh,... found... your puzzle box, 
                         and we've come to ask you about it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No.

                                     EVELYN
                         No?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No... You came to ask me about 
                         Hamunaptra.

               Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards 
               didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.

                                     EVELYN
                         How do you know the box pertains to 
                         Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's where I found it. I 
                         was there.

               Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious

                                     JONATHAN
                         How do we know that's not a load of 
                         pig swallow?

               O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey,... don't I know you?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Um, well, you see...

               O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan 
               square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A 
               Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again.

               He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look.

               Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         You were actually at Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just decked your brother

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, well...
                              (shrugs)
                         I know my brother.

               O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I was there.

                                     EVELYN
                         You swear?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Every damn day.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, I mean --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         -- I know what you mean. I was there, 
                         alright. Seti's place. The City Of 
                         The Dead.

                                     EVELYN
                         What did you find? What did you see?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I found sand. I saw death.

               The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Could you tell me how to get there? 
                         The exact location?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Want to know?

               Evelyn leans in even closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Really want to know?

               She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

               O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then get me the hell outta here.

               Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off 
               the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, 
               YANKS him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where are they taking him?

                                     WARDEN
                         To be hanged.

               Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth.

                                     WARDEN
                         Apparently, he had a very good time.

               EXT. GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as 
               the hangman's noose is draped over O'Connell's head and 
               cinched tight around his neck. Evelyn follows the warden 
               onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners all go dead 
               quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh 
               meat.

                                     WARDEN
                         No women allowed.

                                     EVELYN
                         I am an English woman.

               This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.

               O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden.

                                     EVELYN
                         I will give you one hundred pounds 
                         to spare his life.

                                     WARDEN
                         I would pay one hundred pounds just 
                         to see him hang.

                                     EVELYN
                         Two hundred pounds.

                                     WARDEN
                         Proceed!

                                     EVELYN
                         Three hundred pounds!

               O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than 
               Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him.

                                     HANGMAN
                         Any last requests, pig?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

               The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.

                                     EVELYN
                         FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!

               The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.

                                     WARDEN
                         And what else?

               Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.

               Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the 
               Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!

               O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays out. Then 
               JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.

               But he's still alive, because --

                                     WARDEN
                         His neck did not break! Good! Now we 
                         watch him strangle to death.

               The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.

               The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the 
               end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly 
               turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.

                                     EVELYN
                         He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

               The warden spins around and faces her.

                                     WARDEN
                         You lie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I would never!

               At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and 
               turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.

                                     WARDEN
                         Are you saying this filthy godless 
                         son of a pig knows where to find The 
                         City Of The Dead? Truly?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes and if you cut him down, we will 
                         give you ten percent.

                                     WARDEN
                         Fifty percent.

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty.

                                     WARDEN
                         Forty.

               Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as 
               he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--
                         !

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty-five percent, and not one 
                         single farthing more.

               The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic. 
               A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES 
               to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.

               All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up 
               at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.

               CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face.

                                     CURATOR
                         She must die.

               Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA: 
               blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. One 
               of the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs.

                                     HOOK
                         She is like all the others. She will 
                         die in the desert.

                                     CURATOR
                         No! She has seen too much. She knows 
                         too much.

               The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.

                                     CURATOR
                         Not only does she have a map, but 
                         she has the key.

               Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys.

                                     HOOK
                         The key!? She has the lost key!?

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes. No one has ever had so much, 
                         been so close. We must stop her, or 
                         it will be the end of us all.

                                     HOOK
                         Then we will kill her, we will kill 
                         her and all those with her.

                                     CURATOR
                         And burn the map and retrieve the 
                         key.

                                     HOOK
                         It will be done. But what of the 
                         American expedition? They leave 
                         tomorrow as well.

                                     CURATOR
                         Forget the bumbling Americans, they 
                         will be like all the others. Without 
                         the map to guide them, how can they 
                         possibly find Hamunaptra?

               EXT. GIZA PORT - DAY

               SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI.

                                     BENI
                         It is three days down the Nile, then 
                         two days by camel, sahibs.

               WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a 
               PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS.

                                     DANIELS
                         For all the money we're paying you, 
                         something better god-damned well be 
                         under that sand.

               WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.

                                     HENDERSON
                         "Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya 
                         gotta keep sayin, to yourself, 
                         "Hamunaptra."

               Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the 
               docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn 
               and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS 
               selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you really think he'll show up?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he 
                         may be a cowboy, but his word is his 
                         word.

                                     EVELYN
                         Personally, I think he's filthy, 
                         rude and a complete scoundrel. I 
                         don't like him one bit.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Anyone I know?

               They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit 
               and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more 
               dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh... um,... hello.

               Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Smashing day for the start of an 
                         adventure, eh, O'Connell?

               O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, sure, smashing.

               He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the 
               bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.

                                     BURNS
                         You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

                                     BENI
                         Along with the scorched bones of my 
                         entire garrison, sahib.

               And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head, 
               as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the 
               men.

                                     BENI
                         A thousand pardons, my good sahibs 
                         but there is much work to be done.

               Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.

               BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mister O'Connell, can you look me in 
                         the eye, and guarantee me this is 
                         not some sort of flimflam? Because 
                         if it is, I'm warning you --

               O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks 
               her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         All I can tell you, miss, is that my 
                         Colonel found that map in an ancient 
                         fortress, and the whole damn garrison 
                         believed in it so much, that without 
                         orders, we marched halfway across 
                         Libya and into Egypt to find that 
                         city. Like I told ya, all I saw was 
                         sand. Everybody else was wiped out 
                         by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your 
                         bags.

               O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
               the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on.

               Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, 
                         a complete scoundrel, nothing to 
                         like there at all.

               Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's 
               when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy 
               hat.

                                     WARDEN
                         A bright good morning to all.

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you doing here?

                                     WARDEN
                         I have come to protect my investment, 
                         thank you very much.

               And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.

               WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
               Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into --

               EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT

               The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA 
               quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one 
               with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two 
               row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.

               EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell 
               comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we 
                         could use another good player.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I only gamble with my life, never my 
                         money.

                                     DANIELS
                         Never? What if I were to wager five 
                         hundred dollars says we get to 
                         Hamunaptra before you?

               O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yer on.

               Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

                                     BURNS
                         What makes you so confident, sir?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What makes you?

               Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We got us a man who's actually been 
                         there.

               O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what a coincidence, why --

               O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the 
               gunnysack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.

                                     JONATHAN
                         -- whose deal is it? Is it my deal? 
                         I thought I just dealt?

               EXT. BARGE - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.

               The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

                                     EVELYN
                         The only thing that scares me, Mister 
                         O'Connell, are your manners.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         If you call that a kiss.

               O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out 
               revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, 
               and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                                     EVELYN
                         Did I miss something? Are we going 
                         into battle?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The last time I was at that place 
                         everybody I was with died.

               This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts 
               dismantling and cleaning the guns.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's something out there, you 
                         know, something under that sand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain 
                         artifact, a book, actually, my brother 
                         thinks there's treasure. What do you 
                         think is out there?

               O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin 
                         believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, 
                         they call it, "the doorway to hell."

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to 
                         the underworld", actually.

               She gives him a know-it-all grin.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't believe in fairy tales and 
                         hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do 
                         believe that one of the most famous 
                         books in history is buried out there, 
                         The Book Of The Living. It's what 
                         first interested me in Egypt as a 
                         child. It's why I came here, sort of 
                         a life's pursuit.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And the fact that they say it's made 
                         out of pure gold, makes no nevermind 
                         to you, right?

               Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know your history.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know my treasure.

               Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns 
               back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:

                                     EVELYN
                         By the way,... why did you kiss me?

               O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was about to be hanged, seemed 
                         like a good idea at the time.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.

               O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Wha'd I say?

               Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly 
               reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.

                                     BENI
                         My very good friend! What a surprise.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why if it ain't my little buddy, 
                         Beni. I oughta kill you.

               O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows 
               hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.

                                     BENI
                         You never were any good with the 
                         ladies, O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So you're the one leading the 
                         Americans, I shoulda figured. So 
                         what's the scam? You get 'em out in 
                         the middle of the desert then leave 
                         'em to rot?

                                     BENI
                         Unfortunately no, these Americans 
                         are smart, they pay me only half 
                         now, half when I get them back to 
                         Cairo, so I must go all the way.

               O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.

                                     BENI
                         You never believed in Hamunaptra, 
                         O'Connell. Why are you going back? 
                         The devil himself lives out there.

               They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the 
               HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and 
               backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The girl saved my life, figured it 
                         was the least I could do, keep her 
                         out of trouble.

                                     BENI
                         You always did have more balls than 
                         brains.

               O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Let's make us even, shall we?

                                     BENI
                         Even?

               O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.

               Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack 
               and starts walking off down the deck.

                                     BENI (O.S.)
                         O'Connell! I am going to kill you 
                         for this!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sounds familiar.

               And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming 
               up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.

               O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.

               INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror.

               She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose 
               over her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE 
               IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his hand 
               over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.

                                     HOOK
                         Where is the map?

               Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees 
               the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.

                                     HOOK
                         And the key? Where is the key?

               Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins.

                                     HOOK
                         Then I'll find it myself.

               He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.

               Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.

               O'Connell looks at her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Friend of yours?

               Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table 
               FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell 
               spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.

               FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's 
               head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.

               FIRING BLINDLY. A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene 
               SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs 
               the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder, 
               right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.

               O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.

               HALLWAY - NIGHT

               O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.

                                     EVELYN
                         The map! We need the map!

               He shoves her up against a wall.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax! I'm the map!
                              (taps his forehead)
                         It's all up here.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh that's comforting.

               O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, there's still one more of 
                         those guys around here somewhere.

               EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT

               Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye 
               and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on 
               the floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks 
               him into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!!

               Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up. A 
               HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine --

               It's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.

               Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.

               EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse 
               paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.

               BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.

               O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the 
               other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.

               Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the 
               paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their 
               heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The 
               Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep 
               up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now 
               ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Can you swim?

                                     EVELYN
                         Well of course I can swim, if the 
                         occasion calls for it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Trust me.

               He picks her up and throws her over the side.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The occasion calls for it.

               Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after 
               her.

               EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, 
               guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything 
               in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Americans.

               Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH.

               Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his 
               FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes 
               widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to 
               strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook 
               over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say! Good show!

               Then he points his thumb at himself

                                     JONATHAN
                         And did I panic?

               He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I think not.

               And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan 
               dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.

               NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the 
               water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she 
               wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices.

               Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the 
               far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.

                                     BENI
                         Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I 
                         got all the horses!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on 
                         the wrong side of the river!

               Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand 
               CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking...

               BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY

               O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading 
               post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them 
               the reins of four ugly old camels.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't believe the price of these 
                         fleabags.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We coulda had 'em for free, all we 
                         had to do was give 'em your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Awfully.

               And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's 
               changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then again...

               SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in 
               the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Never did like camels. Filthy buggers. 
                         They smell, they bite, they spit. 
                         Disgusting.

               The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile 
               green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his 
               gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, disgusting.

               Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I think they're cute.

               WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the 
               desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.

               FRYING PAN - NIGHT

               The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking 
               across the vast wasteland.

               Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the 
               rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden 
               SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to 
               slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her, 
               then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking 
               her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he 
               looks up at a distant ridge --

               -- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing 
               them.

               EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY

               The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as 
               Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And you snore!

                                     WARDEN
                         I do not snore!

                                     JONATHAN
                         All night you snored!

                                     WARDEN
                         I have never snored!

               Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're almost there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Are you sure?

               O'Connell looks down at the ground.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure.

               The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking 
               out of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the 
               skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the 
               desert floor.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What in bloody hell is this?

               The Warden shivers in fear.

                                     WARDEN
                         Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

               The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of 
               the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE 
               DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel, 
               the rest ride horses.

                                     BENI
                         Good morning, my friend!

               O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred 
               feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless 
               horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.

                                     DANIELS
                         Well, what the hell we doin'?

                                     BENI
                         Patience, my good sahib, patience.

               Henderson looks over at O'Connell.

                                     HENDERSON
                         First one to the city, O'Connell! 
                         Five hundred! Cash bucks!

               O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.

               Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts 
               to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get ready.

               Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.

                                     EVELYN
                         For what?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're about to be shown the way.

               Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the 
               sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.

               Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then --

                                     DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS
                         HEYA!

               The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.

                                     DANIELS
                         SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!

               Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't 
                         we be going?

                                     EVELYN
                         After all, you rode us night and day 
                         to win that bet.

               O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard. Beni watches the 
               Americans and spits into the sand.

                                     BENI
                         Fools.

               And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.

               Passing across the sun as it goes. It's a MIRAGE.

               The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other 
               way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.

               The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.

               The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the 
               volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell 
               and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And 
               the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from 
               his horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it 
               to the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.

               The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.

               The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.

               And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.

               And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else 
               hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.

               And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.

               Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell. 
               Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!

               But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni 
               off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.

               Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never 
               felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this 
               girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of 
               the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past 
               him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn! Slow down!

               Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S 
                         A REALLY BIG --

               INT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands 
               in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.

               O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Never mind.

               The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside 
               the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy 
               hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three 
               Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats 
               flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty 
               backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.

                                     DANIELS
                         Where'd all these camels come from?

                                     BENI
                         They belong to the dead. They will 
                         wait years for their masters to return 
                         before leaving.

               EXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next 
               to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.

               O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
               the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan 
               bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS 
               and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That thing gives me the creeps.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Be nice. That thing saved my life.

               Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.

                                     EVELYN
                         That "thing" gets me excited.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         The things that get you excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to Bembridge Scholars, 
                         inside the statue of Anubis was a 
                         secret compartment, perhaps containing 
                         The Book Of The Living.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are those mirrors for?

                                     EVELYN
                         Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

               O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice.

               INT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden 
               drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you realize, we are standing inside 
                         a room that no one has entered in 
                         over four thousand years.

                                     WARDEN
                         Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're welcome to my share of the 
                         spider webs.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And it stinks to high heaven in here.

               Evelyn just rolls her eyes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Cretins.

               Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden 
               and realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops 
               sniffing.

               Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall, 
               then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF 
               LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. -- THE RAY OF LIGHT 
               HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE 
               DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT 
               RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's 
               chamber.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That is a neat trick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Preparation for what?

                                     EVELYN
                         For entering the afterlife.

               O'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Mummies, my good son, this is where 
                         they made the mummies.

               Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. The others follow.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way 
               through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat 
               warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and 
               freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.

               They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker 
               and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and 
               louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan 
               licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.

               ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               They slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
               an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.

               Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the 
               other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn 
               behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!

               O'Connell LEAPS OUT. -- THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT 
               HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because 
               it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ya scared the bejeezus out of us, 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Likewise.

               But nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one.

                                     DANIELS
                         This here is our statue,... friend.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't see your name on it,... pal.

               And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step 
               out of the shadows, -- all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are 
                         no-so-good.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've had worse.

               Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, me too.

               O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun, 
               grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then 
               Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.

                                     EVELYN
                         Let's be nice, children, if we're 
                         going to play together, we must learn 
                         to share.

               Evelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow.

               Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing.

               The Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the 
               ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my calculations, we 
                         should be right under the statue. 
                         We'll come up right between his legs.
                              (she blushes and laughs)
                         Oh my.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And when those dirty Yanks go to 
                         sleep --
                              (looks at O'Connell)
                         No offense.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None taken.

                                     JONATHAN
                         We'll sneak up and steal that book 
                         right out from under them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And you're sure you can find the 
                         secret compartment?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't 
                         already found it.

               Jonathan looks around.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what's our smelly little friend 
                         got himself up to?

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.

               A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of 
               black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred 
               beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and 
               starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's 
               found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist 
               brushes sand away from the seam. Henderson steps forward and 
               grabs the seam, -- the Egyptologist quickly stops him.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         Seti was no fool.

               Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, sure...

               He looks back at the native Diggers.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We'll let him open it.

               The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.

               The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out 
               his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers 
               hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into 
               the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless.

               Beni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back 
               away as well.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme get this straight, they stuck 
                         a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, 
                         cut your brain into small pieces, 
                         then ripped it all out through your 
                         nostrils?

                                     JONATHAN
                         OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

                                     EVELYN
                         It's called mummification. You're 
                         dead when they do this

                                     JONATHAN
                         Still...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two are worse than a couple of 
                         schoolboys.

               And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.

               O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES 
               for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE 
               CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER

               Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their 
               guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, 
               he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS --

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         FENI!

               The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, 
               The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The 
               compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers 
               give one final pull and --

               -- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS 
               THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.

               Dying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the 
               ground...

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan 
               slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.

               We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks 
                         like a sarcophagus.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why would they bury somebody in the 
                         ceiling?

                                     EVELYN
                         They didn't, they buried him at the 
                         foot of Anubis. He was either someone 
                         of great importance. Or he did 
                         something very naughty.

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then 
               greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops 
               it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly 
               falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.

               CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.

               The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to 
               WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.

               Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE 
               scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly 
               burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

               The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his 
               knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, 
               higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
               large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS 
               IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The 
               Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The 
               lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and 
               COUGHING.

               And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, 
               revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it 
               Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well?... Who is it?

               Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.

                                     EVELYN
                         'He that shall not be named.'

               O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's some sort of lock here. You 
                         say these thing's are made of granite 
                         with a steel interior?

                                     EVELYN
                         Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting 
                         out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No kiddin', without a key, it'll 
                         take us a month to crack this thing,

                                     EVELYN
                         A key! That's it! That's what he was 
                         talking about.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who was talking about what?

               Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.

                                     EVELYN
                         The man on the barge. The one with 
                         the hook, he was looking for a key.

               Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine!

               Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's 
               now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles.

               And that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through 
               the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the 
               labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden 
               starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, 
               he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the 
               labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The 
               Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, 
               breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves...

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.

                                     EVELYN
                         What do you suppose killed him?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you ever see him eat?

               O'Connell comes up over some rocks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Seems the Americans had a little 
                         misadventure of their own today, 
                         three of their diggers were killed.

                                     EVELYN
                         How?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. 
                         Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Maybe this place really is cursed.

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp.

               The campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous 
               look. Evelyn laughs.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't believe in curses, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I believe if I can see it and I 
                         can touch it, then it's real. That's 
                         what I believe.

               O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I believe in being prepared.

               Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the 
               scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY 
               PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, --
               Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the 
               pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN
                         WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!

               Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch 
               and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Seagrams!

               Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside 
               out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well, he may have been a stinky 
                         fellow,... but he had good taste.

               Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily 
               And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear 
               to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then 
               a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.

               O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Stay here!

               He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately 
               gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the 
               bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man 
                         just say -- !

               EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT

               The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS 
               gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as 
               they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill 
               multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps 
               SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.

               O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, 
               who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Goin' somewhere?

                                     BENI
                         Just looking for you, O'Connell! I 
                         wanted to be with my friend!

               O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, friend.

                                     BENI
                              (struggling)
                         Why do you like to fight so much?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         'Cause I look good doin, it.

               Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down 
               with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, 
               LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to 
               the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point 
               blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell 
               is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.

               A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, 
               misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider 
               off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.

               Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, 
               she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.

               A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly 
               backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises 
               his scimitar, about to strike.

               Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant 
               gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS 
               him twenty feet back into some ruins.

               At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and 
               over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand 
               dune.

               Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the 
               temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.

               Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let 'em have it, boys!

               Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, 
               the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, bloody good show.

               And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land 
               behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around 
               and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.

               O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something 
               THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray 
               on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises 
               his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!

               Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, 
               O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick 
               of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It 
               IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two 
               men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray 
               points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE 
                         OR DIE!

               Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after 
               him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, 
               then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn 
               staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her 
               and holds her close.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You alright?

               Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time 
               he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's 
               also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes,... fine,... thank you.

               Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and 
               Burns help Daniels to his feet.

                                     DANIELS
                         See! That proves it! Old Seti's 
                         fortune's gotta be under this sand!

                                     HENDERSON
                         For them to protect it like this, 
                         you just know there's got to be 
                         treasure down there.

               O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These men are a desert people. They 
                         value water, not gold.

               Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where's Jonathan?

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.

               Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close 
               and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.

               O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, 
               the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the 
               bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --

                                     EVELYN
                         Unlike my brother, sir, I know when 
                         to say no.

               O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Unlike your brother, Miss, you I 
                         don't get. You're a whole new brew.

                                     EVELYN
                         I know, you're wondering, what's a 
                         place like me doing in a girl like 
                         this?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Something like that.

                                     EVELYN
                         Egypt is in my blood. My father was 
                         a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so 
                         much that he married an Egyptian. My 
                         mother! Who was quite an adventurer 
                         herself

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, I get your father, I get your 
                         mother and I get your brother, but 
                         what are you doing here?

               Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.

                                     EVELYN
                         I may not be an explorer, or an 
                         adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or 
                         a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But 
                         I'm proud of what I am.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And what is that?

               Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins 
               and proudly lifts her head high.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...I am a librarian!

               She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm going to kiss you, Mister 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No you're not.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm not?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not unless you call me Rick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Why would I do that?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's my name.

               She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES 
               HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, 
               slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and 
               just smiles.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and 
               turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are 
               heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.

               They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.

               PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.

                                     EVELYN
                         I can't believe I allowed the two of 
                         you to get me drunk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Don't blame me, I don't even remember 
                         being there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well neither do I, thank you.

               O'Connell gives her a hurt look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't?

               Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.

                                     EVELYN
                         No... Why?... Should I?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Gee, yeah, you told me it was the 
                         best time you ever had.

               O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops, 
               appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF 
               and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly 
               grab their sore heads and MOAN.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the 
               secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them.

               Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out 
               the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor.

               Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         There is a curse upon this chest.

                                     DANIELS
                         Curse my ass.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, who cares.

               The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         In these hallowed grounds, that which 
                         was set forth in ancient times, is 
                         as strong today, as it was then.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

               The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         "Death will come on swift wings to 
                         whomever opens this chest".

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER 
               All the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING.

               The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         It says, there is one, the undead, 
                         who if brought back to life, is bound 
                         by sacred law to consummate this 
                         curse.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, well, let's just make sure we 
                         don't bring anybody back from the 
                         dead then, huh?

               The three Americans laugh.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         He will kill all who open this 
                         chest,... and assimilate their organs 
                         and fluids.

                                     DANIELS
                         Assimilate their organs and fluids? 
                         Ya mean eat 'em?

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         And in so doing he will regenerate. 
                         And no longer be the undead, but a 
                         plague upon this earth.

               The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and 
               the Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just 
               shrugs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next 
               to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, I've dreamed about this 
                         ever since I was a little girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You dream about dead guys?

               Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and 
               cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Look, all the sacred spells have 
                         been chiseled off. The hieratics and 
                         hieroglyphs that protect the deceased 
                         on his journey into the afterlife, 
                         they've been removed. This man was 
                         cursed,... doomed.

               O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Tough break.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see 
                         who's inside, shall we?

               Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box 
               into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a 
               HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs

               the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan 
               helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly.

               And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT 
               INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN
                         AHHHHH!!!

               They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the 
               'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years 
               have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden 
               chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background, 
               Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.

                                     BENI
                         The curse,... beware the curse!

               Beni turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits.

                                     DANIELS
                         Stupid superstitious bastard.

               And that's when the seal breaks, -- A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT 
               OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and 
               carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Is he supposed to look like that?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I've never seen a mummy look 
                         like this. He's, he's still...

                                     JONATHAN
                         Juicy?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. He's more than four thousand 
                         years old and still decomposing.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And look at this.

               O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there 
               are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, he was buried alive.

               This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         And he left a message.

               WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD.

                                     EVELYN
                         It says: 'Death is only the 
                         beginning.'

               Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's my gun?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What are you going to do? Shoot him?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed 
               at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches 
               inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes 
               widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and 
               slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book 
               Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to 
               life.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         I have heard told of this book, but 
                         I never truly believed it existed. 
                         This, good gentlemen, is a most 
                         priceless treasure.

               Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.

                                     HENDERSON
                         I wouldn't trade ya for a brass 
                         spittoon!

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta 
                         pure gold!

               Daniels kicks the chest. It breaks open, unfolding to reveal 
               a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL 
               ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels)

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni 
               are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan 
               wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What is this stuff? It smells like 
                         our late friend, the Warden.

               O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You did not!?... We're not!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Rat gizzards. They smell bad and 
                         taste worse, but that's the best the 
                         desert has to offer.

               The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Say O'Connell, whadaya think these 
                         honey's'll fetch back home?

                                     BURNS
                         We hear you gentlemen found yerselves 
                         a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

                                     DANIELS
                         Ya know if ya dry him out, you can 
                         sell him for firewood.

               The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a 
               pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.

                                     EVELYN
                         Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them 
                         inside our friend's coffin. They can 
                         stay alive for years living off the 
                         flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

               She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat

                                     EVELYN
                         Famished.

               O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are you saying somebody threw these 
                         things in with our guy, and they 
                         slowly ate him alive?

                                     EVELYN
                         Very slowly.

                                     JONATHAN
                         He certainly was not a popular fellow 
                         when they planted him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Must of got a little too frisky with 
                         the Pharaoh's daughter.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my readings, our friend 
                         suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of 
                         all ancient Egyptian curses, one 
                         reserved for only the most evil 
                         blasphemers. In all of my research, 
                         I've never read of this curse actually 
                         having been performed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That bad huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, they never used it because they 
                         feared it so. It's written, that if 
                         a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever 
                         arise, he would bring with him the 
                         ten plagues of Egypt.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The ten plagues?... You mean all ten 
                         plagues.

                                     BENI
                         Like what that Moses guy did to that 
                         Pharaoh guy?

                                     EVELYN
                         That's one way of putting it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let's see, there was frogs, flies, 
                         locusts...

                                     BURNS
                         Hail and fire.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The sun turning black.

                                     DANIELS
                         Water turning to blood.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And my personal favorite: people 
                         covered in boils and sores.

               All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just 
               laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.

                                     EVELYN
                         Fried gizzard anyone?

               EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple 
               and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the 
               Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, 
               the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn 
               stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks 
               over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.

               Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over 
               and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You sure you outta be playin, around 
                         with that?

                                     EVELYN
                         It's just a book, no harm ever came 
                         from a book.

               Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell 
               share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

               Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's 
               chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN 
               over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards 
               Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills 
               FRAME, -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!

               Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. -- BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around, 
               sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!

               He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard, 
               coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all 
               leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.

               The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the 
               darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops 
               everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their 
               side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid 
               vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.

               The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The 
               Book Of The Dead, looking haunted.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         What have we done?

               The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth, 
               slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! 
                         Billions of grasshoppers!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's one of the plagues, right? 
                         The grasshopper plague!

                                     EVELYN
                         This is not a plague. It's 
                         generational. Every so many years 
                         the locusts of Egypt have a population 
                         explosion and they all take flight.

               Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers 
               his TORCH, -- the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... and what about frogs?

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway.

               Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground, 
               they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to his feet, 
               squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness,

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels! Henderson!

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to 
               SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, -- HUNDREDS OF 
               CHITTERING SCARAB BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start 
               scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS.

               Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul 
               ass.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out 
               in front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything.

               Then ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps 
               out.

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels?... is that you?

               Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.

                                     BURNS
                         Henderson?

               Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands 
               reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEP'S PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns 
               jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at 
               them, -- HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts 
               to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just 
               ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.

               O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next 
               to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of 
               the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs 
               scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send 
               shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.

               Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then 
               they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!?

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully 
               looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels 
               her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft 
               of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A 
               MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards 
               him.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh thank goodness, you're one of the 
                         Americans, aren't you?

               Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF 
               HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, 
               she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around 
               It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is 
               down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, 
               her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun?

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! Must be a trap door around 
                         here or somethin'.

               And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson, 
               Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!

               O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of 
               CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly 
               trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and 
               help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as 
               the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through 
               him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels 
               Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already 
               running, races right past them. The others turn and haul 
               ass.

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Imhotep steps forward, -- the sand around him seems to 
               MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal 
               legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns

                                     EVELYN
                         Help me,... please,... help me.

               Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because 
               HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the 
               ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a 
               big game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his 
               fetid lips, -- A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

               Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying 
               around the corner and runs right up to her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Would you quit playin, around! Let's 
                         get outta here already!

               O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, -- at 
               the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         WHOA!

               O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.

               Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering 
               his prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts 
               to crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops 
               and UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches 
               to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial 
               SHRIEK.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his 
               fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Ahhhhhhhh!!

               Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the 
               SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his 
               ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn 
               stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN 
               ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson, 
               Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees, 
               hands over their heads. Ardeth Ray steps forward.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I told you to leave or die, you 
                         refused, and now you may have killed 
                         us all. For you have unleashed the 
                         creature that we have feared for 
                         more than four thousand years.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax, I got him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         No mortal weapons can kill this 
                         creature. He is not of this world.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are we talkin, about the same 
                         creature? The walking corpse? Really 
                         big mouth? Really bad breath?

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Beni slowly backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He 
               turns around, -- IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs 
               away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but 
               have no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the 
               back wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless.

               Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten 
               mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his 
               side. Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his 
               neck, RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain.

               Beni holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly 
               makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:

                                     BENI
                         May the good Lord protect and watch 
                         over me as a shepherd watches over 
                         his flock. And may Satan in all his 
                         forms be vanquished forever.

               It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni 
               quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them 
               out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his 
               progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a 
               Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.

               All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and 
               Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for 
               Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.

               And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses 
               himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand 
               lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (subtitled)
                         The language of the slaves.

               Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (in Hebrew -- subtitled)
                         I may have use for you. And the 
                         rewards will be great.

               Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out 
               his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes, 
               about to throw up, but then the maggots part, -- revealing a 
               tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises 
               his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Where are the other sacred jars?

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant 
               sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.

                                     DANIELS
                         You bastards!

                                     HENDERSON
                         What did you do to him!?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We saved him! Saved him before the 
                         creature could finish his work. Now 
                         leave, all of you, quickly, before 
                         he finishes you all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You're not going to kill us?

               Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We must now hunt him down, and try 
                         and find a way to kill him, before 
                         he consumes the earth. Allah be with 
                         us.

               Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.

               O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I told ya, I already got him!

               Ardeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Know this, the creature will be coming 
                         for you. He must consummate the curse. 
                         And until he does, he will never 
                         eat, he will never sleep, and he 
                         will never stop.

               Ardeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice,

               EXT. RUINS - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels 
               and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist, 
               still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.

               They all head off into the dark, windblown desert...

               And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY 
               PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC, 
               PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE --

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY

               A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front 
               gate. Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty 
               camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.

               INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY

               A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.

               O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I thought you didn't believe in this 
                         stuff!?

               O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses

                                     EVELYN
                         Having an encounter with a four 
                         thousand year old walking-talking 
                         corpse tends to convert one.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Forget it, we're out the door down 
                         the hall and gone.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, we are not.

               O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yes we are.

               O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues 
               to UNPACK them:

                                     EVELYN
                         No we are not. We woke him up, and 
                         we must try and stop him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We?! What we?! You didn't read that 
                         book. I told you not to play around 
                         with that thing.

                                     EVELYN
                         Alright then, Me, I,... I read the 
                         book, I woke him up and I intend to 
                         stop him.

               O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How!? You heard the man, no mortal 
                         weapons can kill this guy.

               Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Then we'll have to find some immortal 
                         ones.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There goes that belief again. Not 
                         me, I am outta here!

               O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.

               Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.

               O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking 
               his fingers as Evelyn follows him.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to that Book, once this 
                         creature has been reborn, his curse 
                         will spread, and as he grows in 
                         strength, so will his curse grow, 
                         infecting the people until the whole 
                         of the earth is destroyed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

                                     EVELYN
                              (incredulous)
                         It's everybody's problem!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Look lady, I appreciate you saving 
                         my life and all, but when I signed 
                         on, I agreed to take you out there 
                         and bring you back, and I did, now 
                         were even, end of job, end of story, 
                         contract terminated.

                                     EVELYN
                         That's what I am to you? A contract?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You can either tag along with me, or 
                         you can stay here and play around 
                         with Mister Maggot.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm staying.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FINE.

               O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the 
               door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a 
               handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door.

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni 
               coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his 
               face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Beni ya little stinkweed, where did 
                         you slink off to?

                                     BENI
                         You left me! You left me in the desert 
                         to rot.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
                              (gestures to Imhotep)
                         So who's this guy?

                                     BENI
                         This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest 
                         of Osiris.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

               O'Connell sticks out his hand, -- Imhotep instantly recoils 
               O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.

                                     BENI
                         The Prince does not like to be touched 
                         by other humans. A Silly eastern 
                         superstition, I'm afraid.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, well, we all got our little 
                         problems today don't we?

                                     BENI
                         He has come to help Mister Burns. 
                         Somehow I feel responsible.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't gimme that, you never had any 
                         scruples.

                                     BENI
                         Do you know where I can steal some?

               O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives 
               Imhotep a look as he strides off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         See ya around, Padre.

               Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and 
               hard liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a 
               walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers.

               He wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm the last of the Royal Force still 
                         stationed here, you know? All the 
                         other laddies died in the air and 
                         were buried in the sand.

               The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to 
               O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.

                                     WINSTON
                         Ever since the end of the Great War, 
                         there hasn't been a single challenge 
                         worthy of a man like me.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've heard it before, Winston.

               O'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I just wish I would've chucked it 
                         with the other laddies, gone down in 
                         a flame of glory, instead of sitting 
                         around here, rotting from boredom 
                         and booze!

               Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods 
               Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.

               Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment.

                                     BURNS
                         The drawer there, spectacles.
                              (tries to laugh)
                         As you see, I won't be needing them.

               Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He 
               puts the bifocals on over his death mask, -- and grins 
               broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.

                                     BENI
                         Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks 
                         you for your spectacles, -- and for 
                         your eyes,... and for your tongue.

               The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.

                                     BENI
                         But I am afraid more is needed, the 
                         Prince says he must finish the job, 
                         consummate the curse which you and 
                         your friends have brought down upon 
                         yourselves.

               A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly 
               backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the 
               sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing 
               his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               Three shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and 
               Henderson slug 'em down, -- all three of them instantly SPIT 
               OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,... 
                         like...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Blood.

               They all look at each other, even more nervous.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "And the rivers and waters of Egypt 
                         went red and were as blood."

               A look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here.

               He suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Who's here!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound, 
               knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY

               Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of 
               books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops 
               half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and 
               drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We got problems.

               And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the 
               courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain 
               bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and 
               CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here! I saw him! That thing is 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         The creature!? Are you sure!?

               O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the 
               HAIL and FIRE.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure!

               The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.

               O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM 
               is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.

               O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.

               INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY

               O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant 
               who is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they 
               spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, -- 
               HIS BODY IS SHRIVELED TO HALF IT'S SIZE.

               Drained of all organs and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are 
               shocked. Then they hear a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep 
               standing on the far side of the room. O'Connell draws his 
               gun.

               Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful 
               new musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and 
               REFORM. His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and 
               CRIES OUT, in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks 
               like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell.

               The 'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We are in serious trouble.

               Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Back off, creep.

               Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep 
               Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.

               Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're 
               all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.

               O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep 
               in the face, -- HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEP'S SKULL AND 
               GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, 
               shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of 
               Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist 
               quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as 
               if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.

               Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, 
               THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others 
               knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that 
               just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.

               He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, 
               terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         You saved me from the undead. For 
                         this, I shall make you immortal.

               He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.

               And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins 
               into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.

               Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The curse. The curse.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn 
               across the Ramesseum.

                                     EVELYN
                         There's only one person I know who 
                         can possibly give us some answers.

               They round a corner and come upon the Curator, -- who is 
               talking with Ardeth Ray. Everybody stops.

                                     EVERYBODY
                         YOU!

               O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns. Ardeth 
               Ray just scowls. The Curator nods his head.

                                     CURATOR
                         Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

                                     EVELYN
                         What is he doing here?

                                     CURATOR
                         Do you truly wish to know? Or would 
                         you prefer to just shoot us?

               Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just saw my fist vanish into some 
                         guy's head.

               He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm willin, to go on a little faith, 
                         here.

                                     CURATOR
                         You will not believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Try me.

               INT. RAMESSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

               Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The 
               First.

               We recognize his chariot and sword. The Curator sits on Seti's 
               throne.

                                     CURATOR
                         We are part of an ancient secret 
                         society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and 
                         we have a sacred mission, passed 
                         down through thirty-nine generations. 
                         For over four thousand years we have 
                         guarded The City Of The Dead. we are 
                         sworn at manhood to do any and all 
                         in our power to stop the High Priest 
                         Imhotep from being reborn into this 
                         world.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And because of you, we have failed.

                                     EVELYN
                              (appalled)
                         And you think this justifies killing 
                         innocent people!?

                                     CURATOR
                         To have stopped this creature? Yes!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's 
                         afraid of cats, what's that about?

                                     CURATOR
                         According to the ancients, cat's are 
                         the guardians at the gates of the 
                         underworld. Imhotep will fear them 
                         until he is fully regenerated, and 
                         then he will fear nothing.

               Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at O'Connell.

                                     DANIELS
                         Right! And ya know how he gets fully 
                         regenerated?! By killing everybody 
                         who opened that chest and sucking us 
                         dry! That's how!

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes, the creature must first try and 
                         regenerate, and then he will attempt 
                         to resurrect the one he has loved 
                         for more than four thousand years.

                                     EVELYN
                         Anck-su-namun.

               The Curator and Ardeth Ray look at Evelyn, thunderstruck.

                                     EVELYN
                         In the necropolis, when I saw him, -
                         alive,... walking, he called me Anck-
                         su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' 
                         quarters he tried to kiss me.

                                     CURATOR
                         It is because it was you who read 
                         from the Book. He has chosen you to 
                         be the human sacrifice needed to 
                         regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

               Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.

                                     JONATHAN
                         This is not good. Not good at all.

               Ardeth Ray has been staring out a wall of windows.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Tonight is the full moon. The moon 
                         of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

               Everyone follows Ardeth Ray's eyes, through the windows we 
               can see the SUN, -- which is now going into a FULL ECLIPSE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "...and he stretched forth his hands 
                         towards the heavens, and there was 
                         darkness throughout the land of 
                         Egypt."

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - WINDOW - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning 
               the walls. Above and beyond them, -- is the BLACK SUN.

               EXT. EVELYN'S FOYER - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer

                                     EVELYN
                         We must stop him from regenerating.

               She turns to Daniels and Henderson.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who opened that chest?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Well, there was me and Daniels here 
                         and then poor Burns of course, oh 
                         yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

               O'Connell turns from the window.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What about my buddy, Beni?

                                     DANIELS
                         Naw, he scrammed outta there,

                                     EVELYN
                         We must find the Egyptologist and 
                         bring him back here to the safety of 
                         the fort, before the creature can 
                         get to him.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you 
                         two come with me.

               All three of them pounce on him at once --

                                     HENDERSON
                         The hell with that! I'm not goin' 
                         nowhere! We're safe here.

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for 
                         nothin'.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who put you in charge? You can't 
                         just leave me behind like some old 
                         suitcase. I'm the one responsible 
                         for this mess and I intend to be the 
                         one to clean it up.

               O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.

               Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the 
               door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room 
               we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.

               O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Keep an eye on her. If you leave her 
                         door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon, 
                         Jonathan.

               Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Me?

               CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking 
               haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and 
               his SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking 
               him. A STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed 
               face.

               He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers 
               his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading 
               into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO --

               THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files 
               and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket 
               watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he 
               starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Well, well, well.

               Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

               Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a 
               chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into 
               a wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up 
               the wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's your new friend?

                                     BENI
                         What friend? You're my only friend.

               O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then you got no excuse for living. 
                         What the hell you doin, being buddies 
                         with this creep, Beni? What's in it 
                         for you?

                                     BENI
                         It is better to be the right hand of 
                         the Devil,... than in his path. As 
                         long as I serve him, I am immune.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Immune from what?

                                     BENI
                         You shall see.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are you looking for? Lie, and 
                         I'll slit your throat.

               O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.

                                     BENI
                         The book! The black book they found 
                         at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. 
                         Said to me it would be worth it's 
                         weight in diamonds.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What does he want the book for?

                                     BENI
                              (shrugs)
                         Something about bringing his dead 
                         girly-friend back to life. He needs 
                         the book...
                              (looks at Jonathan)
                         And your sister.

               O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES 
               O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.

               Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That looked rather painful.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (wincing)
                         Ya know, ever since I met you, my 
                         luck has been for crap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I know, I do that to people.

               And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming 
               from down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to 
               the window and look out --

               EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing 
               away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.

               A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred 
               canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's 
               Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and 
               catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; 
               his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a 
               huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight 
               up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.

               The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread 
               throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.

               EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! That's two down and only 
                         two to go.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And then he'll be coming after Evy.

               They turn and race out of the office.

               BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT

               Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at 
               the front gate. More Soldiers march the encircling parapet.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Ten o'clock! All is well!

               The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below

               INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT

               Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair 
               next to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with 
               fear.

                                     DANIELS
                         The hell with this. I'm goin, 
                         downstairs to get me a drink. You 
                         want somethin'?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a 
                         shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

               Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone, 
               smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his 
               SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes 
               in through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson 
               gets up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.

               The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS 
               Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.

               Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.

               His body TWISTS and TURNS and slowly SHRIVELS as the life is 
               SUCKED out of him.

               Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the wall above him, the 
               SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses, forming a SHADOW of a 
               human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the body REGENERATES.

               And then it's over.

               Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and 
               looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps 
               over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door, 
               rattles the knob. It's locked. Imhotep grins.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in 
               through the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large 
               mound. Evelyn starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO 
               THE DOOR: The mound of sand is gone and in it's place is 
               Imhotep.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a 
               stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.

               O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob, 
               still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she 
               sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.

               Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth 
               instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the 
               bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes up. Sees Imhotep's 
               rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.

               Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get your hands off my girl, pal.

               Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
               O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Nice lips.

               Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I figured you might be here, so I 
                         brought a friend.

               He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively 
               catches it.

               He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back towards the 
               window, -- which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep spins like a 
               dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.

               Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES 
               out the window and vanishes over the compound.

               Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.

               O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.

               Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on the 
               floor... and drops the martini glasses.

               INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT

               Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets, 
               HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell, 
               looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You called me your girl?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, 
                         you know, figure a speech.

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you were jealous

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see 
                         that guy's face?

               Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,

                                     DANIELS
                         Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do 
                         somethin'! we gotta do somethin, 
                         NOW! Before it's too late!

               They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.

               EXT. CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT

               A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling 
               with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins 
               to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people 
               begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a 
               severe sickness -- it's already too late.

               Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted 
               off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his 
               side, looking very nervous.

               And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow 
               Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS 
               AND SORES.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT

               O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray 
               follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.

                                     EVELYN
                         Last month I came across an 
                         inscription that mentioned The Book 
                         Of The Dead.

                                     DANIELS
                         That book we found at Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked 
                         about bringing people back from the 
                         dead. A notion I was unwilling to 
                         believe.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Believe it, sister. That's what 
                         brought our buddy back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And now he's going to use it to bring 
                         his girlfriend back

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And if he succeeds, the two of them 
                         together will bring about the 
                         apocalypse.

               The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
               stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         The plagues we have seen so far, are 
                         merely Imhotep flexing his muscles. 
                         Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's 
                         resurrection will he be truly 
                         invincible.

               They reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm thinking that if the black Book 
                         Of The Dead can bring people back to 
                         life --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of 
                         The Living can return them to the 
                         underworld.

                                     EVELYN
                         Exactly --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So your sayin', if we find the book 
                         made outta gold --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- And read the sacred incantations 
                         contained inside it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You think it'll send this guy back 
                         to hell?

                                     CURATOR
                         Correct, And that's when --

               LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside. They all rush 
               over to the upper windows and look down -- OUTSIDE: A large, 
               CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores comes CHANTING 
               up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!'

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         It has begun. The beginning of the 
                         end.

                                     EVELYN
                         Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.

               Evelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows.

               EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

               The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are 
               locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while 
               CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT

               The BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the 
               Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.

               The others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece.

                                     EVELYN
                         Got it!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got what?

               The BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn 
               talks while quickly translating the tablet:

                                     EVELYN
                         Since the black Book of The Dead was 
                         found inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         then according to this, the golden 
                         Book of The Living should be inside...

               Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What?

                                     DANIELS
                         WHAT!?

                                     EVELYN
                         The golden Book Of The Living, is 
                         inside the statue of Horus.

                                     CURATOR
                         Which would be located not far to 
                         the east of the Anubis statue.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't tell me we gotta go back out 
                         there?

                                     CURATOR
                         If we want to kill the creature, 
                         yes.

               TWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway, 
               SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray grab them and chuck them 
               over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into 
               the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN, 
               The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul ass 
               across the balcony and down the staircase.

               EXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT

               Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
               convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob 
               comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs 
               his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

               The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
               of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it 
               up and 180's it back over to the bushes.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Ray and the Curator jump 
               inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.

                                     BENI
                         Imhotep! IMHOTEP!

               Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
               windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points 
               a finger at Beni as they race past him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're gonna get yours, pal!

               Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman 
               size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.

               His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out 
               of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.

               EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT

               The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.

               Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the 
               car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them 
               overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, 
               CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before 
               they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He 
               TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a 
               corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing 
               several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! 
               CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like 
               rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.

               The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them 
               and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down 
               his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, 
               and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He 
               holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through 
               his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

               WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased 
               mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...

               INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT

               The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE 
               DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to 
               O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.

               All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.

               Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the 
               windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses 
               control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

               They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob 
               quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his 
               gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into 
               his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way 
               to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth 
               Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the 
               lit match near the fuse.

               The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring 
               at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.

               And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, 
               he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did 
               the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.

                                     EVELYN
                         He's gorgeous.

               O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He 
               YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it 
               across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives 
               O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         He has consummated the curse, now 
                         all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun 
                         from the dead, then it will be the 
                         end of us, and the beginning for 
                         them.

               Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell 
               LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops, 
               watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The 
               tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the 
               stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward 
               and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on 
               Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Koontash dai na.

               Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.

                                     BENI
                         Take his hand and he will spare the 
                         others.

               Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty 
               crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, 
               waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, 
               powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Any bright ideas?

               O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, fresh out.

               Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to 
               take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, -- 
               but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't do it, Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                         I have no choice.

               Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes 
               around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

                                     BENI
                         Come with me my princess. It is time 
                         to make you mine, forever.

               Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him --

                                     EVELYN
                         All eternity, idiot.

               Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.

                                     EVELYN
                         You better think of something, because 
                         if he turns me into a mummy, you're 
                         the first one I'm coming after.

               O'Connell almost smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got guts, lady.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep 
                         them.

               Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and -- 
               RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine -- !

               Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.

               O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of 
               Ardeth Ray's grip.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!

               The huge, powerful man holds him tight.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Be calm. There is still time. We can 
                         stop him yet.

               The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep 
               stops and looks back at O'Connell.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Pared oos.

               Evelyn SCREAMS.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!!

               Beni smiles.

                                     BENI
                         Kill them.

               Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's 
               grip and stumbles forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         EVELYN!

               But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.

               O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE 
               COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after 
               him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole.

                                     CURATOR
                         Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

               The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth 
               Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator 
               apart.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the 
               watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a 
               LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then 
               more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.

               O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead 
               of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby 
               fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.

               FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.

               STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

               The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air, 
               followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE...

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We gotta get her back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I'm with you, old man. No one touches 
                         my sister like that and gets away 
                         with it.

               O'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You know where he's taking her?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the 
                         ritual.

               Jonathan looks worried.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And what ritual would that be?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
                         su-namun back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And how does one do that?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         By reading the Book Of The Dead.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes, of course.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And then killing your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me?

               Ardeth Ray looks at O'Connell.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Imhotep is now able to cross the 
                         desert with great haste.

               Jonathan taps him in the shoulder.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Begging your pardon, but I wasn't 
                         quite clear on that last part.

               Ardeth Ray ignores him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         If he arrives before us, it will be 
                         too late.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you say 'kill' my sister?

               O'Connell smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know how to beat him to it.

               And on that WE SMASH CUT TO -- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN 

               Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set 
               of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with 
               R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:

                               HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP

               EXT. QUONSET HUT - DUNES - MINUTES LATER

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray stand before Winston 
               Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's your little problem got to 
                         do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not a god-damned thing.

               Winston looks intrigued.

                                     WINSTON
                         Is it dangerous?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You probably won't live through it.

               This really interests him.

                                     WINSTON
                         By Jove, do you really think so?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Everybody else we've bumped into has 
                         died, why not you?

               Winston nods his head, he's hooked.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's the challenge then?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         To save the damsel in distress, kill 
                         the bad guy and steal his treasure.

               A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives 
               them a snappy salute.

                                     WINSTON
                         Winston Havlock at your service, 
                         sir!

               SAHARA - DAY

               Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the 
               dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to 
               dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it, 
               they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS 
               INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.

               Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.

                                     EVELYN
                         What just happened?

                                     BENI
                         All I remember is him turning into a 
                         blast of sand,... and then I remember 
                         nothing.

               Then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.

               INT. BIPLANE - DAY

               The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in 
               the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle 
               across the left wing, Ardeth Ray is tied tight to the right.

               Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.

               EXT. SAHARA - DAY

               Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size, 
               he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. -- And 
               a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert

               BIPLANE - DAY

               O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise 
               up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees 
               what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the 
               plane into a dive.

                                     WINSTON
                         Hang on, men!

               WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting 
               biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.

               O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT 
               FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.

               O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and 
               FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the 
               sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw 
               unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.

               Winston blindly fights for control, elated.

                                     WINSTON
                         We're going down!

               The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING. 
               Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston 
               Havlock LAUGHING.

                                     WINSTON
                         Here I come, laddies!

               O'Connell braces himself for impact,

               SAHARA - DAY

               Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         Stop it! You'll kill them!

               Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare 
               into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes 
               herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.

               EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY

               The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside-
               down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls 
               out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed 
               into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me... A little help would be 
                         useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH 
                         TROUBLE!!

               O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to 
               the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's 
               mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a 
               cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell 
               and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.

               A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the 
               sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and 
               look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides 
               away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane 
               vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND...

               HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the 
               volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, now what the hell does this 
                         Horus guy look like?

                                     JONATHAN
                         He's a big fellow with pointy ears 
                         and a face like a falcon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got it.

               HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY

               Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make 
               their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading 
               into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.

               NECROPOLIS - DAY

               Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She 
               stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through 
               the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his 
               rifle into her back and pushes her forward.

                                     BENI
                         Keep moving.

               Evelyn gives him a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know, nasty little fellows such 
                         as yourself, always get their 
                         comeuppance.

               Beni suddenly looks worried.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah?

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh yes, always.

               Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on 
               his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the 
               disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed 
               doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, look at that.

               He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in 
               his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to 
               glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Say, gents! You should come have a 
                         look at this.

               The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the 
               scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into 
               Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.

               O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The 
               scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips 
               out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's 
               arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in 
               front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being 
               cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.

               The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying 
               back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

               O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM!

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and 
               Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years 
               ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.

               Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC 
               JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's 
               heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading 
               from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a 
               mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.

               Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.

               TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking 
               mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests.

               They bow to Imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell helps Ardeth Ray mend Jonathan's wound.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         From now on, don't touch anything. 
                         Not a damn thing. Keep your hands 
                         off the furniture, got it?

               Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni 
               holds his gun on her, translating:

                                     BENI
                         Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

               Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but 
                         that it's already taken.

               Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel 
               encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.

                                     BENI
                         He wants your heart and your brain, 
                         your liver, your kidneys...

               Evelyn's eyes widen.

                                     BENI
                         ...and how do you say? Those slimy 
                         things, in your stomach?

                                     EVELYN
                         Intestines.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah! Them.

               Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         You only want me for my organs?!

               Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her -- WAP!

               Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold, 
               malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums.

               Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.

               TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and 
               drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his 
               gunnysack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him.

               O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting 
               through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a 
               wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his 
               gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning 
               the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And WHAM! THE SHAFT 
               OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM 
               FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.

               It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing. 
               Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless. That's 
               when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who the hell are these guys?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Priests. Imhotep's priests.

               O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I never killed a priest before.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         They are evil, cursed, they matter 
                         not.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Well, okay then.

               O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.

               BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.

               O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips 
               through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy, 
               blows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.

               The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the 
               loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh come on, gimme a break here.

               And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning 
               over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS echoing 
               out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into another of 
               Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and 
               crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage 
               from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (ancient Egyptian -- 
                              subtitled)
                         Kill them! Kill them all! And bring 
                         me the Book Of The Living!

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray back away from the mummy pieces. The floor 
               where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two 
               more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More 
               mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of 
               the piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes.

               O'Connell lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Ray stops him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         My turn.

               Ardeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit 
               out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now.

               O'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING 
               as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies 
               and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.

               Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at 
               all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels 
               and rolls about.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. She 
               blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the 
               ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY

               The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into 
               the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a 
               passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This whole place is comin, alive!

               The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around 
               another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical. 
               Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray 
               FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I'm out.

               He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into --

               HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               -- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of 
               HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.

                                     JONATHAN
                         There he is!

               They run up to the base of the statue,

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hello Horus old boy.

               O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the 
               passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a 
               stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Allow me.

               O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to 
               look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes 
               the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.

               Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the 
               passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.

               Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing 
               the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way 
               out, -- another dark, creepy passageway.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly 
               struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start 
               surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous 
               mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds 
               even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths 
               in the room.

               Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His 
               hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed 
               cheek.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the 
               secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth 
               Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the 
               dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These guys just don't quit.

               Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells 
               and runs off towards the mummies.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Keep digging!

               O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder 
               on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.

               The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?

               Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts...

               And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND 
               and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST 
               up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with 
               the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.

               One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another 
               grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A 
               third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.

               AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL 
               THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in 
               the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.

               A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Ardeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the 
               base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate 
               chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the 
               lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.

               He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he 
               reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD 
               Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces 
               as they stare at it in wonder.

               The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel 
               and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Save the girl! Kill the creature!

               The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.

               O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it 
               against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's the last one, we better get 
                         lucky.

               The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, -- but now here's a hole 
               for them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through 
               the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY

               Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled 
               with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.

               Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.

               Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him 
               and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the 
               door.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock 
               back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.

               Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling 
               hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and 
               into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.

               The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.

               The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and 
               IMHOTEP'S READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty 
               EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.

               Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with 
               empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then 
               she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         With your death, my love and I will 
                         be invincible!

               He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in horror. And that's when O'Connell and 
               Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.

               Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I found it, Evy! I found it

                                     EVELYN
                         Shut-up and get me off of here!

               O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand, 
               jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.

               The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.

               Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial 
               knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests 
               stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.

               EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:

                                     EVELYN
                         Open the book, Jonathan! Open the 
                         book! That's the only way to kill 
                         him!

               O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies, 
               fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly 
               SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan fumbles 
               with the book, struggling to open it, -- he can't.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't open it! It's locked or 
                         something!

               O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his 
               sword down at Evelyn, -- CLANG! One chain breaks free.

               Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS along 
               the binder. It hits him like lightning --

                                     JONATHAN
                         We need the key!

               Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain 
               around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket 
               He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

                                     EVELYN
                         Read the inscription on the cover!

               O'Connell swings his sword down again, -- CLANG! Evelyn now 
               has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell 
               force him back.

               Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription, 
               but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Keetash-something, naraba-something.

               Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching 
               the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

               Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.

               O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding 
               Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

               Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.

               And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES 
               through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen. Only better.

               The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares 
               angrily down. Jonathan stares back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh boy.

               O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This just keeps gettin, better and 
                         better.

               Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.

               O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, 
               frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, 
               forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to 
               head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her 
               around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.

               Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in 
               ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for 
               O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus 
               moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

                                     JONATHAN
                         You have got to be joking?

               Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Finish the inscription, idiot!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh.

               Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best 
               she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on 
               the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now 
                         what is this last symbol here?

                                     EVELYN
                         What's it look like!?

               Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis 
               corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's 
               MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares 
               at the inscription, slightly oblivious.

                                     JONATHAN
                         It's an Anck symbol, with two little 
                         squiggly lines above it, and a bird, 
                         a stork! on either side.

               Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes,... I see.

               The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hootash im Ahmenophus!

               The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks 
               and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell 
               slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, 
               Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream 
               just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to 
               powder and DRIVING her into the ground.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily 
               heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly 
               backpedals on his hands and heels.

               O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for 
               Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden 
               Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall.

               O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP!

               SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still 
               clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and 
               spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay pal, let's see how tough you 
                         are without your right arm.

               Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him 
               half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a 
               gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes 
               it off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Alright,... so he's left handed.

               Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up 
               his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I got it!

               Evelyn runs for Jonathan.

               O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten 
               flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep 
               looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.

               Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.

               O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS 
               him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,

               SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage 
               in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS 
               into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in 
               the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with 
               him.

               He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.

               Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.

               Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed 
               hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn 
               yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working 
               the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.

               Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, 
               swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES 
               through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.

               No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and 
               casually flings it away.

               The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan 
               holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages 
               looking for something.

               O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat 
               and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed 
               mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, 
               then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About 
               to die.

               Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:

                                     EVELYN
                         Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! 
                         PARED OOS!!

               Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror 
               on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which 
               starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.

               And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out 
               of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The 
               mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits 
               attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.

               Imhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.

               Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, 
               Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of 
               The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden 
               book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like 
               he's about to cry.

               Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's 
               body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.

               Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the 
               beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One 
               last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep 
               is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, 
               he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.

               O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword 
               scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across 
               Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the 
               blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.

               O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him 
               backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus 
               bog. The sword still in his stomach.

               Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as 
               Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And 
               then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at 
               them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               Evelyn translates:

                                     EVELYN
                         Death is only the beginning.

               Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile.

               STAFF CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight 
               of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large, 
               ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag 
               over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.

               A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF 
               DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.

               Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.

               ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons 
               of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber.

               CEMETERY - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls 
               start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon!

               He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking 
               pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower 
               and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick 
               the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees.

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure 
               chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the 
               treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again 
               and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards 
               a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of 
               the sinking walls is deafening.

               Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn 
               and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a 
               staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already 
               half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet 
               high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.

               Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives, 
               but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.

               O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of 
               time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --

                                     BENI
                         O'CONNELL!!

               O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand 
               back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.

               Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as 
               the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks 
               around with his diminishing torch.

               All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's 
               trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over 
               in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.

               Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.

                                     BENI
                         Go away.

               He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens 
               upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.

               Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.

               And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.

               And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.

               And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a 
               pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE 
               DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the 
               front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.

               They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind 
               them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the 
               wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels 
               race out into the desert...

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PLATEAU - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the 
               plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the 
               sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well,... I guess we go home empty 
                         handed.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Wouldn't say that.

               Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms 
               around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.

               Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs 
               up onto a camel.

               When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, 
               then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs 
               Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her 
               arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.

                                     O'CONNELL/JONATHAN
                         TUK-TUK-TUK!!

               The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag 
               behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can 
               see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.

                                         THE END
